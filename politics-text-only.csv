Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) asked a panel of Trump۪s judicial nominees to indicate if they had never tried a case to verdict in a courtroom. Matthew Spencer Petersen, a nominee for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, raised his hand. Kennedy proceeded to press him on legal matters. KENNEDY: Have you ever tried a jury trial? PETERSEN: I have not. KENNEDY: Civil? PETERSEN: No. KENNEDY: Criminal? PETERSEN: No. KENNEDY: Bench? PETERSEN: No. KENNEDY: State or federal court? PETERSEN: I have not. It only got worse from there. Petersen, who is currently the chairman of the U.S. Federal Election Commission, struggled to answer more questions as it became clear he did not have the experience typically expected of a federal judge. KENNEDY: As a trial judge, you۪re obviously going to have witnesses. Can you tell me what the Daubert standard is? PETERSEN: Sen. Kennedy, I don۪t have that readily at my disposal but I would be happy to take a closer look at that. That is not something I۪ve had to contend with. KENNEDY: Do you know what a motion in limine is? PETERSEN: Yes.. I haven۪t, I۪m, again, my background is not in litigation as when I was replying to Chairman (Chuck) Grassley (R-Iowa), I haven۪t had to um, again, do a deep dive. Petersen then began ticking off his experience in a decision-making role۝ at the FEC. Kennedy interrupted him: KENNEDY: Yes, I۪ve read your resume. Just for the record, do you know what a motion in limine is? PETERSEN: I would probably not be able to give you a good definition right here at the table. KENNEDY: Do you know what the Younger abstention doctrine is? PETERSEN: Um, I۪ve heard of it...but I, again. KENNEDY: How about the Pullman abstention doctrine ? PETERSEN: I... I heard... KENNEDY: Y۪all see that a lot in federal court. A number of Trump۪s judicial nominees have come under fire for not being fit to serve on the federal bench. Four of his court picks have been rated not qualified۝ by the American Bar Association ۥ an embarrassingly high number to receive the abysmal rating in a president۪s first year. One of them, district court court nominee Brett Talley, withdrew his nomination this week. Part of the reason this keeps happening is that Trump is nominating judges at a breakneck pace without taking the time to thoroughly vet their backgrounds. That۪s leading to problems later in their confirmation process, as senators discover more details about their background. Many of Trump۪s court picks are being funneled to him by the The Federalist Society, a right-wing legal organization focused on filling up courts with conservative judges. Kennedy is one of few Republicans critical of Trump۪s judicial nominees, saying at one point the president is  getting some very, very bad advice .۝ See Kennedy۪s full exchange with Petersen above.

The picture, snapped by a White House photographer traveling with the president as he left his golf course in Sterling, Va., went viral almost immediately. News outlets picked up the story when it appeared in a White House pool report.Late-night talk show hosts told jokes about the encounter and people on social media began hailing the unidentified woman as a she-ro,۝ using the hashtag #Her2020 . The woman۪s name is Juli Briskman. Her employer, government contractor Akima LLC, wasn۪t so happy about the photo.They fired her over it. In a Saturday interview with HuffPost, Briskman, a 50-year-old mother of two,said she was stunned that someone had taken a picture of her giving Trump the middle finger. As the photo circulated online,Briskman decided to tell Akima۪s HR department what was happening when she went to work on Monday.By Tuesday,her bosses called her into a meeting and said she had violated the company۪s social media policy by using the photo as her profile picture on Twitter and Facebook. They said, We۪re separating from you,۝ said Briskman. Basically, you cannot have lewd۪ or obscene۪ things in your social media. So they were calling flipping him off obscene.۪۝ Briskman, who worked in marketing and communications at Akima for just over six months,said she emphasized to the executives that she wasn۪t on the job when the incident happened and that her social media pages don۪t mention her employer. They told her that because Akima was a government contractor, the photo could hurt their business, she said. Virginia is an employment-at-will state, meaning employers can fire people anytime and for any reason. But Briskman said what۪s been particularly infuriating is that a male colleague kept his job after recently posting lewd comments on his Facebook page that featured Akima LLC as his cover photo. She said this colleague was reprimanded for calling someone a fucking Libtard asshole۝ on Facebook, but was allowed to delete the post and keep his job. How is that any less obscene۪ than me flipping off the president?۝ she asked. How is that fair?۝ Akima did not respond to requests for comment via email and phone. Asked what she was thinking when she saw Trump۪s motorcade roll up next to her, Briskman said it was a gut reaction to flip him off. He was passing by and my blood just started to boil,۝she said. I۪m thinking, DACA recipients are getting kicked out. He pulled ads for open enrollment in Obamacare. Only one-third of Puerto Rico has power. I۪m thinking, he۪s at the damn golf course again.۝ I flipped off the motorcade a number of times,۝ she added. Briskman, a Democrat, said she plans to look for a new job with an advocacy group that she believes in, like Planned Parenthood or PETA. Despite getting fired,she said she has no regrets about the attention her public show of displeasure with Trump received. In fact, she said she۪s happy to be an image of protest that resonates with many Americans. In some ways, I۪m doing better than ever,۝she said. I۪m angry about where our country is right now. I am appalled. This was an opportunity for me to say something.۝ UPDATE: 11:54 a.m. Monday ۥ Akima۪s website went down later Monday . Here۪s a screenshot . UPDATE: 11:41 a.m. Tuesday ۥ Briskman۪s friends have started a GoFundMe campaign to help her raise money while she looks for a new job."

So after a man in a hat bearing the elite Army paratrooper unit۪s insignia was pictured throwing a Ku Klux Klan salute (which resembles and is sometimes mistaken for a Nazi salute) during the weekend۪s Charlottesville protests ,the division delivered a pointed message. Anyone can purchase that hat,۝ 82nd Airborne wrote on its official Twitter page. Valor is earned.۝ The infantry unit, nicknamed the All American Division, was reacting to a photograph that Brandon Friedman, a former Obama administration official, shared of the demonstrator on Twitter. The image was retweeted more than 20,000 times Monday. The 82nd Airborne, which played a critical role in the Allied win at Normandy, northern France, on D-Day in 1944, was swift and scathing in its response to the image. In response to one Twitter user who asked for the identity of the man in the hat, the division replied that it did not know.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-knows-end-is-near_us_5a3bb7f7e4b06d1621b2394b","Republicans in Congress, as well as people surrounding Donald Trump۪s inner circle in the White House, clearly know something. They۪re trying to get everything they can, looting the store, taking everything off the shelves like it۪s the end times. The walls are closing in as the special counsel investigation continues unabated ۥ causing some in the GOP to to try to damage it ۥ and as the Resistance becomes supercharged, expanding the Democrats۪ chances of making big wins in 2018. The GOP has even lost its last fig leaf of moderationۥMaine senator Susan Collinsۥwho۪s been having a meltdown in the past few days after being exposed in much of the media, having voted for the Trump tax scam and not received in return promised votes on shoring up Obamacare markets. (Now GOP leaders are telling her they will come in 2018 ...sure.) Collins, who voted for Trump۪s most misogynistic judicial nominees, hostile to a woman۪s right to choose, has devolved into claiming she۪s now a victim of an unbelievably sexist۝ media, sounding every bit like what the alt-right would call a whiny snowflake. There۪s been much speculation about why Republicans would pass an enormously unpopular tax bill knowing that the narrative of a tax bill at the time of its passage usually doesn۪t change later, no matter what the reality turns out to be. Many have pointed to the White House and GOP leaders wanting a win of any kind, and needing to placate donors ۥ and even being honest about it ۥ taking a risk with voters. That۪s certainly true for some. Others have pointed to GOP senators, some of whom are leaving Congress, benefiting personally from the bill , the most notable example being Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee flipping his vote after additions to the bill benefited real estate investors like himself (He has adamantly denied this). I۪ve been saying for a while that much of the motivation, however, also seems to be desperation among many Republicans who see the handwriting on the wall. Between the Russia investigation and Trump۪s plummeting approval, they know Trump will fall, or that they will soon lose control of the House and possibly the Senate ۥ or both. This would explain why even White House officials like Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and White House economic advisor Gary Cohn backed a plan that will hurt Trump with his base and will further his downfall: These Goldman Sachs alums, too, stand to benefit greatly from the tax bill , and they likely see that this might be the last thing they get before the Trump administration collapses. Cohn has certainly both criticized and mocked Trump enough behind his back (in addition to faking bad reception to hang up on Trump) for us to imagine he is not acting in Trump۪s best political interests. Trump, too, is clearly freaking out about the Russia investigation and is desperately trying to cling to his base, no matter what the costs. The reckless announcement to r ecognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel , while it played well to several factions in Trump۪s shrinking base, has caused reverberations around the world, forcing Mike Pence to cancel his trip to the Middle East , bringing a rebuke from the United Nations General Assembly and seriously raising tensions in a way that will come back to haunt Trump and the U.S. Banning transgender people from the military (though courts have put this on hold ) and the news reported last week that the Centers for Disease Control has been told by the Trump administration to ban in budget documents words and terms like transgender,۝ fetus۝ and science-based,۝ plays to evangelicals ۥ whose support for Trump has dropped by 17 percent in a recent Pew poll ۥ but horrifies most Americans who can see signs of a turn toward fascism. But while Trump may believe these desperate moves will help him, the GOP in Congress knows that Trump can۪t win again by only playing to his decimated base. Trump۪s 2016 win ۥ without the popular vote and with Russian interference and James Comey۪s recklessness ۥ was a fluke in which he won the Electoral College by less than 85,000 votes in three states ; his base has shrunk (and slowly keeps eroding) and nothing is bringing it back. By placating some aspects of the base ۥ like evangelicals ۥ with the aforementioned actions, he۪s actually scaring away others in the base, and GOP leaders see this. From Virginia to Alabama, they know the blue wave is building into a possible tsunami next fall. They will use every sleazy tactic at their disposal, from voter suppression and ID laws to looking the other way of more possible Russian interference , but it may not be enough to overcome the wave. That will be compounded by the corruption and misjudgments of some of the candidates that the GOP۪s base, often with the help of Steve Bannon and other extremists, will back in primaries ۥ as we saw in Virginia and Alabama. All of this means that, as horrifying and demoralizing as the current climate is, and as damaging as this tax scam will be for years to come, progressives and Democrats must stay committed and determined because of a very real shot at beating the crap out of the GOP at the ballot box in 2018. And Trump may be taken down, either before finishing his term or in 2020 (if he۪s not taken down by the GOP first in GOP presidential primaries). Undoing the catastrophic damage that Trump and the GOP have created since the start of the Trump presidency will take years. Some of it may be impossible to undo, something the GOP is banking on. But it seems pretty clear that if progressives stay energized and don۪t let up, Democrats will take back power. And it seems even more clear the GOP knows that.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/al-franken-two-more-women-groping_us_5a15a455e4b09650540ec295","Two more women have told HuffPost that Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) touched their butts in separate incidents. These are the third and fourth such allegations against Franken in the past week. Leeann Tweeden, a radio host, wrote last week that Franken had kissed and groped her without her consent during a 2006 USO tour. On Monday, Lindsay Menz accused Franken of groping her at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. The two additional women, who said they were not familiar with each others۪ stories, both spoke on condition of anonymity. But their stories, which describe events during Franken۪s first campaign for the Senate, are remarkably similar  and both women have been telling them privately for years. In a statement to HuffPost, Franken said, It۪s difficult to respond to anonymous accusers, and I don۪t remember those campaign events.۝ The first woman, who spoke to HuffPost on condition of anonymity because she۪s worried she۪ll be harassed online for making the allegation, said Franken groped her when they posed for a photo after a June 25, 2007, event hosted by the Minnesota Women۪s Political Caucus in Minneapolis. My story is eerily similar to Lindsay Menz۪s story ,۝ the first woman said. He grabbed my buttocks during a photo op.۝ The second woman told HuffPost that Franken cupped her butt with his hand at a 2008 Democratic fundraiser in Minneapolis, then suggested the two visit the bathroom together. She spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear that the allegation could affect her position at work. My immediate reaction was disgust,۝ the second woman said. But my secondary reaction was disappointment. I was excited to be there and to meet him. And so to have that happen really deflated me. It felt like: Is this really the person who is going to be in a position of power to represent our community?۪۝ I can categorically say that I did not proposition anyone to join me in any bathroom,۝ Franken told HuffPost. We Stood Next To Each Other ... And Down His Hand Went۪ The first woman, a 38-year-old book editor who was living in Minneapolis at the time, told HuffPost that she had just finished performing with a feminist choir at the Women۪s Political Caucus event, which Franken and his wife, Franni Bryson, attended. After the ceremony, she and other members of the choir approached him for photos. My mother loves Al Franken. She listened to Air America [on which Franken had a radio show] every day,۝ the first woman said. ۝I saw him and asked if we could take a photo together for my mother, and we stood next to each other ... and down his hand went.۝ HuffPost spoke to two sources close to the first woman who corroborated her account. One fellow choir member, Sarah, remembers not only being there for the groping incident but hearing another choir member say that Franken wouldn۪t stop looking at her chest. Ten years ago, it was easier to shrug off predatory behavior as boys being boys,۝ Sarah said, especially when that predatory behavior came from a political ally. At the time ... people weren۪t as willing to speak against people they felt like were on their side,۝ Sarah said. It۪s really disappointing. And it۪s crappy. Ten years ago we were also at an age where there was still a feeling of powerlessness, or that boys will be boys.۝ The first woman۪s best friend, who likewise wished to remain anonymous, remembers hearing about the groping incident the day after it happened. She was in this all-women۪s choir and he was at an event where she performed, and she told me that he basically grabbed her ass,۝ the best friend said. It was a Can you believe this happened to me?۪ kind of thing.۝ The first woman wanted to tell her story because Franken is a serial groper,۝ she said. Only two people have come forward, and people are saying that this is a right-wing conspiracy,۝ she said. It۪s not. I۪m a liberal person. ... I voted for him after this happened.۝ I Was Completely Mortified۪ The second woman, who said she was groped at a fundraiser, told HuffPost it took place in the fall of 2008 at the Loft Literary Center in Minneapolis. She was excited about attending the event and meeting someone she wanted to support. I had never attended anything like that,۝ she said. She and her friends found Franken and introduced themselves to him. I shook his hand, and he put his arm around my waist and held it there,۝ the second woman said. Then he moved it lower and cupped my butt.۝ I was completely mortified,۝ she added. In order to escape the situation, the woman excused herself to go to the bathroom. At that point, she said, Franken leaned in and suggested that he accompany her. She grabbed her friend and fled to the bathroom without him. The second woman told several people ۥ including one of the reporters for this story, Zachary Roth ۥ about the incident some years ago, but didn۪t want it reported then. She said she didn۪t tell anyone at the time of the incident because inappropriate behavior from men was not that unusual to her or her friends. Sexual harassment happens so often, you have to learn how to move on,۝ she said, describing her thinking at the time. Several other factors also left her feeling powerless. I felt like I didn۪t have a voice,۝ she said. This man had all of the power, all of the authority. In addition, he is a white man and I am a woman of color. I was 21 years old. And I was afraid that he would use all of those privileges to discredit me, to make me feel even smaller than I already felt.۝ Today, she said, she feels more confident, in part thanks to the flood of women who have come forward over the last month to share stories of sexual harassment by powerful men. I couldn۪t see all these other women come forward and not walk the walk myself,۝ she said. I wanted my report to be a way for other women to say, Yes, that happened to me and I don۪t have to be afraid.۪۝ Like the second woman, the first woman waited years before deciding to go public with her story. She laughed off the incident at the time, she said, even telling other people about it as a sort of party trick.۝ It wasn۪t until recently, she said, that she felt safe talking about how uncomfortable she۪d felt. On Oct. 12, shortly after The New York Times and The New Yorker published bombshell reports about sexual assault claims against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein that drove the #MeToo social media campaign to new heights, the first woman posted on Facebook about her experience. Are we all sharing which famous man has groped us?۝ she wrote. Mine۪s Al Franken.۝ Men should be held to the same standards regardless of their politics,۝ she said. He۪s an imperfect messenger for a progressive platform. He can۪t claim to be for women۪ and also grope them.۝ Do you have a similar story? Email us at scoops@huffpost.com, or message us securely ."
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/american-flag-disrespect-tru_us_59c7140be4b06ddf45f867a0","President Donald Trump accused athletes on Friday of disrespecting the American flag when silently protesting by kneeling or sitting while the national anthem is played. On June 14, 1923, or Flag Day, a federal code was put in place that would serve as a guideline for how to handle the American flag. A viral Twitter thread brought the almost century-old standards back into the spotlight on Saturday. There are several sections in the code about proper national anthem conduct, how to display the flag, and how to respect the flag in general . The code does state that everyone during the national anthem, all present except those in uniform should stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart,۝ but the guidelines are not legally bindingʉۥ more like official suggestions about how to treat what the code calls a living thing.۝ Here are some things that Americans do on a regular basis that are considered disrespectful according to the Flag Code:  American flag clothing The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery. It should never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds, but always allowed to fall free.۝ That means every American flag swimsuit, button-up shirt, and even those famous Old Navy flag shirts, can be considered disrespectful.  The flag shouldn۪t be carried flat The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.۝ Most people know the flag should never touch the ground, but few know that it has to be displayed vertically.Maybe it۪s a nod to the lyric that had the flag gallantly streaming۝ in the air. Whatever the case, an unfurled flag that sits flat is a disrespect to the Flag Code.  Drawing on the flag The flag should never have placed upon it, nor on any part of it, nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature.۝ This one seems pretty self-explanatory. Most people understand that drawing on the symbol of the country will probably be seen as disrespectful. But freedom of expression is a constitutionally protected right, so artists (and the rest of us) are still free to make that choice.  Disposable flag products It should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions or handkerchiefs and the like, printed or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard.۝ Sorry to put a damper on probably every Fourth of July cookout ever, but if the paper plate supporting that juicy burger has a flag on it, the Flag Code says that۪s disrespectful.  Flag advertisements The flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever.۝ If a business or company is using a flag in its advertisements, that۪s yet another disrespectful gesture. A flag printed on a disposable flier is probably a double offense.  Flag uniforms No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform. However, a flag patch may be affixed to the uniform of military personnel, firemen, policemen, and members of patriotic organizations.۝ It seems like sports teams are running afoul of the guidelines by putting the flag on uniforms.The only way to respectfully wear the American flag on a costume is with a patch۝ on the side of the uniform for service members, firefighters and police officers, according to the code. This article has been updated to include more details about the code۪s legal standing and its rules about conduct during the national anthem."

It۪s amazing to see how the media is able to bully the President of the United States into going along with their FAKE NEWS narrative,۝ Duke tweeted. Soon after that, in an anti-Semitic, racist Periscope video rant , Duke spoke directly to Trump, claiming white nationalists abhor violence.

When you۪re under attack ... you panic and you do things that are stupid and you do things that are wrong,۝ Duke said. Trump made an address to the nation on Monday, after two days of withering criticism for a vague Saturday statement that criticized hatred and bigotry on many sides.۝ Racism is evil, and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, Neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans,۝Trump said. Lawmakers from both parties had called Trump out for not specifically denouncing hate groups in the wake of a white nationalist rally that left three people dead, including two state troopers, and at least 19 injured. Some white supremacist organizations, such as the Daily Stormer, praised Trump۪s vague weekend statement. Duke at the time appeared to warn the president against calling out white nationalists, a group that has largely embraced Trump. Duke said on Saturday that the rally would help fulfill Trump۪s promises.۝ This represents a turning point for the people of this country,۝ Duke said. We are determined to take our country back. We are going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump.۝"

A tweet by Ariana Grande following the deadly bombing in May at the end of her concert in Manchester, England, previously held the top spot with 2.7 million likes. Obama tweeted the quote from Mandela۪s autobiography Long Walk to Freedom a few hours after James Alex Fields Jr., 20, plowed his car into marchers protesting the Unite the Right۝ rally attended by various white supremacist groups on Saturday, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer . Also killed that day were two on-duty Virginia state troopers whose helicopter crashed on the outskirts of Charlottesville. President Donald Trump responded to the clashes in Charlottesville in a very different way on Saturday, saying: We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides ۥ on many sides,۝ Trump said on national television. It۪s been going on for a long time in our country, not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama. It۪s been going on for a long, long time.۝ Trump also tweeted about the violence numerous times on Saturday. None of his tweets, however, specifically condemned any white supremacy extremist groups. Trump۪s most popular tweet addressing the events in Charlottesville on Saturday had not gotten more than 190,000 likes as of Tuesday morning. The others didn۪t exceed 125,000 likes. Facing bipartisan criticism over his initial responses, Trump on Monday was more explicit in comments he made at the White House. Racism is evil, and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, Neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to what we hold dear as Americans,۝ he said. This article was updated on Tuesday night to show that Obama۪s tweet is the most liked ever. CORRECTION: This article initially misstated how many likes Trump۪s Charlottesville tweets from Saturday received."

A small number of the more than 3 million residents in Puerto Rico still without power were gifted paper towels, which Trump apparently thought was the most pressing need for those in the crowd. Video of the event shows him tossing the paper towels like a child trying to play basketball. It۪s all very underwhelming. After Puerto Rico۪s governor told Trump that only 16 people had been reported dead,Trump said the storm wasn۪t a  real catastrophe ۝ like Hurricane Katrina. Everybody watching can really be very proud of what۪s taken place in Puerto Rico,۝ he added. Later on Tuesday,the government revised the death count to 34. The number is likely to go up again as more information about the storm۪s destruction emerges. During Tuesday۪s visit, Trump also lambasted Puerto Rico for creating a budget strain. I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you۪ve thrown our budget a little out of whack,۝ he said. The comments follow a public lashing Trump gave to San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul_n Cruz after she begged the U.S. government for help. Instead, Trump attacked her on Twitter while at his New Jersey golf resort. Retired Lt. Gen. Russel L. Honor̩ tore down the president۪s tweets. The mayor۪s living on a cot, and I hope the president has a good day at golf,۝ Honor̩ told CNN. At least now the people of Puerto Rico have some towels to help clean up the mess Trump has exacerbated."

The president suggested that officers should hit suspects۪ heads on the doors of their police cars. When you see these towns and when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see them thrown in, rough, and I said, Please don۪t be too nice,۪۝ Trump said. Like when you guys put somebody in the car and you۪re protecting their head, you know, the way you put their hand over, like, don۪t hit their head and they۪ve just killed somebody, don۪t hit their head, I said, You can take the hand away, OK?۪۝ he added. His remarks received significant applause. Trump also made the dubious claim that laws were horrendously stacked۝ against police officers and said he wants to change those laws. For years and years, [laws have]been made to protect the criminal,۝ Trump said. Totally protect the criminal, not the officers. You do something wrong, you۪re in more jeopardy than they are. These laws are stacked against you. We۪re changing those laws.۝ In his speech, Trump also said that police officers in many parts of the country couldn۪t do their jobs because they had a pathetic mayor۝ or a mayor who doesn۪t know what۪s going on.۝ Those comments also received a lengthy applause. It۪s sad, it۪s sad. You look at what۪s happening, and it۪s sad,۝ Trump said. We۪re going to support you like you۪ve never been supported before.۝ Trump also spoke about violence in Chicago, which was a consistent theme of his speeches throughout the campaign and is a topic he has continued to reference during his presidency. Trump recalled speaking to an impressive۝ and rough cookie۝ police officer from Chicago, and said the officer had told him he could straighten out the city۪s violence problem in a couple of days۝ if he was given the authority. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Trump may not be getting along these days, but the two are on the same page when it comes to policing. Sessions has had the Justice Department pull back from pattern or practice۝ investigations that look into widespread constitutional abuses in police departments. Zeke Johnson, senior director of programs at Amnesty International USA, said Trump۪s inflammatory and hateful speech will only escalate tensions between police and communities,۝ putting both officers and civilians at risk. Police cannot treat every community like an invading army, and encouraging violence by police is irresponsible and reprehensible,۝ he said. Vanita Gupta, who headed the Justice Department۪s Civil Rights Division under former President Barack Obama, said Trump۪s remarks were unconscionable۝ and undermined the positive efforts of local law enforcement to build up community trust. The president of the United States, standing before an audience of law enforcement officials, actively encouraged police violence,۝ Gupta said. We call on the president to immediately and unequivocally condemn police brutality. We can all respect our law enforcement officers without sanctioning unjust and illegal behavior.۝ Robert Driscoll, a former Justice Department Civil Rights Division official under the President George W. Bush administration, was also critical."

To Jack Rosenthal, the hate-filled imagery was something he never thought he۪d see again, at least not in the United States. Rosenthal is one of 10,000 Romanian refugees who came to America after World War II. At 88 years old, he still mourns the loss of seven family members who died in the Auschwitz death camp. He was the only one to survive. He was born and raised in a farming village in northern Romania. Altogether in my village, there were 26 Jewish families,۝ Rosenthal told HuffPost. Most of them didn۪t survive either. Ultimately, hundreds of thousands of Romanian Jews were massacred in pogroms, slaughtered in death camps or otherwise murdered by Romanian authorities, German forces and others during the war. Rosenthal was 16 when he was taken to Auschwitz, the German Nazi camp in occupied Poland. Later, he was transferred to Buchenwald, another camp near Weimar, Germany, where he was forced to work for the Nazisʉۥ the only reason he was kept alive until U.S. military forces began to evacuate the camp۪s 28,000 prisoners in 1945. He came to the U.S. hoping to find a new beginning. After I was liberated, I thought to myself the world has learned what terrible traces hate can bring to humanity,۝ he said. And now this gives me a depressing feeling because it۪s happening again, and it۪s happening now.۝ The successful real estate agent watched the protests from his home in Roslyn, New York, where he lives during the warmer months of the year. In the winter, Rosenthal flies to Florida. Decades later, he remembers how hard it was to get settled in the U.S.while dealing with the trauma from the war. When I came here, I used to get really bad nightmares and I would get up in middle of the night not being able to go back to sleep,۝ he said. Those days of lingering fear and uncertainty felt much closer after watching neo-Nazis rage during the violent demonstrations in Charlottesville, he said. But after all the anti-Semitic speeches and the deadly car attack , it was one particular detail that caught Rosenthal۪s attention. He noticed it while reading about a Aug. 14 court hearing for James Alex Fields Jr., the man accused of plowing his car into a crowd of counterprotesters at the white nationalist rally, leaving a 32-year-old woman dead and injuring at least 19 other people. The article included a photo of Matthew Heimbach, who had helped promote the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, voicing his displeasure outside the courtroom after a judge denied bail for Fields. The white supremacist۪s T-shirt was the first thing Rosenthal saw. On the shirt was a picture of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, a pre-WWII leader of the Romanian fascist Legion of Saint Michael the Archangel and the Iron Guard political party, which were both linked to the Nazi party. Codreanu urged the destruction of the Jewish community in Romania. Members of his Iron Guard responded with brutality both before and during the war, including a horrifying massacre in Bucharest that killed over 100 Jews. I recognized the name right away,۝ Rosenthal said. You see something like this, you know, it brings back memories and I۪m concerned about what could happen in this country,۝ he said. The groups behind the Unite the Right rally are not the only ones of their kind. According to a February report from the Southern Poverty Law Center , at least 917 hate groups exist throughout the country. Many Americans were concerned when President Donald Trump failed to immediately condemn white supremacy in responding to the Charlottesville violence. Instead, Trump blamed both sides of the protests ۥ a point he repeated on Tuesday. You cannot compare fascism and Nazis to the other people protesting. Maybe there are people on both sides who are misguided, but there is simply no comparison,۝ Rosenthal said. And he reminded us that the consequences of going through horrific violence never really end. It۪s 70 years after the war and it still has a tremendous impact on me,۝ he said. It۪s something I۪ll never forget and that۪ll always be with me as long as I live.۝ CORRECTION: Due to an editing error, the number of Jews killed by the Iron Guard was significantly overstated in an earlier version of the story. The individual pogroms that killed thousands and tens of thousands of Jews in Romania during World War II were carried out by official Romanian and German forces."

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anthony-scaramucci-what-went-wrong_us_59811cc9e4b02b36343ec1da","I received a call Monday night from Roger Stone, the infamous political prankster and Donald Trump confidant. He wanted to talk about Anthony Scaramucci , whose 10-day tenure as White House communications director had just ended in ignominy. Stone said that Scaramucci reminded him of a suicide bomber,۝ then switched centuries for his next metaphor. The administration is like the French Revolution,۝ Stone said. You never know who will be beheaded next.۝ But Stone didn۪t believe that Scaramucci would stay far from the president for long. As you know, none of us are ever really gone. He still has the president۪s cellphone, the president۪s private number. Just because he۪s not in the White House, no one should think his influence has gone.۝ When I spoke to Scaramucci on Tuesday afternoon, the financier was more interested in justifying his recent past. From the beginning of his time in the Trump White House , way back on July 20, critics said that Scaramucci was too similar to Trump, too eager to be on TV, to last. Scaramucci was keenly aware of that particular liability. It explains why his opening news conference was so filled with compliments for the president. He knew there was only one person watching whose opinion of him mattered. The president thought I killed it,۝ Scaramucci told me the following day, still clearly hyped up by his experience in the White House briefing room. If you were 7 inches taller, I۪d be worried,۝ Trump told Scaramucci, according to someone familiar with the conversation who asked not to be named quoting the president. The euphoria wouldn۪t last long. A Politico reporter alerted Scaramucci that Ryan Lizza of The New Yorker tweeted Wednesday night that Scaramucci was at dinner with the president, first lady Melania Trump, Fox News host Sean Hannity and former Fox News co-president Bill Shine.  Scaramucci was livid about the information being passed on to a reporter. For one thing, he said the guest list was incomplete. The tweets didn۪t mention the presence of Ainsley Earhardt and Brian Kilmeade, co-hosts of Fox & Friends,۝ as well as White House counselor Kellyanne Conway and Vice President Mike Pence , who, he said, left before the sit-down dinner. For another, he knew that the full guest list also included Kimberly Guilfoyle, co-host of The Five۝ on Fox News. Early the next morning, Olivia Nuzzi of New York Magazine confirmed that Guilfoyle was there. Scaramucci realized that the inclusion of Guilfoyle would raise suspicion. He said he was aware that some associates and members of the media were gossiping about his friendship with the Fox host and feared this particular connection would only make matters worse. He said he took it as an attack.۝ Scaramucci strongly denies having a sexual relationship with Guilfoyle. Stone, a friend of Guilfoyle۪s, explained that Scaramucci and Guilfoyle are very close friends but nothing more.۝ He added, He is way too short for Kimberly.۝ Through a Fox News spokesperson, Guilfoyle said she۪s known Scaramucci for years through her work at Fox News and the two are good friends.۝ As soon as Scaramucci returned from Wednesday night۪s dinner, he called Lizza and gave his now-infamous interview , published Thursday, in which he suggested that former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus was a paranoid schizophrenic۝ and that White House chief strategist Steve Bannon practiced auto-fellatio. Scaramucci said he felt burned by the interview.  The Lizzas and Scaramuccis have been friends for over 50 years. My dad knew his dad from construction, and we were building a personal relationship. Most of what I said was humorous and joking. Legally, it may have been on the record, but the spirit of it was off. And he knew that.۝ Still, Scaramucci told me, he has plans to take Lizza out for a beer. When I asked Lizza for his response, he wrote back:  I۪ve only known Anthony in his capacity as a Trump surrogate and then White House communications director. We are not and have never been old family friends,۪ though I think our fathers knew each other, so maybe that۪s what he۪s talking about. (The Long Island Italian world in that generation is relatively small.) But again, that would not be a reason to suppress an explosive on-the-record interview.۝ According to several sources close to the White House, the president was initially amused by the Lizza exchange but changed his opinion when he saw how much negative attention it was bringing. Scaramucci said he offered to resign before the weekend. The president told him that wouldn۪t be necessary, but he instructed Scaramucci to watch it۝ in the future, according to someone familiar with the conversation. I spoke with Scaramucci on Saturday morning, and he sounded defeated. I think I have strep,۝ he said. On top of everything else, the night before, The New York Post had broken the news of his impending divorce from his second wife, Deidre Ball. That Scaramucci۪s marriage was in trouble was hardly a secret. Long before Ball filed for divorce on July 6, Scaramucci was open with friends and associates about what he believed to be the sorry state of their union and how they were struggling through regular counseling sessions. He just hated that his relationship was being discussed in public. A follow-up report from the Post said that Scaramucci didn۪t attend the birth of their son last week. Instead, he sent Ball a short congratulatory text. Scaramucci said this is an unfair characterization of events. He told me that Ball۪s due date was Aug. 9, so when he boarded Air Force One to West Virginia last Monday to attend the president۪s address at the National Scout Jamboree, he didn۪t think he۪d be in danger of missing the birth. As soon as she texted him that she was going into labor, he said, he looked into chartering a plane from West Virginia but discovered that there was a wide no fly-zone around Air Force One. He explained that he decided to wait to fly back to Washington with the president, then travel to New York from there. As of Tuesday afternoon, he still hadn۪t met his son. Scaramucci claimed that right after the birth Ball texted him her request for some space. When I asked about this text, Ball۪s lawyer, Jill Stone, responded: Any texts of that nature had nothing to do with the baby or seeing the baby.۝ (Jill Stone said she couldn۪t comment on the rest of Scaramucci۪s version of events.) When I spoke to Scaramucci on Saturday, he didn۪t have much to say about the collapse of his marriage. It۪s fine. I mean, what am I going to do?۝ He perked up when he started talking about the fantastic team he was going to bring into the White House۪s communications shop and the big plans he was going to enact after a tumultuous first week. But on Monday morning, Scaramucci knew he was cooked. Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly , the new chief of staff, who insisted that all White House staff report to him, asked for his resignation. It was a very polite conversation,۝ Scaramucci says. Scaramucci then went to see Trump, who was unavailable. He ended up speaking with the president, his daughter Ivanka Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, separately later in the day by telephone. All were gracious, he said. The president told me he knows I have his back, but he has to try to tighten the ship.۝ So what are you going to do next, I asked him. I am now going to go dark,۝ he said. And then? Then I will reemerge.۝ He paused. As me.۝ CLARIFICATION:The section about Ryan Lizza۪s and Olivia Nuzzi۪s tweets was changed to more accurately reflect the night۪s sequence of events."

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-manafort-daughter-trump-texts_us_59f748b6e4b03cd20b832fe0","Paul Manafort ,the former Trump campaign chairman who was indicted on federal conspiracy and money laundering charges Monday, has a long history of ties to pro-Putin groups in Ukraine.He also has a long history of connections to Donald Trump . According to leaked texts sent and received by his daughter, Andrea Manafort Shand, the two pals were perfect allies.۝ The Trump administration has been working overtime to downplay Manafort۪s role in last year۪s campaign. Paul Manafort was brought in to lead the delegate process, which he did, and was dismissed not too long after that,۝ White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday. Paul was brought on sometime in June, and by the middle of August he was no longer with the campaign,۝ then-press secretary Sean Spicer said in March. Spicer۪s statement was untrue, and Sanders۪ claim was misleading. The public record shows that Manafort, who had known Trump for decades ,joined his campaign toward the end of March 2016. And Manafort۪s eventual resignation didn۪t necessarily indicate he was leaving Trump۪s orbit, according to his daughter۪s texts. Manafort Shand may have wanted to inflate her father۪s role to impress her friends. But even after her father stepped down from the campaign last August , Manafort Shand was under the impression that he had continuing influence within the Trump campaign and beyond. The following texts, sent by Manafort Shand to her sister, Jessica Manafort, and to friends and part of a cache discovered by the website Krypt3ia earlier this year, offer a markedly different understanding of the Trump/Manafort relationship than the president and his allies are attempting to sell.(Manafort previously confirmed the authenticity of several of the other texts to Politico.) The texts have been lightly edited for grammar and clarity. March 17, 2016: The Manafort daughters claim Trump asked their father to run his campaign. Jessica Manafort: Guess who called Dad last night and asked him to run his convention. Andrea Manafort Shand: Mom told me he was going to call dad. She told me to get ready for Trump to be president and pick the position in the White House I want. JM: Dad gave him his list of requirements and so long as he can fulfill the list, Dad accepted. March 29:Even before he was announced as campaign chairman, her father۪s role was much larger than the public knew,Manafort Shand claims. Friend: I۪m not paying enough attention to really form an opinion. But yea I think economy makes sense, just hate what an asshole[Trump] is in the process. AMS: Well hopefully my dad will help scale that back. That۪s part of the reason he was brought on. He is refusing payment. Bc he doesn۪t want to be viewed as Trump۪s employee. Only having his expenses covered. He is involved purely because he wants to help the country and he thinks trump is best, so long as trump gets trained a bit. PS this is all top secret, so please do not repeat. AMS: Dude he is second in command. Perhaps arguably running it. The campaign manager is all for show. [Corey Lewandowski] doesn۪t do shit. Trump has been managing his own campaign April 7: Manafort Shand paints her father as a master manipulator who is a close ally of Trump۪s. [ After sending her friend a CNN article hinting at Manafort۪s expanded role within the campaign. ] Friend: Is Paul getting a bigger role?! Seems like it ... AMS : You۪re surprised?? I told you this was the game. You think Paul does anything in moderation? Friend : And like, if Trump gets elected, guess who۪s gonna be chief of staff ... AMS : Phffff. He would never accept. Friend : Too many skeletons in his closet? AMS : Too constrictive. Paul is a lone wolf. Has to go his own way. Do what he wants when he wants how he wants. He doesn۪t have room for other people and their needs/wants. Friend : Yea that sounds about right AMS : He likes the challenge. That۪s why he۪s doing this. It۪s a game for him. He isn۪t being paid. Friend : Man I bet he۪s loving it. AMS : This is pure sport. He is a power hungry egomaniac. Yes. He is loving it. Conclusively. Him and trump are perfect allies for this agenda. It۪s so weird he is my dad. [ Later ] AMS : It۪s just weird. Like[my dad] doesn۪t seem that smart. Like he is smart. But I know I۪m smarter than him. Friend : I don۪t doubt that, he۪s a master manipulator. Which seems pretty key. AMS : He is very manipulative. I did inherit that ability. But I don۪t exploit it like he does. I know all his tactics. They aren۪t that brilliant but they do work. Friend : But yes you۪re right, you have a moral conscious [sic]. AMS : Like he just tells you the sky is green over and over. And eventually you are like is it? I don۪t possess the ability to just lie like he does. Friend : Yea he works his charm. AMS : It۪s confidence. When you say something unwaveringly, people start to believe it. Friend : I mean yea that got Trump where he is today. AMS : Yup. Perfect allies. Trump probably has more morals than my dad. Which is really just saying something about my dad. My dad is a psycho!!! At least trump let his wives leave him. Plus, Trump has been a good father. AMS : Trump waited a little too long in my opinion, but I can attest to the fact that he has now hired one of the world۪s greatest manipulators. I hope my dad pulls it off. Then I can sell my memoir with all his dirty secrets for a pretty penny. [ Later, Manafort Shand talks to another friend about her feelings regarding the campaign. ] AMS : He was brought on to be convention manager, but really it was always to run shit. And now that۪s being publicly known. Or acknowledged I guess. [ Later ] JM : Dad and Trump are literally living in the same building and mom says they go up and down all day long hanging and plotting together April 12: Manafort Shand offers campaign-related favors from her father to a friend. AMS : By the way, if you want to exploit my dad to better your career, please let me know. Friend : Are you serious? AMS : Completely. Friend : I wouldn۪t be opposed to exploiting him. AMS : I am on a business email basis with my dad. [ Later ] AMS : My dad is Trump۪s right-hand man right now and will be through November. But he won۪t accept any position in the White House, so his leverage will diminish at that point (assuming Trump wins). April 13: Manafort refused payment as a power play, his daughter claims. AMS : Yup. That۪s a match made in heaven. Egomaniacs galore. AMS : But yea[my dad is] super tight with the Trumps. All the kids call him all the time. And him and Trump both live in Trump Tower in NYC. So it۪s like a sitcom. Although  top top secret. Can۪t repeat, promise? My dad isn۪t getting paid for trump. Friend : WHAT, really? AMS : He refused payment. Trump is only covering expenses. Friend : Political favors later? AMS : Eh maybe but the truth of it is, I think there are rules for how much you can pay campaign personnel, so it isn۪t much to start with  not to my dad anyway. And my dad wants Trump to listen to him and respect him. View him as an equal, not as staff. So refusing payment makes it so. And makes it clear to Trump why my dad is doing it  because he wants to. AMS : And my dad won۪t take an appointment either. Trump knows that, too. So this isn۪t for personal gain for my dad, and that۪s true  not a game. So why is my dad doing it? Sport. AMS : This is his wheelhouse. And he gets off on power too. My dad loves challenges and this is like a chess game. He got a mistress because he was bored. Trump is his new mistress. May 19:Although her father was never officially co-manager with Lewandowski, Manafort Shand claims that was effectively the case. [ After sending her friend a link to an ABC article about Manafort moving up yet again within the campaign .] AMS : My mom told me they were gonna call them co-managers, and then Corey went to Trump۪s son-in-law,Ivanka۪s husband, and burst into tears about how that would ruin him. So since my dad doesn۪t care about titles, this was the compromise. May 26: Manafort Shand offers campaign-related favors from her father to Lockheed Martin. Friend : Helleeew! I have an awkward favor/question to ask, so if you۪re not down, I totally understand. I۪m not sure how you and your dad are these days, and I۪m gonna guess you۪re overloaded with requests to get in touch, but if it۪s do-able, could you help me get in touch with or pass on an email to someone in your dads office? AMS : Sure, what۪s your end goal? Friend : It۪s not an effort to help the campaign. My dad works for Lockheed Martin, and they want to essentially let Trump۪s transition team know that they۪re ready, available, and happy to provide info about defense acquisition and sustainment. So to discuss policy. But they can۪t reach out to Trump۪s team  the team would have to reach out to them. So I۪ve got an email with info that would be amazing if passed on to the right people. Again  if this is not your cup of tea, totally forget I asked. I۪m only asking bc it۪s my dad. AMS : I hear ya  it۪s not a problem, I just think it۪s probably a bit early. But I can ask my mom who the right person would be to receive the email. I would imagine Rick Davis or Rick Gates. But I۪ll find out and let you/them know. Friend : Thank you!! I really appreciate it. I think they want to get in front ahead of time instead of play catch up. I feel weird asking for a favor like this haha. AMS : You۪re not the first. It۪s no bother. I am happy to be a conduit. I just can۪t promise anything other than initial access. Friend : Just being a conduit is amazing! Zero expectations, just doin what I can for my dad so anything at all is fucking great. AMS :Totally get it. Not every day you know the man behind the man. Gotta exploit it. Which is why I am happy to help. Cuz fuck it, hopefully someone can benefit by my relation to the count of Monte Cristo. June 20: Manafort had enough sway to pick Trump۪s vice president,his daughter claims. AMS : My dad is picking VP. So there۪s that. Aug. 17: Trump hires Steve Bannon and promotes Kellyanne Conway . Manafort Shand claims that her father was really the one who hired them and that public perception of his being sidelined is incorrect. AMS : [My dad] hasn۪t been demoted. That۪s total bullshit. No surprise that the media is wrong. Again. My dad hired those 2 people. Interviewed them in trump towers Aug. 19: Manafort Shand claims that her father۪s resignation was merely to appease the public, but that he۪s still very much involved. AMS : So I got to the bottom of it. As I suspected, my dad resigned from being the public face of the campaign but is still very much involved behind the scenes. He felt he was becoming a distraction and that would ultimately take a toll on the campaign. Friend : Wow. Well, I۪m really glad he۪s still part of it. Seriously, who knows what would have happened at the convention if he wasn۪t running the show. AMS : Yes for sure. He said that, in the next few weeks, we should hopefully be seeing a new Trump, so to speak. Last night۪s speech was a speech my dad had been pushing him to make for several weeks, and since it was so well-received, he thinks Trump will be more responsive to doing things a bit differently. [ Later ] Friend : Thoughts go out to your pops  I can only imagine that he۪s relieved, angry, hurting, a combination of a lot of emotions. Wishing you and your fam the best AMS : Hahaha, you۪re so silly. It۪s all just PR. Paul Manafort, Andrea Manafort Shand and the White House did not respond to requests for comment."

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/eric-bolling-fox-news-text-messages_us_5984d2bbe4b0cb15b1be6d65","Eric Bolling, a longtime Fox News host, sent an unsolicited photo of male genitalia via text message to at least two colleagues at Fox Business and one colleague at Fox News , a dozen sources told HuffPost. Recipients of the photo confirmed its contents to HuffPost, which is not revealing their identities. The women, who are Bolling۪s current and former Fox colleagues, concluded the message was from him because they recognized his number from previous work-related and informal interactions. The messages were sent several years ago, on separate occasions. The women did not solicit the messages, which they told colleagues were deeply upsetting and offensive. One of the recipients said that when she replied to Bolling via text, telling him never to send her such photos again, he did not respond. Four people, outside of the recipients, confirmed to HuffPost they۪d seen the photo, and eight others said the recipients had spoken to them about it. For this story, HuffPost spoke to 14 sources in and out of Fox News and Fox Business, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity either because they currently work at the networks and aren۪t allowed to speak to members of the press without prior authorization or because they have confidentiality agreements with Fox News and its parent company 21st Century Fox. Over the past year, the network has been rocked by multiple accusations of sexual harassment and assault by Fox News and Fox Business executives and on-air talent. Last year, former Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes resigned after former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson filed a lawsuit accusing him of sexual harassment. Since Ailes was forced out, multiple former and current Fox News hosts have accused him of harassment, including CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota. Last April, after a bombshell New York Times report revealed that Bill O۪Reilly had quietly settled multiple sexual harassment suits, the network forced him out. Reached Friday by HuffPost about the accusations against Bolling, a Fox spokesperson said,ʉWe were just informed of this and plan to investigate the matter.۝ When asked whether Bolling at any point had sent unsolicited lewd or inappropriate text messages or emails (including an image of a man۪s genitalia) to Fox News or Fox Business colleagues, his attorney Michael J. Bowe responded, Mr. Bolling recalls no such inappropriate communications, does not believe he sent any such communications, and will vigorously pursue his legal remedies for any false and defamatory accusations that are made.۝ Bolling, a former commodities trader, has worked at the Fox News and Fox Business networks since 2007, when he joined after leaving CNBC. He has had a history of making misogynistic on-air remarks during his tenure at Fox News, the most notable during a September 2014 segment on the panel show The Five۝ while discussing the first woman fighter pilot from the United Arab Emirates leading the bombing of the Islamic State. Bolling asked on air if instead of saying boots on the ground۝ it would be more appropriate to say boobs on the ground.۝ He apologized the next day, citing a look۝ he got from his wife when he arrived home. The allegations against Bolling recall statements he made attacking Anthony Weiner in 2014, after the former New York congressman had been embroiled in a scandal for sexting several women. During a Twitter war with Weiner, Bolling concluded with a tweet that said: text us if you want a fair & balanced intv **NO SEFIES PLEASE [sic]**۝ In May 2017, when Weiner pleaded guilty to federal charges of exchanging lewd messages with an underage girl, Bolling said , He is a sick human being, to continue to do this time and time again, continue to get caught, saying he۪s not going to do it again, gets caught again.۝ Bolling serves as one of the co-hosts of The Specialists,۝ a new program on the Fox News Channel. Previously, he served as one of the hosts of The Five۝ and as a fill-in host for O۪Reilly and Sean Hannity. After the network fired O۪Reilly last April, Fox News announced that Bolling would leave the The Five۝ and host another panel program at 5 p.m. with co-hosts Eboni Williams and Katherine Timpf. Bolling۪s star at the Fox Networks has risen in the past two years, in part because of his close relationship with and strong support of President Donald Trump. Bolling can often be seen aggressively defending Trump on the network, and his loyalty has been repaid. Over the past few years, Trump has tweeted praise and support for Bolling at least a dozen times, including support for his book in 2016. When The Specialists۝ premiered earlier this year, Bolling was granted an exclusive interview with Trump. Fox News recently renewed Bolling۪s contract. In a statement in June, Fox News co-president Suzanne Scott said that Bolling۪s  insight is valued, and we are pleased to have him at the network for many more years to come.۝ The multiyear extension ended speculation that he was going to accept a position in the Trump administration. In an interview with NJ.Com, Bolling said the Trump transition had floated the position of commerce secretary, but he said he would only consider joining as a senior adviser. In the interview, Bolling said he believed he had a future in politics :  When the lights go down on my TV career, the next step is running for Senate.۝ Follow Yashar  or send him a tip  on Twitter: @yashar"

Scaramucci was named communications director on July 21, a mere 10 days ago. Axios reports he resigned at the request of Gen. John Kelly, the new White House chief of staff. Mr. Scaramucci felt it was best to give Chief of Staff John Kelly a clean slate and the ability to build his own team,۝ a statement from the White House press secretary said Monday. We wish him all the best.۝ According to CBS and CNN, Scaramucci was escorted from White House grounds Monday. The resignation comes after a controversy-laden week for Scaramucci that included a profanity-laced tirade against other members of President Donald Trump۪s White House staff. His rant, published in The New Yorker, was mostly aimed at then-White House chief of staff Reince Priebus. ( Priebus resigned from his post last week and was replaced Monday morning by Kelly.) Scaramucci referred to Priebus as a fucking paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac.۝ Scaramucci also gave one of the more memorable quotes so far of the Trump administration during that interview, while arguing that he doesn۪t care for media attention. I۪m not Steve Bannon, I۪m not trying to suck my own cock,۝ he said. But that rant wasn۪t the only eyebrow-raising moment during his 10 days in the White House. Scaramucci brought on criticism after directing comments about hair and makeup at White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. He also reportedly received divorce papers from his wife, who gave birth to the couple۪s son while Scaramucci was with Trump last week. Michael Short, an aide in the White House press office, resigned last week because of pressure from Scaramucci, who had threatened to fire everybody۝ in order to stop leaks. Even his hire was laden with controversy. Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer reportedly submitted his resignation after learning Trump was giving Scaramucci a prominent role on the White House communications team. Scaramucci۪s short tenure followed that of Mike Dubke, who resigned in May after just three months as White House communications director. Just this morning, Trump assured his Twitter followers there is No WH chaos!۝ When asked about Scaramucci۪s departure during a White House press briefing Monday afternoon, Sanders confirmed that Scaramucci does not have a role at this time in the Trump administration,۝ saying Scaramucci and Kelly came to a mutual agreement۝ about Scaramucci۪s departure. She would not say if Scaramucci resigned or was fired. Of Kelly, Sanders said, all staff will report to him.۝ Sanders also commented on Scaramucci۪s interview with The New Yorker, saying Trump found the remarks inappropriate.۝ This was a breaking story that has been updated throughout."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-barcelona_us_5995bcd4e4b0d0d2cc851561","President Donald Trump issued an explosive statement against Radical Islamic Terror۝just hours after an attack in Barcelona, Spain, on Thursday left at least 13 people dead. Earlier this week, Trump said he needed to get all the facts۝ before singling out hate groups for condemnation after violent protests sparked by a white supremacist rally left one woman dead in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday. Trump initially posted a measured response to the incident in Barcelona: Less than an hour after his initial tweet, Trump followed up, implying the Barcelona attack was linked to Radical Islamic Terror۝: During the Republican presidential primary race, Trump told crowds a story ۥ a false one , according to historians ۥ about John Black Jack۝ Pershing, the Army general who commanded U.S. forces in World War I. According to Mother Jones ,Trump spoke of Pershing executing Muslim insurgents in the Philippines in the early 1900s with bullets dipped in pig۪s blood and eliminating a problem۝ for 25 years (unlike the 35 years mentioned in his tweet): He caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage_and he took the 50 terrorists and he took 50 men and dipped 50 bullets in pig۪s blood. You heard about that? He took 50 bullets and dipped them in pig۪s blood [which is considered haram]. And he has his men load up their rifles and he lined up the 50 people and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said, you go back to your people and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years there wasn۪t a problem. After telling that story, Trump claimedʉwe۪ve got to start getting tough and we۪ve got to start being vigilant and we۪ve got to start using our heads or we۪re not gonna have a country, folks.۝ As Time reported in 2016 , historians know of no evidence to support Trump۪s claim. The magazine quoted one saying it would have been out of character۝ for Pershing. Trump۪s comments on Barcelona came just hours after news broke of the carnage there, which police confirmed they were treating as a terrorist attack. The so-called Islamic State claimed responsibility for the assault via its Amaq news agency, but it۪s unclear to what degree the group۪s leadership was involved in planning it. White House chief of staff John Kelly briefed Trump on the matter Thursday afternoon. Trump۪s quick response sharply contrasts with his reactions to the violence in Charlottesville. Trump argued in his initial response on Saturday thatʉmany sides۝ were to blame for the tumult, which erupted amid a white supremacist protest against efforts to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. The president didn۪t explicitly condemn hate groups until Monday,two days after a car allegedly driven by a white supremacist plowed into a group of counterprotesters, killing a 32-year-old woman . In a rambling press conference Tuesday, Trump defended his initial statement, arguing he needed to get the facts۝ before making more definitive remarks against racist groups. I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct, not make a quick statement. The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement, but you don۪t make statements that direct unless you know the facts,۝ Trump said Tuesday. It takes a little while to get the facts. You still don۪t know the facts. It is a very, very important process to me. It is a very important statement. So I don۪t want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement. I want to know the facts.۝ Trump on Tuesday also again blamed both sides۝ for the clashes in Charlottesville. You had a group on one side that was bad. You had a group on the other side that was also very violent,۝ Trump said. Nobody wants to say that. I۪ll say it right now.۝ But Trump has been quick to cite radical Islamic terrorism۝ for attacks in the past. It took him less than a day to respond to terrorist attacks in Paris, Manchester, England, and London, the last of which he used as a reason to plug his proposal for a travel ban from several Muslim-majority countries. His rhetoric toward radical Islam۝ is often violent and sweeping, unlike his comments on the white supremacist and racist groups who gathered for the rally in Charlottesville,which Trump claimed had some  fine people .۝ As Vox has pointed out, Trump has been generally slow to respond to violent incidents where Muslims are the victims. Trump also has claimed he can predict۝ terrorism , saying he can feel it.۝ After a gunman who claimed allegiance to the Islamic State attacked a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in June 2016, killing 49 and wounding scores more, Trump bragged about  being right on radical Islamic terrorism .۝"
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steve-bannon-out_us_597242dfe4b09e5f6ccf1ac8","Steve Bannon , a senior adviser to the president who was largely credited with shaping the strategy that got Donald Trump to the White House, is out from his role as the president۪s chief strategist. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said Bannon and Chief of Staff John Kelly agreed Friday would be his last day. We are grateful for his service and wish him the best,۝ Sanders said in a statement. The details of Bannon۪s departure remain unclear. The New York Times reported Trump had decided to remove Bannon, but also that a source close to Bannon said the adviser had submitted his resignation on Aug. 7 to be effective Aug. 14. MSNBC ۪s Stephanie Ruhle also tweeted Bannon is out.۝ CNN۪s Jim Acosta and Axios۪ Jonathan Swan both tweeted Bannon had been fired. Vanity Fair۪s Gabriel Sherman tweeted that Bannon was expected to return to Breitbart News , the site espousing white nationalist views that he led before joining Trump۪s president campaign. Charlie Spiering, Breitbart۪s White House correspondent, said Bannon had returned immediately and chaired an editorial meeting on Friday. Bannon told Bloomberg Businessweek that he is going to fight for Trump against his opponents ۥ on Capitol Hill, in the media, and in corporate America.۝ If there۪s any confusion out there, let me clear it up: I۪m leaving the White House and going to war,۝ he told the outlet. A source close to Bannon told The Atlantic۪s Rosie Gray that Bannon is now fully unchained.۝ Bannon۪s departure comes amid a recent wave of White House staffing shakeups and turmoil. According to Axios , Trump believed that Bannon was behind recent leaks to the press. The president has made stopping leaks a top priority. Backlash over Trump۪s response to white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia ,may have also led to the departure.Former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci on Sunday blamed Trump۪s failure to directly call out far-right groups on Bannon. Scaramucci himself was fired after just 10 days on the job , after he forced out then-chief of staff Reince Priebus . Both Bannon and Priebus had strongly objected to Scaramucci۪s hiring, and former press secretary Sean Spicer resigned over it . In a statement, the Democratic National Committee said Bannon۪s departure would mean there is one less white supremacist in the White House, but that doesn۪t change the man sitting behind the Resolute desk.۝ Donald Trump has spent decades fueling hate in communities, including his recent attempts to divide our country and give a voice to white supremacists,۝ the group said in a statement. Bannon, who left Breitbart to run Trump۪s campaign in August 2016, pushed Trump to be loyal to the populist base that got him elected. He was a conservative force in the West Wing who helped draft Trump۪s controversial ban on travel and immigration from several Muslim-majority countries. Bannon was once considered one of the most influential members of Trump۪s inner circle, but he has receded from public view in recent months. After his feud with Jared Kushner, Trump۪s son-in-law, became public earlier this year, Trump urged the two to work it out. Politico also reported Trump was upset over a new book highlighting the importance of Bannon۪s role in Trump۪s presidential campaign. Bannon also gave a bizarre interview this week to The American Prospect, a progressive publication, calling white supremacists a collection of clowns۝ and contradicted Trump۪s military threats to North Korea. In April, when Bannon and Kushner feuded, Trump downplayed Bannon۪s role during his presidential campaign, portraying him as someone who took over in the homestretch and whom he didn۪t know well . Bannon once pledged to fight for the  deconstruction of the administrative state .۝He long assailed establishment Republicans and reportedly called House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) a limp-dick motherfucker۝ when there was talk of pushing Ryan to challenge Trump۪s claim to the Republican nomination. Progressives long protested Bannon۪s elevation to his role as Trump۪s chief strategist, citing his offensive views . Following Trump۪s apparent refusal to denounce the white nationalist protesters in Charlottesville, they renewed their calls to fire Bannon.۝ Leaders of the congressional black, Asian, Hispanic and progressive caucuses also had sent a letter to the White House demanding the dismissal of Bannon along with aides Stephen Miller and Sebastian Gorka, saying their presence in the White House emboldened white supremacists across the country. The letter came after Trump faced criticism for initially condemning all sides۝ after the violent protests in Charlottesville. Americans deserve to know that white nationalists, white supremacists, and neo-Nazis are not in a position to influence U.S. policy,۝ the letter said. That is why we continue to find Steve Bannon۪s presence in your administration incredibly alarming and dangerous to our nation and the world, and once again, we urge you to immediately remove Steve Bannon from the White House altogether. As you know, Mr. Bannon is the co-founder of the white nationalist, alt-right۪ website, Breitbart News. Under his direction and approval, this site published blatantly bigoted rhetoric about women, Muslims, and other minorities. It is no wonder that white nationalist groups, such as the KKK, have praised Mr. Bannon۪s extreme political statements.۝ This article has been updated with more details about Bannon۪s departure from the White House and return to Breitbart."

Linda Tripp is the woman who befriended White House intern Monica Lewinsky and secretly recorded some of their conversations in an attempt to get dirt on Lewinsky۪s affair with then-President Bill Clinton . Scaramucci made the comparison between Lizza and Tripp because he claimed the reporter taped their call without telling him.

The acrimony first surfaced during the presidential transition. The two men had been cordial before then. They met six years ago, when Scaramucci was a fundraiser for presidential candidate Mitt Romney and Priebus was chair of the Republican National Committee. They interacted peaceably during Donald Trump ۪s campaign as Scaramucci made the rounds on television and at donor events. After Trump۪s victory, Priebus was named chief of staff, and Scaramucci, according to someone close to the transition, was assured that he was also in line for a big position within the administration. (Sources for this story requested anonymity to discuss the details of sensitive conversations.) While preparing for his move into government, Scaramucci struck a deal  which is still under regulatory scrutiny  to sell his stake in his hedge fund, SkyBridge Capital, to Chinese conglomerate HNA Group and another company. He assumed that he۪d be put in charge of the public liaison office, a job that Valerie Jarrett held in the Obama administration. He had it all mapped out, according to the White House adviser. He identified 2,500 influential business leaders across the United States and had come up with a clever name for them: Trump Team 2,500. He believed these people would help pressure Congress into supporting the president۪s agenda. But Scaramucci۪s plans were foiled in early January. That۪s when Priebus, according to a confidant of both Scaramucci and the president, told Trump, He played you.۝ How۪s that?۝ Trump asked Priebus, according to the same source, who has spoken to several people within the White House about the conversation. Priebus then told Trump that he felt Scaramucci had been offered too much for SkyBridge by HNA Group. The deal, he implied, smelled bad  as if the Chinese might expect favors from within the administration for that inflated price. The source also said that Priebus mentioned there was email traffic between Scaramucci and the Chinese proving this. The White House rejected this version of events and declined to make Priebus available for comment. Ultimately, Scaramucci was not offered the job. But he didn۪t give up. He asked Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner to get him in the door. According to two people familiar with the conversation, Kushner assured him that he didn۪t think Scaramucci was shady,۝ adding, But it۪s not what I think that matters.۝ Priebus had already planted the seed of doubt in Trump۪s mind . Scaramucci then tried presidential adviser Steve Bannon, who, according to those same two people, explained that he was too busy attempting to save the job of another adviser, Stephen Miller, to spend time or capital trying to help Scaramucci. A friend of Scaramucci۪s said he complained that some in the White House assumed his finances were suspect because he۪s of Italian descent. Scaramucci also took Priebus۪ behavior as a sign that Priebus was feeling insecure about his own job. I will try things the Washington way first,۝ Trump had told his inner circle when he first named Priebus chief of staff, according to the confidant of Scaramucci and Trump. The implication was clear: If the Washington way did not work, then the New York real estate way would take over. Finally, Scaramucci went to Keith Schiller, the president۪s longtime bodyguard. He asked Schiller to put him on the phone with Trump so that he could lodge his complaints directly. The president listened, according to their mutual friend, and said he would find a position for Scaramucci as soon as he could. In June, Scaramucci was appointed to be senior vice president and chief strategy officer of the Export-Import Bank. But the Priebus incident lingered in his mind. So, on July 11, when Donald Trump Jr. found himself in trouble for holding a meeting with several people close to the Russian government the previous summer, Scaramucci sensed an opportunity. According to the mutual friend, Scaramucci told everyone he spoke to that day, including the president, that he was sure the person who divulged details of the meeting was Priebus. Scaramucci made the case  not necessarily backed by evidence  that with all the leaks targeting the administration, it was odd that only a few had hit Priebus directly. Ten days later, Scaramucci was named the new White House communications director. The announcement noted that he would be reporting directly to the president  an unusual move that leapfrogged over the chief of staff. Priebus balked, insisting that Scaramucci report to him. But Trump overrode his chief of staff. Not only was the hedge fund manager who had known Trump for 21 years officially in charge of the press shop, but he was also set to oversee the reorganization of the White House. Scaramucci seemed to have his revenge. At least until Thursday evening. In an interview with The New Yorker , Scaramucci called Priebus a fucking paranoid schizophrenic۝ and explained how he, unlike Bannon, is not trying to suck my own cock.۝ Now, Scaramucci۪s future at the White House is less clear, even if Trump reportedly  loved ۝ the outburst. Two sources close to the president said the very traits that have so endeared Scaramucci to Trump  tenacity, frankness, limitless swagger  could end up endangering his new job if he continues to steal news cycles from the president. But those same sources said he۪s safe for now. Mark my words: Anthony will ultimately be an exceptionally good communications director,۝ said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump aide who still talks to the president. His career proves he۪s a master communicator. I hope he keeps his perfect chin up.۝ On Friday, the news broke that Priebus had been ousted as chief of staff. The story has been updated to remove a reference to a lawyer whom Scaramucci and Kushner share, as Scaramucci hired that attorney before he was first turned down for a job in the administration."

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-falsehoods-tax-cuts_us_5a3d72a1e4b06d1621b44a8c","WASHINGTON  President Donald Trump ۪s falsehood-rich style appears to have come back to bite him as he brags about his only major legislative accomplishment. Having passed tax cuts that provide modest help to most Americans, Trump and GOP leaders are finding that most Americans just don۪t believe it. A CNN poll earlier this month found that only 21 percent of respondents believed they would be better off under the tax plan, while 37 percent believed they would be worse off. Another 36 percent thought they would not be affected much either way. In reality  at least until the individual tax cuts expire at the end of 2025  the vast majority of families will benefit from the cuts, although not necessarily that much for the typical middle-income family. While the overall benefits skew toward the wealthy because of the dramatic 40-percent reduction in the corporate income tax rate, some 80 percent of taxpayers will see a tax reduction next year, according to the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, while 5 percent will get a tax increase and the remainder will see little difference. That disconnect is not surprising to Neil Newhouse, a prominent Republican pollster. The data you۪re seeing is measuring voter reaction to the Trump-GOP tax plan, and neither of those brands is scoring particularly well right now,۝ Newhouse said. Voters are responding less to what۪s actually in the tax plan and more to who۪s taking credit for it.۝ Trump ۥ as he has done regularly whenever confronted with news he does not like ۥ blamed the media for the plan۪s unpopularity. The Massive Tax Cuts, which the Fake News Media is desperate to write badly about so as to please their Democrat bosses, will soon be kicking in and will speak for themselves,۝ the president tweeted on Thursday. Companies are already making big payments to workers. Dems want to raise taxes, hate these big Cuts!۝ Many Republicans agree with Trump that the news media have emphasized how much the tax plan will benefit the wealthy  including Trump himself  but failed to point out that the typical middle-class family would also benefit by about $78 per month. Republicans are correct to assume that the bill will become more popular when people see it in their paychecks,۝ said Rory Cooper, once a top aide to former Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. But Cooper and others acknowledge that some of the public۪s skepticism is based on Trump۪s apparent inability or unwillingness to communicate truthfully  a trait that has extended to the tax cut bill as well. On Wednesday, for instance, on a day that Trump might have simply stated the facts about the bill۪s final passage and the benefits it contained, he instead decided to embellish, so that the first three statements he made about the bill were all untrue. Trump claimed that tax legislation really hasn۪t been done۝ before  which was false. He then claimed that the bill was the largest tax cut in the history of our country۝  which was also false. And then he claimed that the tax cuts for individuals totaled $3.2 trillion  which is not remotely close to true. The bill cuts taxes in all by about $1.8 trillion over 10 years, of which $1.2 trillion goes to individuals and households. Completely unnecessary,۝ said Republican political consultant Rick Tyler about Trump۪s string of falsehoods. He thinks that just because he says something, people will believe it. He probably believes it. Because he exhibits all the symptoms of a pathological liar.۝ Tyler, like most Republicans, supports the tax cuts. He argues that the wealthy pay most of the federal taxes that are collected, so it۪s not unreasonable to see them benefit the most from a tax cut. I think the administration and the Republicans made a communications error by saying it۪s going to be a huge break for the middle class,۝ Tyler said, adding that families will be able to make their own decision about the law once they start seeing changes in their paychecks. But Republicans counting on the tax cuts to give them a big political boost come next Election Day may be in for a disappointment. President George W. Bush۪s 2001 tax cuts were larger than the ones just passed, and even included $600 rebate۝ checks mailed to taxpayers. Yet just two years later, only 19 percent of Americans believed their taxes had gone down, while 32 percent believed their taxes had risen. President Barack Obama and a Democratic Congress passed a payroll tax cut in 2010 that saved the typical family $1,000 through reduced payroll deductions. Voters again did not seem to notice it, and believed their taxes had gone up. Whether Trump۪s tax cuts are viewed the same way remains to be seen, said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll. Does this help him or not? We۪re going to find out,۝ Brown said. If people start seeing their paychecks start getting bigger, and they make the connection between their paychecks and Trump۪s policies, that would be good for Trump.۝"

Frustrated by the silence from Netflix on the Masterson issue, she said she hoped he could provide some direction. She said she didn۪t intend to identify herself as an alleged victim until Yeatman said higher-ups at Netflix didn۪t believe Masterson۪s accusers. Victim B noted that she had seen Yeatman in the past at other soccer games and that her husband knew him from previous games. Lilly Yeatman, the wife of Andy Yeatman, sent an email to the husband of Victim B after this piece was initially published, saying Victim B has really done a terrible thing to a great guy۝ and that her husband is terribly sad and heartbroken for any woman who has been hurt or mistreated.۝ The email, which Victim B provided to HuffPost, was sent from Lilly Yeatman۪s professional email address at Disney. Neither Disney nor Lilly Yeatman immediately responded to a request for comment. Masterson has been the subject of an almost year-long investigation conducted by the LAPD and the Los Angeles County District Attorney۪s Office. Four women have accused Masterson of violently raping them in the early 2000s . They have told law enforcement that they believe Masterson spiked their drinks with something that led them to black out before and during the alleged rapes. Masterson has denied all allegations of rape and said that the encounters in question were consensual. An attorney for the actor denied that Masterson ever placed any drugs in someone else۪s drink and said that as a Scientologist, Masterson has a strict anti-drug policy for himself and for guests in his home. Netflix has known about the accusations since at least March, when journalist Tony Ortega revealed that the LAPD had an active investigation into multiple allegations of rape against the actor. Three of the women who have accused Masterson were members of the Church of Scientology at the time they say they were raped. Church doctrine says that contacting law enforcement to report another Scientologist is a high crime and will lead to being declared a suppressive person ۥ meaning that person will be shunned from the church, and their friends and family members who are church members must stop speaking to them. Despite that edict, Victim B filed a police report against Masterson in 2004. But the case was quickly thwarted when dozens of Scientologists filed affidavits with the LAPD claiming that Victim B wasn۪t telling the truth. The LAPD officially reopened the case against Masterson in January, and referred it to the district attorney in April. Sources in the police department and district attorney۪s office have described the evidence against Masterson as compelling۝ and overwhelming.۝ This article has been updated with details from Lilly Yeatman۪s email to the husband of Victim B.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/most-radical-provisions-gop-tax-bill_us_5a230f19e4b03c44072df14c","The nearly 500-page overhaul of the tax code that Republicans rammed through the Senate early Saturday morning gave lawmakers and experts little more than a moment۪s notice to pore over the law۪s myriad changes. But one thing is clear: The bill is filled with perks for America۪s wealthiest individuals and largest corporations, many of them paid for by closing loopholes that benefit middle-class people. By 2027, the top one-fifth of earners would receive 90 percent of the tax bill۪s benefits, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Here are some of the legislation۪s most outrageous components ۥ from giveaways for the super-rich to carve-outs for private schools. Dramatically reducing the corporate tax rate. The centerpiece of the Republican tax bill is its slashing of the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. Republicans claim this is necessary to restore American competitiveness, noting that, on paper at least, the United States has one of the highest corporate rates in the developed world. However, many large corporations are able to take advantage of deductions and loopholes that allow them to register profits overseas. This means that in practice, the average effective corporate tax rate on profit from new investments in the U.S. is 24 percent ۥ just a shade higher than the G-7 average of 21 percent. There are, of course, proponents of a lower corporate tax rate in both major political parties. Former President Barack Obama , for example, proposed lowering the top corporate rate to 28 percent as part of a revenue-neutral, comprehensive tax reform package. But without major changes in the way corporations do business,a big corporate tax cut is not actually likely to result in more job creation and higher wages. Instead, it is just a windfall for the corporate executive suite that is bound to exacerbate income inequality. That۪s because corporate incentives are such that executives and their boards are rewarded for how much they maximize quarterly returns for big investors , not how much they invest in the long-term growth of their companies ۥ let alone how they treat their workers. As a result, Fortune 500 CEOs and their fellow decision-makers are just as likely to spend the extra cash they get from this massive tax cut on dividends and stock buybacks, rather than expanding their workforces. They have even said as much . Creating a big new tax deduction for private school tuition. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) succeeded in adding an amendment to the final bill that would expand tax-exempt 529 college savings plans to parents saving for K-12 private school tuition, as well as expenses associated with home schooling. Technically the expanded savings accounts would allow parents to amass tax-free savings for public school education as well, but it is not at all clear what major costs are incurred from a public school education. And there are no exceptions to the types of schooling eligible for the tax break, meaning that the tax code is now almost certain to subsidize private religious education. By expanding choice for parents and opportunities for children, we have prioritized the education of the next generation of Americans, allowing families to save and prepare for their children۪s future educational expenses,۝ Cruz said in a statement about the amendment۪s passage. Although the tax benefit is sure to save some families money, the ballooning cost of private elementary and secondary school makes it unlikely that it will increase access to private school for middle- and low-income kids. Average annual tuition at non-sectarian private elementary schools rose from $4,120 in 1979 to $22,611 in 2011, according to a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research released in July. It۪s no surprise then that in 2013, 26 percent of families in urban area with incomes in the 90th income percentile sent their kids to private school, compared to just 7 percent of families in the 50th percentile, according to NBER. In 1968, by contrast, the study said, there was a gap of just 5 percentage points in the two income groups۪ respective rates of private school enrollment. Encouraging corporations to automate ۥ without any help for displaced workers. A provision of the tax bill would allow companies to deduct from their taxable income the entire cost of certain kinds of business investments that were previously only eligible for a 50 percent deduction. Traditionally, manufacturing firms and other infrastructure-heavy companies took advantage of the deduction to buy new factory equipment. But the increase in the deduction comes at a time when corporations are investing in automation of their production facilities through the use of robots and artificial intelligence technology, noted Robert Kovacev, a corporate tax attorney for the Steptoe & Johnson law firm in Washington, D.C. It۪s going to accelerate spending, basically, on robots that could displace workers,۝ Kovacev told HuffPost. Kovacev is supportive of the deduction, because automation is likely to increase productivity ۥ defined as the amount of economic output generated per work-hour. And many experts maintain that, over the long run, this type of technological disruption is a net job creator. That is likely to serve as cold comfort, however, for the mostly blue-collar workers displaced by automation in the short term. And Congress chose to speed up the automation process without any companion measures to offset the fallout for affected workers. It would be a good idea to pair this with a tax incentive to encourage companies either to employ more human workers or retrain them for jobs in the new economy,۝ Kovacev said. Some progressive lawmakers have other ideas about how to address the harm caused by automation. For example, San Francisco County Supervisor Jane Kim has explored the idea of implementing a ۝ robot tax ۝ on companies for every robot they employ to perform a job previously done by humans. The revenue raised by the tax would fund the retraining of displaced workers. Setting the stage for cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. The Republican tax bill will add $1 trillion to the national debt over a 10-year period, according to the most recent estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan congressional tax analysis body. The lack of measures to pay for the tax cuts is why Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) decided to vote against the final Senate bill, becoming the only Republican to do so. Many progressive economists believe the national debt is not a major challenge at this juncture. Interest rates on Treasury bonds remain low by historical standards. Still, once Republicans pass their budget-busting tax cuts, they frequently stoke debt fears to justify taking an ax to federal spending. They did it when Obama took office despite their overwhelming support for former President George W. Bush۪s tax cuts, and they have already indicated they plan to do it again. This time, though, they are coming for the three largest social insurance programs ۥ Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) was one of several Republican lawmakers to explicitly say that following the changes to the tax code, the next priority would be scaling back so-called entitlement۝ spending. You also have to bring spending under control. And not discretionary spending. That isn۪t the driver of our debt,۝ Rubio said last week . The driver of our debt is the structure of Social Security and Medicare for future beneficiaries.۝ Rejecting a proposal to expand a tax credit for families with children in order to reduce the corporate tax rate even more. Rubio and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) wanted to add an amendment to the tax bill that would have modestly expanded the Child Tax Credit, which is effectively a cash benefit for low-income working families with children. The latest version of the change would have provided some 10 million families with about $75 more per year , according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. To pay for the roughly $87 billion price of expanding the tax credit, Rubio and Lee proposed reducing the top corporate tax rate to just under 21 percent, rather than the 20 percent threshold that President Donald Trump and GOP leaders were seeking. The amendment collapsed in a 71-29 vote with just 20 Republicans and nine Democrats voting for it. Most Republicans objected to the amendment on the grounds that the corporate rate needed to drop to 20 percent. Democrats declined to rally behind it, because they argued that the tax credit was far too small to provide meaningful help to vulnerable people and that GOP leaders would ultimately strip it out in conference committee regardless. All but eliminating the estate tax for the country۪s wealthiest households. Under the Senate bill, an even tinier sliver of households in the country would be subject to the estate tax levied on the assets that ultra-rich individuals leave to their heirs when they die. Currently, $11 million in assets are exempt from the estate tax, ensuring that it falls on just 0.2 percent of American households with taxable assets. While the top statutory estate tax rate is 40 percent, the average effective rate paid by families subject to the tax is about 17 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center . The tax nonetheless serves as a major source of revenue for the federal government and achieves the additional goal of modestly limiting intergenerational wealth transfers, which some experts believe undermine meritocracy and social mobility. The Senate bill would double the estate tax exemption to $22 million for couples, eliminating the tax entirely for half the estates that currently pay it, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities . Those households still subject to the tax would get a $4.4 million tax cut, which CBPP points out would be enough to provide Pell grants to fund college tuition for 1,100 low- and moderate-income students. The bill Republicans passed in the House gets rid of the estate tax entirely over time."

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on Saturday, after the lawmaker warned that the storm presented a critical moment for the president, citing the poor response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 by then-President George W. Bush۪s administration. Later on Sunday evening, Trump issued another, similar tweet thanking no one in particular. Although Hurricane Harvey has been downgraded to a tropical storm, heavy rainfall from it is expected to last for days and the Houston area braced for the prospect of catastrophic flooding . The National Weather Service reported at least five fatalities in the region. According to Trump۪s weekend schedule, he has been monitoring the storm from his Camp David retreat, receiving regular updates from authorities.But it was clear from his tweets that Trump۪s priorities were not entirely on the disaster. On Sunday, Trump announced via Twitter that he would visit Texas as soon as that trip can be made without causing disruption.۝Yet he immediately tweeted that he would also visit Missouri. He bragged that Missouri is a wonderful state...that I won by a lot۝ in the 2016 election, and he politicized the visit by predicting that a Republican would defeat its Democratic U.S. senator, Claire McCaskill, who is up for re-election next year. Among Trump۪s other missives on Sunday morning: reiterating that Mexico would provide reimbursements for his long-promised border wall and charging that Mexico and Canada are being very difficult۝ in negotiations to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement. He also asserted that NAFTA was the worst trade deal ever made۝. He even found time to plug a book by ardent supporter David Clarke, the sheriff of Milwaukee County who runs a jail where the deaths last year of four persons ۥ including a newborn ۥ have raised concerns about its operations. On Friday evening, while Hurricane Harvey was about to make landfall, Trump used the opportunity to unleash a storm of other news , spurring questions about whether he deliberately timed the actions to keep the spotlight off them. He quietly issued a memo outlining guidance on enforcing his decision to ban transgender people from serving in the military. He also pardoned Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff who had been found in contempt of court for violating a judge۪s order stemming from a racial profiling case.

As seen in the footage below, a man in a blue sleeveless shirt, a green vest and a bandana on his head pulls out a gun and aims it at a counterprotester, who is off camera and appears to be holding a makeshift lit torch. The first man appears to yell a racial slur at the black man, then fires the gun toward the ground in the direction of the counterprotesters. The shooter then leaves the scene by joining a line of white supremacist protesters and walking past law enforcement officers, who were standing behind metal barricades about 10 feet away . Police arrested Richard Wilson Preston, 52, in connection with the incident in the video above,the Daily Progress reported on Saturday. Wilson was charged with discharging a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school during the so-called Unite The Right۝ rally on Aug. 12. He is in custody in Towson, Maryland.

Make no mistake it۪s an all-out attack on equal pay,۝ Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women۪s Law Center, said in a statement on Tuesday. Today۪s action sends a clear message to employers,۝ Graves added. If you want to ignore pay inequities and sweep them under the rug, this Administration has your back.۝ They also took aim at the president۪s eldest daughter for betraying her purported commitment to working women. For somebody who has long held herself out as a champion for women and for gender equality, it۪s really disappointing,۝ Vicki Shabo, vice president for workplace policy and strategy at the National Partnership for Women and Families, told HuffPost on Wednesday. [This] spits in the eye of gender equality and in the eyes of women and people of color who are so often paid less and do not know.۝ On average, women in the U.S. are paid 80 cents for every dollar men earn, according to federal data. The pay gap for women of color is even worse. Hispanic women earn 54 cents on the dollar, while black women make 63 cents.Even when researchers analyze the data and account for differences in education and time spent in the labor force, the wage gap persists. Interestingly, Ivanka Trump۪s book, a bland treatise called Women Who Work , mentions the term equal pay۝ only once, focusing more on individual moves women can make to achieve success in the workplace. When you۪re passionate and work hard you can achieve great things,۝ she writes. But even when a woman is going full-steam ahead at work, she may not realize that her male peers are out-earning her. After 19 years as a manager at a Goodyear plant in Alabama, Lilly Ledbetter famously found out she had been making less than her male colleagues after someone sent her an anonymous note. Her lawsuit led to the passage of equal pay legislation in 2009. Employers are now required to report information about the race, ethnicity and gender of their employees. Starting a few years ago, tech companies have made their Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reports public, which has led to a painful ۥ but fruitful ۥ discussion about the lack of women in the tech industry. It۪s easy to imagine how pay data would۪ve advanced the conversation even further and made it easier for federal regulators to spot patterns of discrimination. Having pay data in summary form will help us identify patterns that may warrant further investigation,۝ the former chairwoman of the EEOC said last year at a conference in New York. In the past, she said, we۪d learn about a pay-discrimination problem because someone saw a piece of paper left on a copy machine or someone was complaining about their salary to co-workers.۝ Companies with more than 100 workers were set to receive a new form to report the data in September and start providing more detailed information to the EEOC in 2018. Most employers were already preparing to file this data, according to Shabo. Indeed, in recent years, activist shareholders have been pressuring public companies to report data ۥ a few companies, including Apple and Amazon, have started opening up about gender and pay. Stopping the Obama administration provision from going into effect was the result of an orchestrated effort by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the federal contractors business lobby and anti-worker and anti-regulatory senators on the Hill, Shabo said. It۪s even more disappointing because the provision already represented a compromised effort, she added. It wasn۪t as comprehensive or as detailed as we would۪ve liked. This was something that was put together with the ease and efficiency of the employer community in mind.۝ Still, there had been rumors since January that this would happen, and it۪s hard to be surprised that the White House, which has been openly hostile to women۪s rights ۥ by rolling back provisions on contraception and reinstating harsh restrictions on women۪s health around the world ۥ would make such a move. This is not a woman- or family-friendly administration,۝ Shabo said."
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-lawyer-emails-mueller_us_5a35f056e4b0ff955ad384dd","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An organization established for U.S. President Donald Trump۪s transition to the White House a year ago said on Saturday that the special counsel investigating allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 election had obtained tens of thousands of emails unlawfully. Kory Langhofer, counsel to the transition team known as Trump for America, Inc., wrote a letter to congressional committees to say Special Counsel Robert Mueller۪s team had improperly received the emails from the General Services Administration, a government agency. Career staff members at the agency unlawfully produced TFA۪s private materials, including privileged communications, to the Special Counsel۪s Office,۝ according to the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. It said the materials included tens of thousands of emails.۝ Trump۪s transition team used facilities of the GSA, which helps manage the U.S. government bureaucracy, in the period between the Republican۪s November presidential election victory and his inauguration in January. The Trump team۪s accusation adds to the growing friction between the president۪s supporters and Mueller۪s office as it investigates whether Russia interfered in the election and if Trump or anyone on his team colluded with Moscow. Asked for comment, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said: We continue to cooperate fully with the special counsel and expect this process to wrap up soon.۝ The GSA and officials at the special counsel۪s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Norm Eisen, who served on former President Barack Obama۪s transition team,responded on Twitter to the letter, sayingʉthere is NO expectation of privacy in your transition emails.۝ Democrats say there is a wide-ranging effort by the president۪s allies on Capitol Hill and in some media outlets to discredit Mueller۪s investigation. Trump himself has loudly declared Mueller۪s effort a waste of time. There is absolutely no collusion. That has been proven,۝ Trump told reporters on Friday. Russia denies interfering in the election. On Friday, Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said he fears the committee۪s Republican majority intends to close its investigation of the topic prematurely. Some Republicans have argued that Mueller is biased against Trump and should be fired. The letter was sent to the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, and the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. It asked for Congress to act immediately to protect future presidential transitions from having their private records misappropriated by government agencies, particularly in the context of sensitive investigations intersecting with political motives.۝ The letter said Mueller۪s office obtained the emails despite the fact that it was aware the GSA did not own or control the records. It said the special counsel۪s office has extensively used the materials in question, including portions that are susceptible to claims of privilege۝ without notifying the Trump for America team. On the transition team were a number of aides who were later caught up in Mueller۪s investigation, such as former national security adviser Michael Flynn who pleaded guilty this month to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia. Langhofer, the Trump transition team lawyer, wrote in his letter that the GSA۪s transfer of materials was discovered on Dec. 12 and 13. The FBI had requested the materials from GSA staff last Aug. 23, asking for copies of the emails, laptops, cell phones and other materials associated with nine members of the Trump transition team response for national security and policy matters, the letter said. On Aug. 30, the FBI requested the materials of four additional senior members of the Trump transition team, it said. Langhofer argued that while such transition teams are involved in executive functions, they are considered private, nonprofit organizations whose records are private and not subject to presidential records laws.

At one point a car plowed into an anti-racist group amid clashes between white supremacist activists, some armed, and anti-fascist protesters. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) declared a state of emergency on Saturday afternoon. President Donald Trump blamed many sides۝ for the unrest. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a federal investigation into the violence at the rally. The FBI and the U.S. Attorney۪s Office for the Western District of Virginia have also launched a civil rights investigation into the fatal car crash. CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. ۥ Thousands of white supremacists and armed militia groups faced off with counter-protesters during a violent and chaotic rally that raged for hours in this Virginia city on Saturday, resulting in the deaths of at least three people. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), who declared a state of emergency Saturday afternoon, condemned the violence during a press conference that evening, sending a message to the white supremacists. Our message is plain and simple: Go home. You are not wanted in this great commonwealth,۝ he said. Shame on you.۝ Please go home and never come back. Take your hatred, and take your bigotry,۝ McAuliffe added. Charlottesville Police Chief Al Thomas said 35 people were treated for injuries by city personnel on Saturday, with injuries ranging from minor to life-threatening. Three people died Saturday, including a 32-year-old woman who was hit by a car that plowed into a group of counter-demonstrators and two others who perished in a helicopter crash near the protests. James Alex Fields Jr., 20, was arrested in connection with the car incident. He was charged with one count of second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of failing to stop at an accident resulting in a death, police Col. Martin Kumer told HuffPost. It was just terrifying,۝ said 23-year-old Thomas Pilnik, a Charlottesville resident who witnessed the crash.ʉI remember people flying into me, telling me to run and get out of the way and watching people fly like they were just bowling pins.۝ As of 10 p.m. Eastern on Saturday , police had made three other arrests related to the rally: You came here today to hurt people and you did hurt people,۝ McAuliffe said at Saturday۪s press conference. Groups in Charlottesville beat each other with flagpoles and bats, threw punches, chanted slogans and used chemical sprays on each other at a downtown park. Some reporters covering the event were doused in raw sewage. There was a cloud,۝ said a witness, who asked not to be named. Things were flying. Most people managed to get out of the way.۝ Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Saturday night that U.S. Attorney Rick Mountcastle has opened a federal investigation into the violence at the rally, with the full support of the Justice Department. The U.S.attorney۪s office and regional FBI office also announced a civil rights investigation into the circumstances surrounding the deadly car crash. The violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice,۝ Sessions said in a statement. When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated.۝ The Unite the Right۝ rally was promoted by white nationalist Richard Spencer and drew several different groups, including activists from the so-called alt-right,۝ Nazis, Ku Klux Klan members and other white supremacists, some of whom dressed in militia uniforms and were openly carrying long guns. Counter-demonstrators and anti-fascist groups also attended. After demonstrations got heated Friday night, tensions were running high even before the rally officially began at noon, with members of the alt-right۝ chanting the Nazi phrase Blood and soil!۝ and White lives matter!۝ as they marched toward Emancipation Park. With Confederate flags and Nazi memorabilia on full display, they also chanted Fuck you faggots!۝ James Allsup, who was in Charlottesville for the Unite the Right۝ rally, told Mediaite that white people are tired of being told by the cosmopolitan elites that we are the problem.۝ This is the biggest racist rally in recent memory,۝ a 23-year-old anti-fascist from Michigan, who wouldn۪t give his name, told HuffPost. And we are all out here opposing these motherfuckers and trying to get a temperature check where the right is ۥ where the far right is at ۥ and how they۪re organizing, and where we can apply radical strategies to defeat fascism.۝ Early Saturday, McAuliffe asked on Twitter for a stop to the violence. As violence among the groups grew on Saturday morning, some fled the scene, while others coughed and cried from the chemical sprays. Two fences and a line of cops helped separate the opposing groups, though police did not immediately intervene in the violence. Police donned riot gear as fights escalated. Meanwhile, hundreds more white supremacists joined in the fray through the afternoon, making their way under a banner hung by the city that read Diversity makes us stronger.۝ Those standing on the sidelines were baffled as to why police weren۪t immediately stopping the skirmishes. If this were Ferguson, riot gear, tear gas, everything would have been used,۝ said Anthony Bennett, a pastor from Connecticut, referring to the Missouri town where protests broke out in August 2014 after Darren Wilson, at the time a police officer, shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager. There۪s a different standard here in Charlottesville.۝ Unidentified militia members brandishing guns also showed up at the scene. Just minutes before the planned noon rally was set to begin, police threatened arrest for  unlawful assembly .۝Thousands of people began to disperse, but it wasn۪t immediately clear where they were going. Eventually, arrests began. Late Friday night, a white nationalist march at the University of Virginia campus painted a sobering picture of what was to come. A torch-bearing procession of hundreds that included Spencer, at least one man wearing a Nazi SS T-shirt and another carrying a bat,ended with a clash at the campus rotunda where a Thomas Jefferson statue stands. Spencer admitted on Twitter that a group surrounded counter-protesters at the statue. Counter-protesters told HuffPost that some among their ranks were then hit with some type of irritant Friday night ۥ they claim it was Mace, unleashed by the white supremacists.Protesters on the fringe left, who come to these events to battle the fringe right, often try to hide their identities for fear of retaliation. Some counter-protesters threatened a HuffPost reporter with a gun when he attempted to photograph, from a distance, those recovering from the irritant. Don۪t make me use my gun on you,۝ a woman said, grabbing a holster on her hip. Punches and torches were thrown during the fracas, but local police eventually dispersed the crowds. President Donald Trump did little to denounce the white supremacists, instead saying Saturday that many sides۝ were responsible for the violence. We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides ۥ on many sides,۝ Trump said at a ceremony for the signing of a bill to reform the Veterans Affairs health care system. It۪s been going on for a long time in our country, not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama. It۪s been going on for a long, long time.۝ Comments from state and local officials addressed the racism more directly. Charlottesville Mayor Michael Signer spoke out against the white supremacists who gathered in his city. They do not agree with the rules of democracy and they are on the losing side of history,۝ he said during a press conference Saturday evening. McAuliffe spoke directly to white supremacists during the press conference, reminding them that we are a nation of immigrants.۝ McAuliffe said he spoke to Trump on Saturday and told the president he۪d be willing to work together, despite their differences, to help prevent this kind of violence in the future. There has got to be a movement in this country to bring people together,۝ McAuliffe said. The rally Saturday was thinly disguised on Facebook as an event in support of the statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee downtown, which is slated for removal as the city works to respect diverse voices in its telling of American history. It۪s part of a nationwide effort to remove Confederate monuments from public property. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, more than 60 Confederate symbols have been removed from city- and state-owned land across the U.S. since avowed white supremacist Dylann Roof massacred nine parishioners at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. Most recently, the city of New Orleans toppled four statues honoring the Confederacy. These efforts have made us a target for folks around the country who oppose telling the full story of race,۝ Signer told HuffPost on Friday. They don۪t want the narrative changed or to tell the full story of race. I think this will have the effect of redoubling our progress.To become an honest society, I don۪t think we have any choice but to tell the full story.۝ The rally۪s real purpose, however, shines through in the event۪s advertising, which looks a lot like Nazi propaganda and reads like a poorly billed concert: Spencer۪s followers claimed that that violence was coming to Charlottesville in the form of roving mobs۝ of Antifa ۥ groups of black-clad, masked anti-fascists, anarchists and socialists. It۪s a scare tactic that white nationalists use regularly to pull crowds of people to a city in defense of it. They were able to draw hundreds to Gettysburg over the Fourth of July weekend after claiming members of Antifa were coming to desecrate graves. Antifa never came, but the Ku Klux Klan did, and the only bloodshed came when a lone patriot shot himself in the leg . The weeks and days leading up to the rally in Charlottesville had the city gearing up for war. The city had seen this type of menacing before: White supremacists showed up with torches at the Lee monument in May, an act that evoked Ku Klux Klan symbolism. Some businesses closed down Saturday to keep employees safe. Others reportedly opened their doors solely as a safe space in case of an emergency. Some locals were prepared to take drastic measures to protect their city. As a lifelong resident of Charlottesville and a mother of two, this is about making the world more equitable for my children,۝ Leslie Scott-Jones of Solidarity C۪Ville wrote in a news release. I am not naive about the urgent threat of August 12 , nor do I believe the threat ends there... My family has been here since the 1700_s, this is my home, and I have no other choice than to protect it.۝ This article has been updated with new details, including comments from Trump and anti-fascist demonstrators, information about Fields and information about the various investigations into Saturday۪s events.

Mueller has asked Deutsche Bank to share information on accounts held by the Trump family as part of his investigation into Russia۪s alleged attempts to influence the 2016 election,Reuters reported Tuesday. The bank has loaned the Trump Organization millions of dollars over the years. Trump does not like revealing details of his finances. He still hasn۪t released his tax returns, unlike other presidents in recent history. And in July, Trump implied that he would consider firing Mueller if he started looking into his finances.

Trump has reportedly considered firing Mueller in the past. Last week, after Mueller charged Michael Flynn, Trump۪s former national security adviser, with lying to the FBI, speculation picked up again that the president may take the drastic step. I would worry in a real way that Donald Trump may preemptively pardon some people, and I still worry in a real way that Donald Trump may decide to cause the firing of Robert Mueller ,۝ Preet Bharara, the former U.S. attorney who was ousted by Trump, said on Monday. With Flynn now cooperating with Mueller, the investigation is moving closer and closer to Trump and his inner circle ۥ including his son-in-law and trusted adviser, Jared Kushner . Trump, of course, is in this situation because he initially fired James Comey.The FBI director said Trump approached him and tried to get him to ease up on the Russia investigation and to specifically be lenient toward Flynn ۥ who lied about his interactions with Russian officials before the inauguration.

According to the network, the charges are sealed under a federal judge۪s order. It remains unclear who has been indicted and on what charges. The person or persons indicted could be taken into custody as soon as Monday, CNN said. Federal officials have not yet validated the CNN report, and a spokesman for Mueller declined to comment to Reuters. However, if confirmed,it would mark a major development in the special counsel۪s probe. If anybody thinks the Mueller investigation is going to be wrapping up, this decision guarantees it will go well into 2018,۝ CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller in May,following President Donald Trump ۪s controversial decision to fire FBI Director James Comey amid the agency۪s investigation into possible Russian meddling during the 2016 presidential election.Mueller is a former prosecutor and served as FBI director from 2001 to 2013. Mueller was tasked with overseeing the investigation into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the election,along with any matters that directly arise from the investigation. Since then, reports have emerged that Mueller was investigating whether Trump attempted to obstruct justice. Mueller۪s team is reportedly also looking into a dossier containing explosive, unverified allegations regarding Trump and his associates, compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele for the research firm Fusion GPS. Mueller۪s team is also investigating Trump۪s associates. The team is reportedly looking into possible tax and financial crimes by Paul Manafort.Trump۪s former campaign manager was forced out in August 2016 over his past business dealings with pro-Russian figures in Ukraine. Manafort۪s lobbying firm disclosed in June it was paid$17.1 million for work on behalf of a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine from 2012 to 2014, without Manafort being registered with the Department of Justice as a foreign agent at the time.FBI agents raided Manafort۪s home in July, seizing documents and other items. Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to Trump, said that he had spoken to Manafort at 5 p.m. Friday and, as of that time, Manafort knew nothing of this,۝ referring to the report of the indictments. Stone۪s statement didn۪t clarify matters ۥ a suspect wouldn۪t be informed of an indictment ۥ but it indirectly indicated that Stone and his friend of 40 years (and former business partner) were checking in with each other about where things stood at the close of business this week. A suspect would never be informed of an indictment. Later Friday night, Stone told HuffPost that he had spoken to Manafort at 8:30 p.m. and that the former campaign chairman had said nothing.۝ Stone added that he thought Mueller۪s primary investigative focus was an obstruction case rather than the more central issue of collusion, which presumably would be the greater risk to Manafort. Another close mutual friend of Trump and Manafort, speaking on background to be candid, said that he expected the former campaign manager to be indicted, though he had heard nothing specific as of late Friday . It۪s a shame what۪s going to happen to Paul,۝ the friend said. He wasn۪t even a Trump guy.۝ Trump has fiercely denied allegations that his campaign colluded with the Russians and has referred to the reports about Mueller investigating questions of possible obstruction of justice as the single greatest witch hunt in American political history.۝ Friday۪s news of the reported indictments emerged just hours after Dana Boente, the top federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, submitted his resignation . Boente was simultaneously serving as the head of the Department if Justice۪s National Security Division and had been acting attorney general earlier this year following Trump۪s firing of former acting Attorney General Sally Yates. One of Mueller۪s grand juries was reportedly impaneled in Boente۪s Eastern District of Virginia, which is commonly referred to as a rocket docket۝ because of the fast pace of cases in the federal judicial district. Boente had served at the Justice Department for 33 years and is planning to stay on until his successor is confirmed. The reason for his departure is unclear.

On Sunday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson suggested that the president of the United States does not speak for American values. After deflecting questions from Fox News۪ Chris Wallace about President Donald Trump ۪s failure to condemn white supremacist groups who incited deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, by saying that he and the State Department represent America۪s values,۝ Tillerson said that  the president speaks for himself .۝ Tillerson۪s statement caps a tumultuous two weeks in which Trump demonstrated that he has abandoned essential duties of the office, failing to provide basic, measured responses to violence and natural disasters. Throughout last week, he continued to defend his widely condemned response to the violence in Charlottesville  in which he delayed and then backtracked on a denunciation of white nationalist, KKK and neo-Nazi groups  including during a campaign-style rally in Phoenix. Trump۪s failure to provide the most elementary leadership earned criticism from lawmakers and leaders around the world  even from a United Nations panel on combating racial discrimination , which expressed deep concern about the example this failure could set for the rest of the world.۝ The night Hurricane Harvey slammed into Texas, unleashing potentially historic rainfall, Trump announced he was pardoning former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, who illegally targeted Latinos and was convicted of criminal contempt for violating a court order. In doing so, he bypassed the Department of Justice۪s normal pardon procedures. (Trump reportedly asked his attorney general about closing the criminal case against Arpaio months earlier.) On Sunday, as residents of Texas began evaluating the flooding and damage from the storm, Trump issued a stream of tweets congratulating authorities and himself for the recovery effort, which he bragged wasʉgoing well!۝ The tweets about Hurricane Harvey were sandwiched between posts on unrelated topics, including the president۪s personal grievances . For example, Trump immediately followed the announcement that he would visit Texas with a tweet boasting about his election victory in a different state, while suggesting that he would help unseat the state۪s Democratic senator. Tillerson is not the only administration official attempting to distance himself from the president in recent days. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis can be heard telling U.S. troops in Jordan to hold the line until our country gets back to understanding and respecting each other,۝ in a video posted Thursday on Facebook. Mattis also said the U.S. will get the power of inspiration back,۝ which many interpreted as criticism of Trump۪s leadership. It۪s unclear exactly when Mattis made the impromptu remarks, though he stopped in Jordan during his overseas trip last week. You۪re a great example for our country right now, and it has got problems,۝ Mattis said in the video . You know it and I know it. It۪s got problems we don۪t have in the military. And you just hold the line, my fine soldiers and sailors and airmen and Marines.۝ The president۪s economic adviser, Gary Cohn, told the Financial Times that he contemplated resigning after Trump۪s Charlottesville remarks , saying the administrationʉcan and must do better in consistently and unequivocally condemning these groups.۝ Of course, many in the Trump administration still unambiguously defend the president. After Trump delivered a scripted but conspicuously vague speech on his Afghanistan war strategy, Vice President Mike Pence insisted Trump۪s primetime address signaledʉAmerican resolve.۝ Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said the speech demonstrated the signs of a president.۝ The next day, Trump reverted to form at his no-holds-barred Arizona rally, making it next to impossible to believe that he will treat the presidency with the gravity the office is meant to hold."

He has been terminated for conduct inconsistent with our values and in violation of our policies,۝ a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley told HuffPost in an email. At least one woman, who is not a Morgan Stanley employee but interacted with Ford in a professional capacity, was interviewed by Morgan Stanley۪s HR department as part of the investigation. In two interviews with HuffPost, the woman alleged that Ford engaged in harassment, intimidation, and forcibly grabbed her one evening in Manhattan, leading her to seek aid from a building security guard. The incident took place several years ago when Ford and the woman were supposed to be meeting for professional reasons. Ford continued to contact her after the encounter until she wrote an email asking him to cease contact. The email, which was reviewed by HuffPost, shows that the woman emailed Ford after he repeatedly asked her to drinks. She asked him not to contact her anymore, citing his inappropriate conduct the evening where he forcibly grabbed and harassed her. Ford replied to the email by apologizing and agreeing not to contact her. Hey very sorry. Meant no harm,۝ the email reads. And I apologize for whatever I may have said or what was said. And my overtures are strictly professional. Again I apologize didn۪t mean to be inappropriate at all. Sorry that impression was left.۝ HuffPost is not identifying the woman at her request but has reviewed emails that confirm her interactions with Ford and spoke to two people whom the woman confided in about the incident. One woman heard from Ford۪s accuser the night of the incident and described her as distraught, shocked, and frightened,۝ and said that she was concerned about any career ramifications should she report the incident. In a statement provided to HuffPost, Ford denied the allegations: This simply did not happen. I have never forcibly grabbed any woman or man in my life. Having drinks and dinner for work is part of my job,and all of my outreach to the news reporter making these false allegations was professional and at the direction of my firm for business purposes. I support and have tremendous respect for the brave women now speaking out in this important national dialogue. False claims like this undermine the real silence breakers. I will now be bringing legal action against the reporter who has made these false claims about me as well as Morgan Stanley for improper termination.۝ John Singer, Ford۪s employment counsel with the firm Singer Deutsch LLP, said Morgan Stanley has still not told Harold directly of his termination, and unlike every other circumstance I۪ve been in the company has refused provide me with a reason.۝ He added: This all demonstrates how this was a matter of convenience during a hyper-sensitive time and not based on real facts.۝ Ford comes from a prominent political family in Tennessee. His father, Harold Ford Sr., held a congressional seat for 12 terms before retiring, leaving his son to run for the seat, a race which he won handily. Ford served in the House for nearly 10 years before deciding to run for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Republican Bill Frist. Ford lost that hotly contested 2006 race by fewer than three points to current Republican Sen. Bob Corker. Since leaving Congress in 2007, Ford has worked for two financial services companies, first for Merrill Lynch and then Morgan Stanley, which he joined in 2011 as a managing director. At the time Morgan Stanley announced the hire, The New York Times described Ford۪s role as a rainmaker of sorts:  Mr. Ford will be responsible for building business opportunities۪ for clients, Morgan Stanley said. He will manage relationships with corporate directors, senior executives and institutional investors, as well as private clients.۝ Ford also serves as a paid on-air political analyst for NBC/MSNBC and regularly appears on the MSNBC program Morning Joe.۝ This story has been updated to include statements from Ford and Singer."

President Andrew Jackson added the southern magnolia tree to the White House grounds in honor of his late wife. But the tree has decayed to a point where it can no longer be safely preserved, CNN reports. Stephanie Grisham,Trump۪s spokeswoman,told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the first lady discussed options with White House staff and reviewed an analysis by the United States National Arboretum before deeming that the tree was a safety risk. [Melania Trump]trusted that every effort had been made to preserve the historic tree, and was concerned about the safety of visitors and members of the press who are often standing right in front of the tree during Marine One lifts,۝Grisham told the AP. Grisham said that a large portion۝ of the tree will be removed later this week. Wood and seedlings from the tree will reportedly be preserved for the future. The Jackson Magnolia, also known as a magnolia grandiflora tree, was Andrew Jackson۪s tribute to wife Rachel Jackson. The pair fell in love and attempted to get married while Rachel was still legally married to her former husband , a situation that caused a scandal during the presidential campaign of 1828. Rachel۪s health began to decline as Jackson۪s political career progressed,and her existing medical issues were compounded by personal attacks during the campaign on her marriage and virtue. Rachel died on December 22, 1828, days after her husband was elected as president. Jackson, who blamed his political enemies for his wife۪s death, moved into the White House as a widower. He reportedly asked for a sprout from Rachel۪s favorite magnolia tree at the couple۪s farm in Tennessee to be planted on the White House grounds. It was placed at the west side of the South Portico in 1835, according to the White House Historical Association. A second magnolia tree was later planted on the east side of the Portico, for symmetry. Since its arrival, the tree has been in the backdrop of many events at the White House ۥ from Easter Egg Rolls to routine Marine One departures. Seedlings from the tree have also been used as gifts. President Obama gifted a seedling from the tree to the Israeli people during a trip to former Israeli president Shimon Peres۪ presidential residence in 2013. The Jackson Magnolia started to experience problems in the 1970s, when new trunks, or leaders,۝began to emerge from its base. Cement was later used to help shore up a cavity in the tree, which ended up causing more harm. The tree is now standing up with the help of a pole and cable system. According to a report obtained by CNN , experts at the Arboretum told Trump that this system can no longer prevent the tree from collapsing ۥ and that the tree may actually be a safety hazard. If this was any ordinary tree, it would have been removed long ago,۝ the report from the Arboretum reads. We understand this is a historic tree, and all measures have been used to save it to this point in time. While we cannot comment on the need to preserve the tree as long as it stands, we believe eventually, the tree will fail.۝ The White House said on Tuesday that seedlings from the original tree will be available in the future, if another tree needs to be planted on the lawn. CORRECTION: In a previous version of this story,a wire photo caption misidentified a Japanese magnolia tree as a Southern magnolia."

During remarks at Trump Tower, the president blasted protesters on both sides۝ of the conflict in Charlottesville, echoing his initial statement that there was hatred on many sides.۝ You had a group on one side who was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent, and nobody wants to say that, but I۪ll say it right now,۝ Trump said, referring to white supremacists, anti-fascists known as antifa۝and counterprotesters who converged in Charlottesville over the weekend. You had a group on the other side that came charging in without a permit, and they were very, very violent.۝ Trump explained why he wasn۪t quick to condemn any specific people in his initial statement on the protests . You have people who are very fine people on both sides,۝ Trump said. He argued he was waiting on the facts۝ Saturday before condemning white supremacists. I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct, not make a quick statement. The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement, but you don۪t make statements that direct unless you know the facts,۝ Trump argued. It takes a little while to get the facts. You still don۪t know the facts. It is a very, very important process to me. It is a very important statement. So I don۪t want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement. I want to know the facts.۝ Trump stayed silent until Saturday afternoon on the situation in Charlottesville, which began heating up with white supremacist marches Friday night. His response ۥ which followed that of his wife, Melania, the first from the White House to comment on the protests ۥ was a rebuke of hatredʉ on many sides .۝ We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides ۥ on many sides,۝ Trump said at a ceremony for the signing of a bill to reform the Veterans Affairs health care system. It۪s been going on for a long time in our country, not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama.

But on Tuesday, Trump issued his strongest statement yet, pointing blame at groups who showed up to demonstrate against the white supremacists who organized in Charlottesville to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee, a Confederate general. What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, alt-right۪? Do they have any semblance of guilt?۝ Trump asked reporters.

The report follows Mueller stepping up the probe by hiring several high-powered lawyers. Reuters reported earlier this week that Greg Andres , a former Justice Department attorney who specialized in corruption and bribery cases, joined the investigation. Grand jury subpoenas related to a meeting attended by Trump Jr., the president۪s eldest son, and a Russian lawyer have been issued, sources told Reuters . Trump Jr. agreed to the meeting after being promised information that would incriminate۝ his father۪s opponent, Hillary Clinton, and was part of the Russian government۪s effort to benefit Trump. A source familiar with the matter told Reuters that Mueller was investigating whether anyone at the meeting or affiliated with the Trump campaign encouraged Russia to release damaging material it had collected on Clinton. Another told the outlet that Mueller was trying to determine if Trump had been informed of the meeting ahead of time, or if he was briefed after it took place. The president has strongly denied having had any knowledge of the meeting, but has not faulted his son for attending it. Mueller۪s probe is one of several government investigations into possible collusion. He is also investigating whether Trump obstructed justice. Read the full Wall Street Journal story here . Assembling a grand jury marks a major step, as it suggests an aggressive and prolonged investigation. Grand juries can be used as legal tools in cases when there is the possibility of criminal conduct , legal experts say. The grand jury, which will be based in Washington, D.C., does not necessarily signify that criminal charges will be brought. But it means it can hear testimony from witnesses under oath, and that the investigation can issue subpoenas to obtain documents. Trump has criticized the investigation as a witch hunt,۝ and hinted at removing Mueller. Meanwhile, there has been bipartisan support for legislation to protect Mueller from being fired by Trump . Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller in May, after Trump fired then-FBI Director James Comey amid the agency۪s investigation into Trump۪s campaign. According to Comey, Trump had told Comey to pledge his loyalty to him, undermining the independence of the FBI. He also asked Comey to lay off the FBI۪s investigation into former national security adviser Mike Flynn, who lied about his contacts with Russian officials. Last month, in an interview with The New York Times, Trump warned Mueller to not investigate his finances. Soon after, several sources reported that Mueller had begun including Trump۪s finances as part of the probe . White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Thursday in a statement that Trump himself was not under investigation. She referred to Ty Cobb, a member of Trump۪s outside legal team representing him in the Russia investigations. Ty Cobb, special counsel to the president, said he wasn۪t aware that Mr. Mueller had started using a new grand jury. Grand jury matters are typically secret,۝ Mr. Cobb said. The White House favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly....The White House is committed to fully cooperating with Mr. Mueller.۝ Former FBI Director Jim Comey said three times the President is not under investigation and we have no reason to believe that has changed. Jay Sekulow, another member of Trump۪s legal team, similarly told Fox News thatʉwe have no reason to believe that the president۪s under investigation here.۝ Sekulow downplayed the news of a grand jury as not an unusual move,۝ calling it standard prosecutorial approach.۝ He also suggested that the investigation will be resolved quickly, saying he thinks Mueller will move expeditiously through the process۝with the grand jury in place. He also affirmed that Trump does not plan to remove Mueller. The president is not thinking about firing Bob Mueller,۝ he said.

Diane Black (R-Tenn.) proposed on Friday that hospital emergency rooms should be able to turn patients away to help keep health care costs down. I۪m an emergency room nurse,۝ Black told MSNBC host Chuck Todd on Friday. There are people that came into my emergency room that I, the nurse, was the first one to see them. I could have sent them to a walk-in clinic or their doctor the next day, but because of a law that Congress put into place to say, no, I have to treat everybody that walks into that emergency room.۝ You took away our ability to say, No, an emergency room is not the proper place.۪ And then, you put a burden on top of that to say, You must do that,۪۝added the congresswoman, who is also running for governor of Tennessee. At issue is the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, which was signed into law by former President Ronald Reagan in 1986. It was a congressional response to stories ofʉpatient dumping۝ ۥ hospitals would deny treatment to patients or send them elsewhere , usually because the individuals didn۪t have insurance. Many of these patients were unemployed or were people of color. Those transferred individuals were more likely to die, and the delayed care often jeopardized the patients۪ health. The law put a particular focus on pregnant women (hence active labor۝ in the law۪s name), to ensure that they would be able to deliver their babies and receive full care. Changing the law, as Black advocates, would send America back to a time when hospitals can use their discretion to turn people away. We must treat everybody that walks in whether you۪ve had a sore throat for a week, we must see them. And that crowds the emergency room. It drives the cost of emergencies up,۝ Black added on MSNBC. And so, yes, if someone comes in from an auto accident, I don۪t want to ask whether they have insurance or not. I۪m going to take care of them.۝ But what it did is crowd my emergency room, where I work,۝ she added. And disallowed me from using my good judgment skills, of which I was trained to do and doctors are as well. And the federal government said, you must ۥ and you can۪t make those decisions. And I think that was a poor thing for us to do.۝ This free-for-all system would not be unlike what happened before Obamacare, when there were fewer requirements for insurance companies to accept people for coverage. It was a time when insurance providers were free to turn people away because they had more expensive pre-existing conditions ۥ or were labeled as potentially having an expensive condition down the line. And since these companies were free to do so, they did. Nobody thinks EMTALA is perfect and non-partisan organizations, including the Institute of Medicine , have long called for revising some of the law۪s regulations as part of a broader strategy to ease emergency room overcrowding. And although conservatives have been among the most critical of the law, even the Heritage Foundation admits that the outright repeal of EMTALA is highly unlikely ,۝ and it۪s not something you hear talked about much in health care debates. When Todd asked Black whether she would get rid of the law, she replied, I would get rid of a law that says that you ۥ you are not allowed, as a health care professional, to make that decision about whether someone can be appropriately treated the next day, or at a walk-in clinic, or at their doctor.۝ Also, technically, no doctor or hospital is required to see anybody. But treating all patients is a requirement for hospitals using Medicare funds.So already, a doctor or hospital can turn people away ۥ as Black suggests they should be able to do ۥ they just won۪t get to bill Medicare.

At his first stop, a briefing with federal and local officials, Trump lavishly praised them. He then repeatedly turned to individuals around the table and invited them to offer their own praise  while insisting, It۪s not about me.۝ When Puerto Rico۪s governor told Trump that 16 people so far had been reported dead,the president lauded officials and minimized the hurricane۪s damage, suggesting it was not a real catastrophe like Katrina.۝ Sixteen people versus in the thousands,۝ Trump said. You can be very proud of all of your people and all of our people working together.Sixteen versus literally thousands of people. You can be very proud. Everyone around this table, and everyone watching, can be very proud of what۪s taking place in Puerto Rico.۝ While Trump bragged about the official number of dead, the final death toll will likely turn out to be higher . Poor communication services have hindered reporting, and current living conditions on the island could jeopardize more lives,especially those of the sick and the elderly. Trump also appeared to joke about the cost of the storm damage. I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you۪ve thrown our budget a little out of whack,۝ he said. The group of officials around the table applauded several times.

The trip comes after Trump repeatedly bragged about his administration۪s response to the hurricane۪s devastation,blamed the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico for its debt crisis and called Cruz nasty۝ for criticizing the federal government۪s sluggish relief efforts. Trump, who visited Texas twice in the days following Hurricane Harvey and headed to Florida four days after Hurricane Irma, said last week that he was delaying a visit to Puerto Rico because of the first responders, and we don۪t want to disrupt the relief efforts.۝ Tensions were high ahead of the president۪s visit.

And I۪ll tell you what, I think we۪ve done just as good in Puerto Rico, and it۪s actually a much tougher situation.۝ Again he said that at a local level, they have to give us more help,۝ while praising the incredible job۝ of federal officials. Whether it۪s her or anybody else, they۪re all starting to say it,۝ Trump said. Following the briefing with federal and local officials on Tuesday, Trump visited with storm victims. He again praised officials for doing a fantastic job,۝ as people showed him the storm۪s damage to their homes, pointing out broken windows and noting power outages. We۪re going to help you out,۝ he told them. Have a good time.۝ During a stop at a church, he threw rolls of paper towels into a crowd. In truth, conditions in Puerto Rico remain dire. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has shipped millions of gallons of water and meals to Puerto Rico, but the island no longer has the infrastructure to widely deliver those supplies. Puerto Rican officials said last week that they were unable to move aid across the island without electricity and fuel. Until last week, shipments to the island were also restricted by the Jones Act , a law that increases shipping costs for goods going to Puerto Rico. Trump allowed a temporary waiver of the law last Thursday. As of Monday, all 10 of Puerto Rico۪s airports were open, and about 37 percent of people had cellphone service, according to the Department of Defense. Two Navy ships are due to arrive Tuesday with more supplies. Still, almost all of Puerto Rico is without electricity ,and about half the population lacks drinking water. This article has been updated with details from Trump۪s visit. CORRECTION: A previous version of this article stated incorrectly that all 10 of Puerto Rico۪s hospitals۝ had been reopened. All 10 of the airports have been reopened."

Trump reportedly made the remark during dinner on Friday at the exclusive Florida resort,where initiation fees cost $200,000, just hours after he signed the bill into law. Asked for comment by CBS News , the White House on Saturday stood by its claims that the legislation would benefit the middle class. While households at every income level will see a tax cut next year , wealthy taxpayers would benefit the most from the bill , according to independent analysts. The heart of the measure is a massive corporate tax cut ۥa permanent reduction in the top rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. Most tax cuts for individuals, however, are set to expire in eight years. The remarks Trump reportedly made on Friday also seemingly contradict a promise he made several months ago when he first began pitching his tax proposal to Congress. The rich will not be gaining at all with this plan,۝ Trump said after a Sept. 12 meeting with lawmakers at the White House. We are looking for the middle class, and we are looking for jobs, jobs being the economy. So, we۪re looking at middle class, and we۪re looking at jobs,۝ he added. Trump۪s friends likely won۪t be the only ones who stand to gain from the tax cut legislation.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-sexual-harassment-discrimination_us_5a15b385e4b03dec8249b7e5","To the droves of women speaking up about sexual harassment and discrimination, the Trump administration۪s message is clear: Shut up. Behind the scenes, and mostly through executive orders, the White House is making it harder for women to report sexual harassment and fight sex discrimination. The clearest example came in March. It received little coverage at the time. President Donald Trump reversed an Obama-era order that forbid federal contractors from keeping secret sexual harassment and discrimination cases. The 2014 rule prohibited these companies, which employ about 26 million people, from forcing workers to resolve complaints through arbitration, an increasingly common method businesses use to settle disputes out of the public eye. This was a clear sign of the administration silencing women,۝ said Jessica Stender, senior staff attorney for Equal Rights Advocates, a women۪s rights nonprofit. And it۪s only a small piece of the picture. The Trump administration has a clear anti-women agenda,۝ Stender said. I say that with complete certainty. This is an all-out, full frontal attack on women.۝ The attack so far has seen the most success via executive order, but a vast swath of the public policies proposed or endorsed by administration officials attempt to scale back women۪s rights. From Trump۪s repeal of executive orders meant to reduce pay discrimination to the budget floated in May , the failed repeal of Obamacare , and now the Republican tax bills , actions taken or backed by this administration harm women . This war on women comes at a time when feminist ideals have never seemed more powerful. Finally, sexual assault victims are being heard and believed. Sexual predators like Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein are facing real consequences, losing their jobs, their movie deals, their companies. And, though it۪s hard to believe now, the U.S. just last year came extremely close to electing its first female president. In this atmosphere, the Trump administration۪s actions look remarkably like a real-time backlash to the growing assertion of female power. The assault on women began almost instantly after the primal female scream that was the women۪s march in January. That month, Trump signed his first executive order (surrounded by men). Literally a  gag rule ,۝ meant to prevent health clinics around the world from even talking about abortion. He was just warming up his pen. After the order on arbitration came in March, the administration in August ditched an innovative equal pay initiative launched by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Currently, women on average make just 80 percent of what men earn. And women of color face even wider pay gaps. The scrapped provision would۪ve required companies to report data on how much they pay workers ۥ broken down by race and ethnicity ۥ in order to make it easier to figure out the scope of the pay gap and ideally help close it. The EEOC spent six years devising this rule. The agency worked with the National Academy of Sciences to set-up a study on the pay gap, and revised and tweaked its proposal after consulting with employers and opening it up to public comment. The Office of Management and Budget scrapped the rule with little explanation, beyond saying it would create too much paperwork and impose too much of a burden on corporations. It would۪ve cost each company $416.58 to comply, according to an EEOC estimate . We think it۪s outrageous,۝ said Robin Thurston, the lead litigator in a lawsuit filed by the National Women۪s Law Center and the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement that seeks to overturn the decision. The data collection would have had benefits that far outstripped these costs, she said, enabling the EEOC to better enforce civil rights law and find companies with noticeable pay gaps. The agency hasn۪t yet responded to the suit. Keeping information on pay discrimination out of the public۪s eye is, of course, another way to silence women ۥ and it۪s quite effective. Without pay transparency, women and people of color have no way of knowing if they۪re paid unfairly and the practice can linger. If women do figure out they۪re underpaid, their complaint could wind up in private arbitration. Colleagues facing similar situations won۪t know anything. Nothing changes. But the administration wasn۪t done trying to silence women. In September, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos rescinded a key Obama-era effort meant to help victims of sexual harassment and assault on college campuses: A 2011 letter sent by the administration to colleges defining sexual assault and setting a new standard for how schools should respond to such accusations. Trump, himself accused of sexual misconduct or sexually assaulting at least 13 women , has been largely silent on the recent outpouring of stories of such abuse by well-known and powerful men. One exception: Trump used Twitter to mock Sen. Al Franken after misconduct allegations surfaced against the Minnesota Democrat. On Tuesday, Trump publicly defended Republican Roy Moore, the 70-year-old Senate candidate in Alabama who has been accused of preying on underage girls as a younger man. He says it didn۪t happen. You have to listen to him also,۝ the president told reporters. Of course, part of his reticence to acknowledge the veracity of these women۪s claims may be that it would undercut Trump۪s repeated insistence that all the women who accuse him of sexual predation are simply liars. Also on Tuesday, Trump was asked for his message to women during this pivotal moment.۝ Women are very special,۝ he said . I think it۪s a very special time because a lot of things are coming out, and I think that۪s good for our society and I think it۪s very, very good for women, and I۪m very happy a lot of these things are coming out. I۪m very happy it۪s being exposed.۝ His answer is totally empty of meaning. These words mean nothing. They are a yearbook signature,۝ writes Alexandra Petri in the Washington Post . And his statement is completely belied by his actions. Women aren۪t standing for it. This moment, where more and more women are coming forward to expose sexual abuse, feels like just a beginning. It almost seems like this outpouring is a backlash against Trump,۝ Stender said. It۪s heartening.۝"

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-weighing-retirement_us_5a31ce86e4b07ff75b00274d","WASHINGTON ۥ As Republicans finish their long-sought rewrite of the tax code, some lawmakers are beginning to wonder just how much longer Rep. Paul Ryan intends to remain speaker. There۪s a whole lot of rumors and speculation that the speaker may step aside,۝ one GOP member told HuffPost this week, a sentiment that was expressed by a number of Republicans who, perhaps tellingly, wouldn۪t go on the record to speak about Ryan۪s future. The Wisconsin Republican has made no indication he۪s quitting any time soon, but the possibility that Ryan finishes the tax bill and decides he no longer wants to continue in Congress has begun to loom over internal Republican conversations. When the House Freedom Caucus gathered Monday night, members spent part of their meeting discussing a theory circulating on Capitol Hill and among the downtown Christmas parties that Ryan may believe he۪s harpooned his personal white whale of tax reform and decide he۪s finished. Is it a Boehner-meeting-the-pope moment?۝ one Freedom Caucus member rhetorically asked HuffPost, referring to Ryan۪s predecessor, John Boehner (R-Ohio), who hosted Pope Francis for a joint address to Congress in September 2015 and then announced his retirement the next morning. Ryan refused to run for the speakership twice after Boehner announced his resignation, once just after Boehner۪s decision and then again after Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) abruptly changed his mind and stepped out of the speaker۪s race. Eventually, Ryan accepted the position, reluctantly, with some conditions. But lawmakers and aides who spoke to HuffPost on the condition of anonymity over the last week say they believe this is still a job Ryan doesn۪t enjoy. On top of ruling over a GOP conference that۪s just as unruly as when Boehner was speaker, Ryan has had to navigate Donald Trump ۥ a task that۪s left him looking feckless to the left and like an enemy of the president to the right. The speculation over Ryan۪s next move has particularly intensified as Republicans negotiate spending deals with Democrats. Ryan has repeatedly pushed off the possibility that a legislative solution for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigration program will be attached to a government spending agreement, but conservatives are worried Republicans could finish their tax bill, have the speaker announce his retirement and then watch Ryan do the same kind of  barn cleaning ۝ that Boehner did at the end of his speakership. The last deal to raise spending caps for two years, in fact, was set under Boehner. Republicans and Democrats are reportedly close to a deal now to once again raise those spending limits for another two years, but conservatives are becoming increasingly certain this isn۪t a bill they۪ll support. Ryan۪s leaving could pave the way for Republicans to swallow a January spending deal with mostly Democratic votes, perhaps raise the debt ceiling again ۥ another thing Boehner did as he headed for the exit ۥ and potentially find a DACA fix. It۪s unclear whether Ryan has any further political aspirations beyond this job, but some Republicans think Ryan would be served well by offering himself as a sacrifice for the completion of an immigration deal, particularly if Ryan۪s political aspirations are far off in the future. (Or if he doesn۪t have any future political aspirations.) On the other side of the argument, Ryan۪s stepping down now could hurt Republicans. Ryan۪s fundraising prowess has helped GOP campaign accounts stay flush with cash in an upcoming election cycle that could be tough for Republicans. And Ryan doesn۪t seem to have any direct threat to his speakership. Nobody, not even the Freedom Caucus, is really discussing a motion to remove the speaker at this moment. Ryan is also headed for a moment of coronation among GOP members with the passage of this tax bill. That could be the shot in the arm. But that celebration will be short-lived if, as expected, upcoming spending deals put Republicans in the position of significantly raising non-defense spending and shoring up Obamacare. Part of the problem for Ryan is simply that the expectations of the speakership have become unrealistic. The GOP conference has diffuse interests, and prioritizing those interests ۥ whether they be of defense hawks, fiscal hawks, moderates or just the Republicans who don۪t shut down government ۥ will naturally create enemies. Ryan isn۪t without blame, of course. He managed to offend all sides with his on-again-off-again relationship with Trump, and he۪s been less than honest about how he۪s ruled over the House. The 10-term congressman came into the speakership promising a more open legislative process. Two years into the job, however, Ryan has taken the restrictions on what amendments will be allowed on the floor to new heights. There wasn۪t a single open۝ rule this year where lawmakers could offer any relevant amendment to a bill under consideration. And the legislative accomplishments Ryan touts ۥ whether it be the number of bills passed or that Republicans passed all 12 appropriations bills ۥ are grossly overstated. (The House has passed far more post office naming bills than in recent years, and the 12 appropriations bills۝ were in the form of a couple of packages, written to spending numbers that weren۪t real, with a confined amendment process.) Still, when HuffPost asked Ryan۪s spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, whether the speaker believed he had lived up to his promises of an open process, she said he had. Strong also said Ryan was committed to finishing this term in Congress and that he had no intention of retiring in the middle of a session. Asked what else Ryan wanted to accomplish as speaker, Strong mentioned an infrastructure package and said welfare reform۝ remained an important unfinished item۝ from the GOP۪s Better Way agenda. That may sound definitive and convincing, but then again so did the quotes coming from Boehner۪s staff the day before he announced his resignation. When Time asked Boehner۪s communications director, Kevin Smith, whether he was considering retirement, Boehner۪s long-time aide was emphatic. He۪s not going anywhere,۝ Smith said in a story that posted the morning Boehner announced his resignation. If there۪s a small crew of members who think that he۪s just going to pick up and resign in the middle of his term, they are going to be sadly mistaken.۝"

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/doug-jones-wins_us_5a3026a9e4b091ca26833755","This time, Donald Trump ۪s playbook didn۪t work. Republican Roy Moore faced serious accusations of sexual misconduct in his bid to become Alabama۪s next senator. But instead of bowing down and backing out, he stayed in the race and went on the attack ۥ just like Trump did in last year۪s presidential race. He accused the media and the establishment of orchestrating a conspiracy against him, and cast the race as pitting good against evil, Christians versus everyone else. Both Trump and Moore bet that their conservative base would stick by them and push them to victory. But on Tuesday, Alabama sent a message that this time it wouldn۪t work, not even in a conservative state that Trump won by 28 percentage points in 2016. Voters instead elected Doug Jones, making him the first Democrat to win a U.S. Senate seat in the state in 25 years. The Associated Press called the race for Jones 2_ hours after polls closed in the state. We have shown the country the way that we can be unified,۝ an ecstatic Jones said in his victory speech Tuesday night. When Jeff Sessions stepped down as senator nine months ago to become Trump۪s attorney general, it was considered a sure bet that the seat would remain in GOP control. But then Moore came along, defeating the establishment choice in the Republican primary and giving Democrats a glimmer of hope that they could win ۥ or at least do better than they thought possible in Alabama. Some Moore supporters were in disbelief Tuesday night. Willie Casey, 70, a Republican from Birmingham who was standing outside the Moore watch party, said there has to be a recount.۝ It was tight. I۪m disappointed,۝ he told HuffPost. I think [Sen. Richard] Shelby coming out against him made a huge difference, but I also think the whole thing is suspicious.۝ Moore himself refused to concede as well. Speaking to supporters at his election night party, Moore suggested the possibility of demanding a recount, saying, God is still in control.۝ The controversial Moore, 70, had long been known for his conservative religious beliefs , opposing equal rights for Muslims and the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community. And though he won statewide races for chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, his vote counts underperformed compared with other Republicans on the ballot. Then in November,The Washington Post published an article in which four women accused Moore of pursuing them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. One of them said she was 14 when he sexually assaulted her. After that story came out, more women came forward with similar stories about Moore. Even after the bombshell allegations, Democrats were skeptical Jones, 63, could win. It was still Alabama, a state that Republicans dominate. But the Jones campaign set about focusing on three goals : 1) expand the Democratic electorate, especially by getting more African-American voters to turn out; 2) persuade some Republicans disgusted by Moore to vote for Jones; 3) hope other Republicans would simply stay home. National Democrats tried to help out by staying quiet. Associating with the party wouldn۪t help Jones, who was trying to emphasize that he would work across the aisle and not be beholden to people like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). Democrats also got lucky with Jones, who had a strong biography (he was a U.S. attorney who prosecuted Ku Klux Klan members for a 1963 church bombing that killed four African-American girls) and made few major missteps during the campaign. While Republicans are no doubt unhappy to lose a Senate seat, there are also some sighs of relief. There۪s a solid case to be made that they۪ll be able to win it back during the regular election in 2020, if they have a more traditional candidate. And now, they won۪t have to constantly be on the defensive about being a party that harbors an accused child molester. They will still, however, have to contend with being the party that has a man accused of sexual misconduct by 19 women sitting in the White House. Moore supporters immediately began blaming the GOP establishment. Shelby, publicly condemned Moore and refused to vote for him, has earned the ire of many conservatives in the state recently. But Roger Bowman, 67, a Moore supporter from Millbrook, told HuffPost that Trump was also to blame for endorsing Moore۪s opponent, Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.), in the primary. I۪m seriously angry. I۪d like to say something to those establishment Republicans about this. That man [Jones] is a baby killer and we۪re gonna put him in office?۝ Bowman said, referring to Jones۪ support for abortion rights. I have absolutely no use for Shelby now, I think he۪s an idiot. I think Trump should have stayed out of Alabama helping Luther Strange like that. I۪m a man who votes based on the scripture, and we didn۪t get that tonight.۝ Chanel Rion, the 27-year-old fiancee of Missouri Senate candidate Courtland Sykes, said Jones۪ win was a victory for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) who fought against Moore in the primary and was critical of him throughout the race. There۪s blood in the water for Mitch McConnell, it leads back to him. This room is gonna be walking out with a vengeance. We know who۪s responsible,۝ she said at Moore۪s party. This election has proven that if three floozies and a fake headline can steal an election, then they۪re gonna use this as a template to go further,۝ she added. Special elections aren۪t reliable predictors for what will happen during a regular election. But Jones۪ win gives a boost to the resistance movement that formed after Trump۪s victory last year, and it underscores the importance for the party of investing in all 50 states ۥ so that when a Moore-like opportunity comes around, Democrats are ready to take advantage of it. It also showed yes, there are some allegations too grotesque for voters to stomach, even when a candidate follows Trump۪s playbook.

Desiree Fairooz , 61, who was associated with the group Code Pink, had been convicted of disorderly and disruptive conduct and demonstrating inside the Capitol.Fairooz was taken into custody during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in January after she laughed when Sen.

Fairooz۪s attorney had argued that she had the right to object to her arrest as she was being taken out of the room, and that a conviction based upon her conduct after the initial laugh could not stand.Attorney Sam Bogash asked the judge to toss out the jury verdict .The jury, Bogash wrote,ʉwas not reasonable۝ in its evaluation of the evidence. Ms. Fairooz۪s brief reflexive burst of noise, be it laughter or an audible gasp, clearly cannot sustain a conviction for either of the counts in the information,۝ Bogash wrote in a court filing. So the only other basis for her conviction to anything are her statements after the U.S. Capitol Police arrested her for that laughing. Those statements merely expressed surprise at being arrested.۝ While some of Fairooz۪s statements as she was being arrested ۥ like Why am I being taken out of here?۝ ۥ objected to her treatment, others, like This man is evil, pure evil,۝ were more political in nature, and perhaps more likely to support a conviction. Kimberly Paschall, an attorney for the government, argued during a court hearing on Friday that Ms. Fairooz was not merely responding۝ to her arrest.ʉShe wasn۪t just merely responding, she was voicing an opinion,۝ Paschall said. The government argued that the jury۪s guilty verdict should be upheld . Paschall had argued in court filings that the government had presented evidence that the defendant engaged in disorderly or disruptive conduct when she loudly laughed at Senator Shelby۪s comments.۝ Jurorsʉcould reasonably infer that the laugh was a deliberate disruption۝ and intentional,۝ Paschall wrote. The government also focused on Fairooz۪s conduct after the officer tried to take her into custody. She did not merely laugh,۝Paschall wrote.ʉJust as a defendant cannot resist arrest when the arrest is unlawful, a defendant should not be able to disrupt a hearing before Congress based on her opinion that police action was unlawful.۝ When Judge Morin said in court on Friday no one could know the basis of the jury۪s conviction, Paschall tried to bring up interviews that HuffPost had conducted with the jurors after the meeting, in which they said they were focused on her actions after the laughter.ʉShe did not get convicted for laughing. It was her actions as she was being asked to leave,۝ the jury foreperson told HuffPost at the time . Judge Morin said those interviews were irrelevant. Counsel, you know that۪s not admissible,۝ Morin told Paschall. He then ordered a new trial. Fairooz told HuffPost it was absurd,۝ ridiculous,۝ and a waste of tax dollars۝ that she may have to go to trial again. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney۪s Office for the District of Columbia declined to comment on whether the government planned to retry the case. For a little giggle in the Sessions hearing, it۪s outrageous,۝ Fairooz told HuffPost. I think they۪re harassing me, it۪s awful.۝ Fairooz said she had been hoping that the judge wouldn۪t give the government another chance to bring it to trial. Why it got to this point, I don۪t understand,۝ she said. News of Fairooz۪s prosecution went viral after it was first reported by HuffPost. The international news coverage sparked jokes by late-night comedians , including Stephen Colbert, and attracted the attention of Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee. In a letter to the judge, Conyers wrote thatʉsubstantial questions exist with respect to the application of law۝ in Fairooz۪s case, and asked for leniency. As the Ranking Member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, I take seriously breaches of decorum in Congress,۝ Conyers wrote. However, in this instance, the finding of guilt under these particular circumstances raises questions that should counsel leniency with regard to sentencing.۝ Tighe Barry and Lenny Bianchi, two protesters tried alongside Fairooz for their actions at the hearing while dressed up as members of the KKK , were sentenced on Friday to 10 days suspension, meaning they likely won۪t serve any jail time unless they violate the conditions of their six-month unsupervised probation. Restrictions were placed on their access to Capitol Hill. A spokeswoman for Sessions declined to comment late Friday on whether the attorney general would like his prosecutors to once again bring the case before a jury. This story has been updated to include more information about the government۪s arguments supporting the verdict, as well as comment from Fairooz."

The president۪s family business is worth about one-tenth of the value he has claimed, according to an analysis of the latest figures he has filed with the federal government. Some of the discrepancy is due to a downturn in business, but the rest is credited to an overheated imagination, according to Crain۪s New York Business reporter Aaron Elstein, who examined the numbers. Elstein told NPR he feels a bit like he was played . In 2016 the Trump Organization reported nearly $9.5 billion in sales. But recent public filings by the president indicate that the company۪s actual revenue that year was only as much as $700 million, Crain۪s said. Crain۪s determined Trump has been reporting inflated revenue since at least 2010. After examining the latest figures Trump has filed, Crain۪s this month bounced the Trump Organization from the No. 3 spot on its list of largest privately held New York City companies down to No. 40. It was obviously very important to Donald to have his company on the top of the list... but the numbers that he presented are just flagrantly untrue,۝ Elstein told NPR. Crain۪s said the $9.5 billion in revenue looks preposterous in light of federal filings made by the president in the past year.۝ Trump۪s properties aren۪t doing so well, even though it۪s halcyon days۝ for real estate developers, according to Crain۪s. Not only are the Trump Organization۪s plans to develop a Scion hotel in Manhattan apparently dead in the water, but prices are slumping for condos at Trump Tower and the Trump International Hotel and Tower,۝ Crain۪s said. The average price per square foot for condos at Trump Tower has fallen by 23 percent since 2015,The Wall Street Journal reported, while prices at other midtown developments have remained steady. At Trump۪s International Hotel and Tower on Central Park, the average price per square foot is down 24 percent. And revenue is down on the Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point in the Bronx, falling by more than $1.1 million in the past two years, to $5.7 million,Crain۪s reported. Trump also toppled on another list , down an astonishing 92 places (to No. 248), in Forbes۪ rankings of richest men in America. But Trump remains a billionaire on the Forbes list, where he clocks in at $3.1 billion in total assets. He also took a dive on Bloomberg۪s Billionaires index, but is credited with still having a total $2.9 billion in assets, as far as Bloomberg knows. In 2015 Trump boasted: My massive net worth is in excess of $10 billion.۝ Net worth is a subjective feeling,۝ Trump said in a 2006 deposition when he sued author Timothy O۪Brien, who wrote Trump Nation, a book that was critical of him . My net worth fluctuates, and it goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings, even my own feelings ,۝ he said then. Since Trump hasn۪t released his tax returns, as presidents typically do, his income and information about holdings is murky. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington is currently suing Trump for failing to put his business interests into a blind trust.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/school-voucher-evangelical-education-betsy-devos_us_5a021962e4b04e96f0c6093c","PORTLAND, Ore. ۥ It was late morning in an artsy cafe, the smell of coffee and baked goods sweetening the air, and Ashley Bishop sat at a table, recalling a time when she was taught that most of secular American society was worthy of contempt. Growing up in private evangelical Christian schools, Bishop saw the world in extremes, good and evil, heaven and hell. She was taught that to dance was to sin, that gay people were child molesters and that mental illness was a function of satanic influence. Teachers at her schools talked about slavery as black immigration, and instructors called environmentalists hippie witches.۝ Bishop۪s family moved around a lot when she was a child, but her family always enrolled her in evangelical schools. So when Bishop left school in 2003 and entered the real world at 17, she felt like she was an alien landing on Planet Earth for the first time. Having been cut off from mainstream society, she felt unequipped to handle the job market and develop secular friendships. Lacking shared cultural and historical references, she spent most of her 20s holed up in her bedroom, suffering from crippling social anxiety. Now, at 31, she has become everything that she was once taught to hate. She shares an apartment with her girlfriend of two years. She sees a therapist and takes medication for depression, a condition born, in part, of her stifling education. Years later, some of the schools Bishop attended are largely the same, but some have changed in a significant way: Unlike when Bishop was a student, parents are not the only ones paying tuition for these fundamentalist religious schools  so are taxpayers. These schools are among thousands in the United States that participate in private school choice programs, which most often come in the form of state-level voucher or tax credit scholarships. Voucher programs offer publicly funded financial aid to parents for private schools. Tax credit programs usually offer individuals or corporations tax credits if they donate to a scholarship granting organization, which in turn offers private school scholarships based on various criteria, including income. President Donald Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos have openly championed such programs and have encouraged states to embrace school choice, arguing that voucher programs give parents an alternative to low-performing public schools. Currently 14 states and the District of Columbia have voucher programs, and 17 have tax credit programs. DeVos has made it a top priority to push a federal school choice initiative. Many of the private schools that participate in these state-led programs are run by evangelical Christian churches. They are sometimes unaccredited and can teach a curriculum similar to the one Bishop studied ۥ all with the help of taxpayer dollars. The textbooks used at all of Bishop۪s schools were published by three of the most popular, and most ideologically extreme, Christian textbook companies: Abeka, Bob Jones University Press and Accelerated Christian Education. The ideas in these textbooks often flout widely accepted science and historical fact. But the number of schools using these resources is largely unknown, even in states where they receive support from publicly funded scholarships. No state or federal organization tracks the curriculum being used in private school choice programs. The religious affiliations of schools that participate in these programs are also not always tracked. That means there are thousands of kids receiving an extremist and ultraconservative education at the expense of taxpayers. Several months ago, HuffPost set out to create a database of every private school in the country that receives taxpayer funding. We also tracked the religious affiliation of each school and looked at how many taught from these evangelical Christian textbooks. HuffPost obtained lists of schools that participate in private school choice programs around the country. We searched for the most up-to-date lists on either a state۪s education or revenue department۪s website. Several states did not keep a list of which schools participate in choice programs. In those instances, we went directly to the individual scholarship granting organizations in each state. Our list totaled about 7,200 across the 25 of 27 states that offer private school choice along with the District of Columbia. (Two states that do not allow religious schools to participate in private school choice programs were excluded from our analysis.) Then we researched the religious affiliations of each school by scouring each school۪s website. If a school did not maintain a website, we emailed school representatives and often followed up with a phone call. Our analysis found that about 75 percent of voucher schools across the country are religious ۥ usually Christian or Catholic, with about 2 percent identifying as Jewish and 1 percent identifying as Muslim. There were gray areas: At least five schools identified as non-religious but used a curriculum created by the founder of the Church of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard. Since a plurality of schools in these programs (42 percent) are non-Catholic Christian schools, we dove deeply into researching the curriculum of those schools. We searched their websites for information on curriculum sources and sent out emails to school leaders if they did not make their academic plan public. We did not assess Catholic schools, which made up 31 percent of Christian schools, since there is already a large body of research on the outcomes of students who go to these schools. Evangelical Christian schools are newer ۥ many popped up only a few decades ago  and remain less scrutinized. Indeed, we found many of the non-Catholic Christian schools (33 percent) were using Abeka, Bob Jones or ACE textbooks in at least one subject or grade. We found that Abeka was the most popular textbook source ۥ used in about 27 percent of non-Catholic Christian schools ۥ and Accelerated Christian Education was the least popular ۥ used in about 5 percent of these schools. We could not definitively ascertain the curriculum used by about 1,800 Christian schools, because they did not respond to requests for information. Around 200 Christian schools told us they did not use these three textbook sources. With taxpayers footing the bill for religious private schools, the separation of church and state, a cornerstone of American democracy, becomes a murky line. So how did it come to be that taxpayers are footing the bill for an evangelical education? Most states have little oversight on the curriculum used in schools that participate in private school choice programs. Some states have zero regulations on the topic. Others require private schools to follow the state۪s broad-based content standards but specify little else. (Rhode Island۪s stipulations appear the most strict: Curricula in private schools must be submitted and largely equivalent to what is taught in public schools.) Additionally, private schools that participate in these programs are not typically subject to the same accountability and transparency rules as public schools, although rules vary on a state-by-state basis. It is difficult to ascertain exactly how many students use taxpayer funds to attend schools with evangelical curricula, but we do know that over 400,000 students nationwide currently attend school using money from a voucher or tax credit program, according to the education reform group EdChoice . Some states are more transparent than others. In Indiana, about 4,240 students received over $16 million in scholarships to attend schools that use the Abeka or Bob Jones curriculum, according to 2016-2017 figures from the Indiana Department of Education. These numbers could soon grow. DeVos is an advocate of school choice and religious education. While she failed in her first attempt to push a federal private school choice program via the Education Department budget, she has repeatedly said she will not stop trying. The prospect of giving kids more access to these schools with public money is deeply upsetting to Bishop, who was recently diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of bullying and corporal punishment she experienced as a child. After leaving high school and getting a taste of the outside world, Bishop fell into a deep depression. When she went to job interviews, she had no idea what to say about the education she had received. What They Learned HuffPost spoke to nearly a dozen former students and teachers at schools that relied on Abeka, Bob Jones and Accelerated Christian Education curricula. Many of these students, who consider themselves no longer religious, reported feeling traumatized by their educational experiences. A number of them communicate with each other via online support groups for survivors of fundamentalist schools, including Bishop. Some say these curriculum sources left them woefully ill-equipped to thrive in a diverse society while instilling in them racist, sexist and intolerant views of the world. Bishop said her fundamentalist education made her wary of people from other religious groups whom her teachers and textbooks had demonized. Anything that wasn۪t Christianity was a strange religion,۝ said Bishop, who made it a priority to study other religious practices after high school and even spent time with the Hare Krishna. But even other denominations were evil. Catholicism especially.۝ Another former student who spoke to HuffPost under the pseudonym Natasha Balzak, was taught at home that all Muslims hate America, she said. Teachers at her Florida school reinforced this idea, telling students to pray for Muslims and other non-believers, like atheists and gay people. When it comes to hateful ideology and rhetoric, I was taught a lot of things to skew my mind into believing ۥ I guess you could call it brainwashing,۝ said Balzak, 27, who is using a pseudonym to protect the identity of family members who are still deeply involved in their church. Balzak recalled that her school, Coral Springs Christian Academy, used a mix of ACE and Abeka materials, but the head of the school said they were not aware of the school ever using ACE and that they currently used only Abeka in lower grades for phonics. The school participates in Florida۪s three private-school choice programs and currently enrolls 172 students on these scholarships. It received $554,418 in taxpayer-funded scholarships this year, according to a spokesperson for the Florida Department of Education. A HuffPost analysis of Abeka, Bob Jones and ACE textbooks confirms the recollections of these students. These materials inaccurately portray events in Muslim and Catholic history while perpetuating anti-Semitic stereotypes. The materials speak disparagingly of Native Americans and Native culture. The chart below details some of the inaccurate and biased perspectives in these textbooks compared with the perspective of an academic who studies these issues. A Bob Jones high school world history textbook portrays Islam as a violent religion and contains a title Islam and Murder.۝ In the same textbook, when describing the Catholic Reformation, Catholic leaders are described as failing to see that the root of their problems was doctrinal error.۝ When describing the concept of Manifest Destiny, the term used to describe America۪s 19th century expansion westward, an ACE textbook referred to the movement essentially as spreading the gospel: It was considered God۪s will that this vastly superior American culture should spread to all corners of the North American continent,۝ the passage reads. The benighted Indians would be among the many beneficiaries of God۪s provision.۝ David Brockman, an expert on world religions, was presented with passages from the Bob Jones and ACE textbooks. Most Protestants would likely disagree with the theological and historical narratives portrayed in the books, he said. The textbook simply distorts history,۝ wrote Brockman, a non-resident scholar at Rice University۪s Baker Institute for Public Policy, after examining the selections. And given the biblical command not to bear false witness, I would question whether a distorted history is consistent with Christian teaching.۝ When Balzak attended a secular college in 2009, it was a shock to the system, she said. In her first environmental science class, she learned about climate change ۥ a concept she had been taught was a hoax. When I took my first real science class, a million light bulbs went off,۝ said Balzak, who had only been taught creationism in school. Everything finally made sense.۝ The experience made Balzak feel robbed of a fact-based education. Indeed, Balzak۪s former school, Coral Springs Christian Academy, includes a statement of faith in its parent-student handbook, which is posted on its website: We believe God created the entire universe out of nothing.۝ The handbook also describes the school۪s attitude toward LGBTQ students. It says administrators will reject applicants or expel current students if they are caught living in, or condoning, or supporting any form of sexual immorality; practicing or promoting a homosexual lifestyle or alternative gender identity.۝ Coral Springs۪ head of school noted that the institution had likely changed a lot since Balzak attended some years ago, although he has worked at the school for only a few years. He said that staff members do not recall the school ever relying significantly on Abeka materials, and says that the student body has become significantly more diverse, It۪s a very different education I۪m sure than 20 years ago,۝ said head of school Joseph Sanelli. But in some ways, Balzak considered herself lucky. She said her childhood wasn۪t traumatic, just deeply imperfect. Bishop didn۪t have such luck. Some of the schools Bishop attended were worse than others. She faced the greatest difficulty from ages 11 to 13, when she attended Franklin Christian Academy in Georgia. The school appears to no longer be open, according to the Georgia Department of Education list of private schools, and a series of calls to what Bishop said was an affiliated church were not returned. The school consisted of three rooms, Bishop recalled, with most of the school۪s 30-something kids spending all day in the same classroom. The school relied on an Accelerated Christian Education curriculum currently used by at least nine private schools in Georgia that are eligible for taxpayer funds. ACE classrooms are uniquely designed. Students sit in cubicle-like offices, with barriers separating their desks. Teachers do not lead students in lessons or discussions. Instead, students spend all day silently sifting through a succession of readings and fill-in-the-blank worksheets. When students have a question, they raise either an American or Christian flag to get the attention of a class supervisor. A 2012 training manual for administrators obtained by HuffPost lists an education degree as a detriment۝ for the job. Indeed these supervisors۪ lack of qualifications was once the topic of a Judge Judy۝ episode about a decade ago. At Bishop۪s school, she dealt with intense physical bullying and verbal harassment. When she would complain about the harassment, school authorities told her to ignore it. They sometimes implied she was at fault and needed to get closer to Jesus, she said. The school did not employ professionals trained to deal with mental health issues, she added. As a teenager she went nearly mute and thought about killing herself. I didn۪t want to get out of bed. I did self-harm,۝ she said, speaking slowly and deliberately over coffee. I just hated myself and I didn۪t know what to do about it.۝ It was also around that time that Bishop realized she was attracted to other girls. She repressed her feelings for decades, even spending most of her 20s married to a man. An examination of ACE textbooks shows that its materials push strict ideas about gender roles and sexuality. Even now Bishop still sometimes finds herself shrinking in the presence of men, saying that it۪s almost like muscle memory.۝ Balzak echoes these sentiments, saying that even her female teachers reinforced the idea that women are secondary to men. When describing the 1920s, a high school ACE textbook criticizes women for wearing short skirts and cutting their hair, calling it a violation of Scripture. Before the 1920s, when women were less likely to work outside the home, they were comfortable to be discreet, chaste, keepers at house, good, obedient to their own husbands,۝ says the material. School, Bishop said, made her want to give up on education. She spent some time being home-schooled, then at another Georgia school before moving to Roxboro Christian School in North Carolina. After less than two years there ۥ in which she spent much of her time hiding in the bathroom ۥ she dropped out and got her GED. Roxboro currently participates in North Carolina۪s voucher program, and representatives there confirmed that Bishop was once enrolled. The school also confirmed that they use Abeka, Bob Jones and ACE. Roxboro has received over $8,000 this year in voucher program and currently enrolls four scholarship recipients, per a report from the North Carolina State Education Assistance Authority. Two other schools Bishop attended are also eligible to receive monetary assistance via school voucher or tax credit programs. Bishop attended Beaufort Christian School in South Carolina and Neuse Christian Academy in North Carolina as a child. Beaufort Christian Academy uses materials from Abeka and ACE, per its website. A representative from the school confirmed that Bishop was once enrolled. Neuse Christian Academy uses materials from Abeka and Bob Jones University, and it received $37,368 in scholarship money for 18 students, per the North Carolina Education Assistance Authority. The school was not able to confirm Bishop۪s enrollment because it does not still have its records from that time. How Did These Textbooks Come To Be? Abeka, Bob Jones University Press and Accelerated Christian Education started selling textbooks in the early 1970s, a few decades before Wisconsin enacted the nation۪s first voucher program. At the time, enrollment in fundamentalist Christian schools was booming. For one, recent Supreme Court decisions had banned school Bible readings and official school prayer. Groups of evangelical Protestants were alarmed. The founders of these textbook companies dedicated their lives to pushing fundamentalist viewpoints. Abeka leaders Arlin and Beka Horton also founded Pensacola Christian College in Florida, which outlaws dancing and other satanic practices.۝ They also founded Pensacola Christian Academy, a K-12 school that currently receives public funding for student scholarships via Florida۪s tax credit program. Bob Jones University Press is affiliated with Bob Jones University, which famously lost its tax-exempt status in 1983 after banning interracial dating, a policy it didn۪t reverse until 2000. Accelerated Christian Education was founded by Donald Howard, a Texas pastor. In his 1988 book, World Awakening,۝ Howard describes AIDS as a plague sent down by God intended to punish gay people and other idol worshippers, like feminists, prochoice, and Planned Parenthood advocates.۝ ACE, Abeka and Bob Jones University Press leaders have largely similar educational philosophies, with a few subtle differences. The leaders of all three companies subscribe to an authoritarian vision of education in which students are taught not to question their elders. While ACE۪s curriculum barely involves a teacher, Abeka۪s promotes the educator as an absolute authority, per research from Binghamton University professor Adam Laats. They all have come under fire for providing children with an inadequate education. Eleven separate reviews of the ACE program by experts and academics have repudiated the curriculum, according to research conducted by Jonny Scaramanga at University College London. A representative of ACE responded to one of these reviews from 1987. Our material is not written with conventional viewpoints in mind. We do not believe that education should be nondirective or speculative, or that the final interpretation of facts and events should be left up to immature inexperienced minds as mainline secular curricula do,۝ wrote a former ACE vice president at the time. The University of California system refuses to accept certain high school courses that rely on BJU and Abeka materials for credit. The Association of Christian Schools International sued the University of California System over this issue in 2005. A judge eventually ruled in favor of the UC System. Still, American taxpayers continue to indirectly prop up these curricula through voucher programs. It is unclear how the proliferation of private school choice programs has affected the bottom line for these textbook companies. Representatives of Bob Jones University Press did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Representatives of ACE did not respond to requests for comment either, however its website claims they are in 6,000 schools around the globe, although a number of experts told HuffPost that they are skeptical of this number. A spokesperson for Abeka noted that, while the company is aware its materials are used in private schools that receive public funding, Abeka does not advocate or encourage the use of state or federal funding for private, Christian schools.۝ We recognize that academic scholars have differing opinions on historical/scientific content and that this frequently occurs in both public and private educational institutions as reported in the media. We are confident that our content is accurate, age appropriate, and academically rigorous,۝ wrote Brent Phillips, assistant to the president for business affairs, via email. Educators Sound Off Educators who use or are familiar with these resources told HuffPost that not all schools who use them have a fundamentalist approach. Indeed, not all schools who use these curricula are deeply religious, and they are used in a range of Christian schools. They emphasize that the quality of these publishers۪ resources differ based on subject and grade level. Bishop said that, while her education did not equip me to get the most basic of jobs,۝ she praised the rigor of Abeka and Bob Jones vocabulary and reading comprehension lessons. (Below, a passage on slavery from an Accelerated Christian Education textbook) Dave Moore, executive director of Pittsburgh Urban Christian School in Pennsylvania, said that he does not use any materials provided by these sources but that Abeka has excellent elementary grammar resources.۝ Pittsburgh Urban Christian receives scholarship money through Pennsylvania۪s school tax credit program. I would still use it if we didn۪t already develop our own curriculum. It does such a good job of it,۝ said Moore of Abeka۪s elementary phonics and math resources. If his school decided to use Abeka materials, he would direct teachers to be on alert for propaganda, he said. We do the same thing with secular textbooks,۝ Moore said. Some educators told HuffPost they are happy with the education students receive with these resources. Stephen Lindahl, assistant director of Calumet Christian School in Griffith, Indiana, disagreed with characterizations of Abeka and Bob Jones University Press as pushing a far-right worldview. His school uses Abeka materials almost exclusively for elementary school and then a mix of Abeka and Bob Jones in some later grades. Abeka and Bob Jones and other biblically based curriculum try to approach academics from a biblical standpoint and from a moral, ethical view, which does not necessarily push any agenda outside of an understanding of God and who Christ is,۝ Lindahl said. He noted that secular textbooks, too, often come with a specific point of view. HuffPost also reached out to multiple national school-choice advocacy groups for their responses on our findings. None of them responded, even sometimes with weeks۪ notice. However, professors who have studied the curricula say they are dangerous tools for schools to wield. I want parents to know their children might be coming home with a book that looks like an ordinary textbook but the messages are not what people would ordinarily learn,۝ said Kathleen Wellman, a professor of history at Southern Methodist University who is working on a book about these publications. Many universities don۪t require history education, so for many Americans this will be their last exposure to history. And many students say they didn۪t realize at the time how thoroughly indoctrinated they were being.۝ Sometimes Bishop wonders what her life would have been like had she not attended evangelical schools. She tried taking online university courses once but dropped out after having trouble balancing academics with her job. She still thinks about trying college again from time to time but worries about the financial feasibility. (Below, a passage on evolution from an Accelerated Christian Education textbook) Growing up, her schools had never offered outlets for her interest in art or dance ۥ things that she maybe would have wanted to explore. The only thing she ever remembers wanting to do was perform, a far cry from her current job, working in the produce department of a grocery store. The only career paths presented to her revolved around the church. It would be kind of different if I was at a school that allowed me to head in a direction I wanted to go,۝ said Bishop, who lights up when talking about the dance classes she has taken as an adult. I didn۪t really get that chance.۝ Kaeli Subberwal contributed to this report. Data and graphics by Alissa Scheller. Animation by Isabella Carapella.

After Trump at a news conference said there was blame of both sides۝ for the violence, Scott told Vice News that the president۪s moral authority۝ had been compromised.۝ Trump is committed to working with [leaders of the black community] to bring the country together,۝ Sanders said on Wednesday. I think that۪s where we need to be focused, not on outrageous statements like۝ the one by Hill. Hill, who co-hosts ESPN۪s  SC6 ۝ with Michael Smith, lashed out at Trump in a series of Twitter posts on Monday, calling the president a white supremacist۝ unfit to serve in the White House. Donald Trump is a white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself w/ other white supremacists,۝ she tweeted. Hill went on to call Trump the most ignorant, offensive president of my lifetime,۝ and said his rise is the direct result of white supremacy. Period.۝ In a statement on Tuesday, ESPN said Hill۪s comments about Trump do not represent the position۝ of the cable network.ʉWe have addressed this with Jemele and she recognizes her actions were inappropriate,۝ the statement said. ESPN has taken heat in recent years from conservatives who say the network has stuck its nose in politics and pushed a liberal agenda.  ESPN۪s double standard shows when hosts speak out ,۝ read a Wednesday headline on Fox News. To make its point, Fox pointed to ESPN۪s firing of analyst and former professional baseball pitcher Curt Schilling in May 2016 over a demeaning anti-transgender Facebook post by him. The post, apparently in response to North Carolina۪s anti-LGBT bathroom law, included a meme showing a man dressed in revealing women۪s clothing. With it Schilling commented:  A man is a man no matter what they call themselves . I don۪t care what they are, who they sleep with, men۪s room was designed for the penis, women۪s not so much. Now you need laws telling us differently? Pathetic.۝ In a statement announcing Schilling۪s termination, ESPN said it was an inclusive company۝ and that his conduct was unacceptable.۝ Schilling had long made his conservative viewpoints known before the offending post. This article has been updated with Scott۪s meeting with Trump on Wednesday and details of Schilling۪s 2016 firing by ESPN."

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-weak-obamacare_us_597b7265e4b02a8434b645c1","WASHINGTON ۥ In the wee hours of Friday, while most Americans were sleeping, Donald Trump suffered the biggest political defeat of his presidency. Senate Republicans failed to repeal Obamacare ۥ again ۥ and this time, at least for now, they appear ready to throw in the towel. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) looked stunned as the vote went down, and set up a vote for a judicial nominee next week before gaveling out. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) issued a statement saying he۪s moving onto what he۪s wanted to do all along, tax reform. It leaves Trump in his weakest position yet. Six months into the job, he has failed to unify his party to pass their No. 1-priority issue, at a time when the GOP controls all of government. He۪s proven to be a terrible dealmaker. He۪s demonstrated that his grand promises to his base about repealing President Barack Obama۪s signature law were empty, and that he۪s more interested in showmanship than substance. The photo below from a May ceremony in the Rose Garden, when Trump took a premature victory lap with House Republicans after they passed their (now dead) bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, is already starting to feel like his very own Mission Accomplished۝ moment. As lawmakers prepare to head home for the month of August,the president still doesn۪t have a single major legislative accomplishment under his belt. His popularity is stuck at historic lows . And while it may seem far away, the 2018 elections are on lawmakers۪ minds and will increasingly drive how they vote, regardless of what Trump wants. Some conservative pundits are already saying Trump۪s presidency is cooked. This president cannot change,۝ Rick Tyler, former communications director to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), said Friday on NBC۪s Morning Joe.۝ And if you cannot change and you cannot become presidential, and you cannot convince the majority of the American people to enact some legislative agenda that he wants passed, his presidency legislatively is effectively over.۝ Part of Trump۪s problem is that he keeps burning bridges with the very people who are supposed to be his allies in policy-making: Republicans on Capitol Hill, who he۪s routinely thrown under buses and blamed for any failures. On Friday, in a series of tweets, he criticized Senate Republicans who voted against repealing Obamacare and ranted about the need to change the chamber۪s rules, which he still doesn۪t understand. He seems to think Obamacare repeal could have passed if the Senate only required 51 votes for its passage instead of 60. It couldn۪t even get 50 votes. But if there۪s one thing Trump claims to love, it۪s winning. And he۪s got a penchant for being able to cast anything as a win with the right framing.He could still eke out a win on health care if he put those skills to work, but it would mean redefining success and working with Democrats and the Republicans he۪s clashed with. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), one of Trump۪s biggest critics and one of the GOPers who voted against the Senate۪s repeal bill, said in a Friday statement that it۪s time for everyone to start fresh۝ and work on a bipartisan solution to fix Obamacare instead of repealing it. It is now time to return to regular order with input from all of our members  Republicans and Democrats  and bring a bill to the floor of the Senate for amendment and debate,۝ McCain said I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to trust each other, stop the political gamesmanship, and put the health care needs of the American people first. We can do this.۝ Is it possible for Trump to not attack McCain over his war hero status , or not accuse him of generally losing,۝ or not criticize his daughter for being angry and obnoxious۝ on television, long enough to get something done together on health care? A White House spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment."
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/juggalos-donald-trump-rally_us_59bd9754e4b02da0e1427777","Nine months into the administration of President Donald Trump , fans of the eccentric Detroit rap duo Insane Clown Posse assembled a larger rally on the national mall this Saturday than the president۪s diehard supporters stationed a few hundred yards away. The dueling rallies reflected the difficulty that any sitting president has in mobilizing his base, and the particular challenge that Trump has as he struggles to pass major legislation and honor his campaign promises. Unlike the pro-Trump rally, Juggalos, as clown-makeup-wearing Insane Clown Posse fans call themselves, protested on the National Mall on Saturday for an actual specific purpose. That could explain why the gathering that surrounded the base of the reflection pool at the Lincoln Memorial this afternoon was significantly larger than the pro-Trump rally. In 2011, the FBI۪s National Gang Intelligence Center designated Juggalos, who say they are simply fans of a band, as a loosely organized hybrid gang,۝ saying a subset of the group is involved in criminal activity. The agency sent out briefing materials to all law enforcement offices around the country listing Juggalos as a gang alongside Crips, Bloods and MS-13. They pointed out particular signs to look for to see if a person was a Juggalo, like the hatchet man۝ symbol of the Insane Clown Posse. The result was that people who counted themselves fans of Insane Clown Posse have been fired from their jobs, lost children in custody battles and were targeted and harassed by police. Kevin Gill, an employee for the band and host of a Juggalo podcast, gave the opening remarks, calling the rally, The most important day in Juggalo history.۝ This protest was some monumental shit,۝ he added, before ripping into a denunciation of the FBI for categorizing Juggalos as a gang. In response, the crowd broke into a raucous chant about the much-hated FBI, They fucked up! They fucked up!۝ Give us back our fucking civil rights,۝ Gill shouted. Gill and every other speaker at the Juggalo rally preached inclusivity with a passion that speakers at the pro-Trump rally reserved for subjects liker border security. We don۪t care if you۪re black, white, Hispanic, straight, gay, trans, fat as fuck or skinny as a broom stick,۝ Gill said, adding everyone is welcome to be or support Juggalos. This was largely the message from the Juggalos in attendance. At the core of it, it۪s just a battle cry against discrimination,۝ Christian Ike, a Juggalo who traveled from Los Angeles for the protest, told HuffPost. Obviously there۪s worse discrimination in this country than what the Juggalos are facing. But we۪re here to say that we۪re also with those people.۝ Jessica, a Juggalo from Arlington, Virginia, who declined to give her last name, told HuffPost, We۪re not a gang. We don۪t do that. We۪re about love and family.۝ I۪m tired of the FBI going around harassing people, pulling them over, people getting fired,۝ Kev aka Juggs۝ from the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, said. Four speakers recounted the ways that their lives have been negatively impacted by the FBI۪s designation of Juggalos as a gang. New Mexico resident Crystal Guerrero said that she lost custody of two children because she went to one Insane Clown Posse show. Laura King of Fredericksburg, Virginia, recounted how she was permanently placed on a gang registry while she was on probation for a DUI offense because she had a tattoo of the hatchet man symbol. Jessica Bonometti was fired from her job as a probation officer in Woodbridge, Virginia, because she liked some Insane Clown Posse-related photographs on Facebook. Zac, a Juggalo from Utah County, Utah, wearing a bright orange suit while holding the Utah state flag, told HuffPost that he had been harassed numerous times by police and private security just for wearing Insane Clown Posse T-shirts and having bumper stickers on his car. He said that he doesn۪t wear the clothes or decorate his car the way he۪d like to because it makes him a target. I do not support Insane Clown Posse the way I normally would and I feel that it۪s in violation of my rights as an American to support a band and that۪s why I۪m here,۝ he said. Further east on the mall, closer to the U.S. Capitol building, pro-Trump activists had convened the Mother of All Rallies,۝ to help send a message to Congress, the media and the world: we stand united to defend American culture and values.۝ As it turned out, the self-described Woodstock of American rallies,۝ drew just a few hundred people, leaving much of the enclosed grass area allotted to the group empty for the duration of the afternoon. The lineup of speakers consisted mainly of D-list conservative leaders like Marco Gutierrez, the founder of Latinos for Trump, who famously warned that if the country did not curb immigration there would be taco trucks on every corner.۝ No Republican members of Congress or elected officials of any major office were there. The rally organizers made a point of condemning racism on their website , advising attendees, in all caps, NO CONFEDERATE FLAGS, NO COMMUNIST FLAGS, NO FOREIGN FLAGS ALLOWED.۝ It was not clear if the members of the Oathkeepers and other right-wing militiamen in khaki tactical vests at the perimeter of the rally strictly enforced this dictum. But for the most part, the gathering appeared to be free of Confederate flags or overtly white supremacist paraphernalia of the kind on display at the clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August. Jacob Boslet, a 19-year-old from Altoona, Pennsylvania, was waving a Kekistan۝ flag popular on the alt-right that resembles a particular version of the Nazi flag. Boslet, whose brother was attending the Juggalo rally, claimed that he was waving the flag to make a statement in support of free speech,۝ not white nationalism, which he condemns. This is to promote the idea that you can create your own entity regardless if it offends someone or not, or someone has already taken it. Look at it ۥ it looks stupid and is a joke,۝ Boslet said. There were flashes of the tensions that have flared up between either white supremacists or Trump supporters and left-leaning counterprotesters. Outside the rally perimeter, a group of self-described antifascists۝ or Antifa members, some of whom concealed their faces with black bandanas, got into heated political arguments with rally attendees. As the friction increased, U.S. Park Police officers got between the two groups, in an attempt to prevent violence. In short, it was a classic Make America Great Again۝ rally reminiscent of those that buoyed Trump۪s campaign ۥ save for the fact that it lacked both Trump and the throngs of supporters that flocked to him on the campaign trail. At one point, a speaker even got the crowd into a chant of Lock her up,۝ the campaign-trail mantra about then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton . Asked about Trump۪s stumbles, including the failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act, rally-goers universally blamed congressional Democrats and Trump۪s Republican critics like Sens. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and John McCain (Ariz.). For the most part, they were not even especially perturbed by Trump۪s apparent willingness to help undocumented immigrants who arrived as children stay in the country. I don۪t really think that people want everyone who came here illegally deported because some of them are trying to build a future for themselves and a future for their country,۝ Boslet said. In many ways, the ralliers reflected the more independent nature of Trump۪s fan base. Few if any attendees who spoke to Huffpost identified as Republicans. Jennifer McGarrity, a 43-year-old sales manager, who drove down from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to show support for the president, identified as a pro-choice۝ independent.She was unfazed by Trump۪s increased willingness to forge agreements with congressional Democrats. He knows how to get the deal done when he wants his agenda to pass through so he۪ll talk to who he has to,۝ she said. More than one rally attendee said that their only disappointment in Trump was his willingness to intervene militarily in foreign countries. I۪m disappointed that he wants to be a war president. Instead of going toward a route of peace, he wants to wage war whether it be in Syria or North Korea,۝ said Manny Vega, a 32-year-old truck driver from Richmond, Virginia, who served four tours in Iraq with the Marines. Vega is especially concerned about the length of the war in Afghanistan, which has lasted nearly 16 years. He noted that the young children of veterans who fought at the beginning of the Afghanistan War are now eligible to serve in it. It۪s a real sad situation where father and son are fighting the same war,۝ he said."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-new-york-times-interview_us_59700842e4b0110cb3cb9745","In an interview with The New York Times published Wednesday, President Donald Trump made a series of shocking statements about his administration۪s ties to Russia, ongoing investigations into collusion with a foreign government and his waning happiness with senior officials in the White House . Here are some of the most eyebrow-raising passages from the exclusive sit-down: You can read the Times۪ full story here and excerpts from their interview here Trump would not have appointed Attorney General Jeff Sessions if he۪d known he would recuse himself from the Russia probe.  Jeff Sessions takes the job, gets into the job, recuses himself. I then have ۥ which, frankly, I think is very unfair to the president. How do you take a job and then recuse yourself? If he would have recused himself before the job, I would have said, Thanks, Jeff, but I can۪t, you know, I۪m not going to take you.۪ It۪s extremely unfair, and that۪s a mild word, to the president.۝ Sessions recused himself from any future investigations into Russian influence on the 2016 presidential campaign after The Washington Post reported he had met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak twice last year and failed to disclose the meetings. He had previously told the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath he had not had any communications with the Russians۝ during the presidential campaign, which he participated in as a Trump surrogate. Trump said the office of special counsel Robert Mueller is full of conflicts of interest. He was up here and he wanted the job,۝ Mr. Trump said. After he was named special counsel, I said, What the hell is this all about?۪ Talk about conflicts. But he was interviewing for the job. There were many other conflicts that I haven۪t said, but I will at some point.۝ When Mueller was chosen to lead the Justice Department۪s probe into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, he garnered widespread praise from both sides of the aisle and was championed as an investigator with  sterling credentials .۝ However, Trump implies that Mueller may have had a conflict of interest because he was on a shortlist to replace fired FBI Director James Comey . When he was named special counsel, Trump۪s surrogates quickly began work to undercut Mueller۪s integrity , saying they questioned his impartiality due to his longtime friendship with Comey. News outlets the president is known to follow, including Fox News and InfoWars, have continued to cast doubt on the investigation, labeling it with a favorite phrase of Trump۪s: a witch hunt.۝ The president claimed his second, previously undisclosed meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin lasted 15 minutes and adoption۝ came up. The meal was going, and toward dessert I went down just to say hello to Melania, and while I was there I said hello to Putin. Really, pleasantries more than anything else. It was not a long conversation, but it was, you know, could be 15 minutes. Just talked about ۥ things. Actually, it was very interesting, we talked about adoption.۝ The White House acknowledged Tuesday that Trump held a second, private conversation with Putin at the G-20 summit in Germany earlier this month. According to Ian Bremmer, the president of a consulting firm called the Eurasia Group, the talk lasted for about an hour and the only other person in on the conversation was a Kremlin interpreter. Bremmer told the Times that guests at the dinner where the interaction occurred were confused۝ and flummoxed۝ by it. Never in my life as a political scientist have I seen two countries ۥ major countries ۥ with a constellation of national interests that are as dissonant while the two leaders seem to be doing everything possible to make nice and be close to each other,۝ Bremmer told Bloomberg۪s Charlie Rose . The White House disputed the characterization of the talk as a meeting۝ and said it lasted a short while. It was pleasantries and small talk,۝ White House spokesman Sean Spicer said. Trump accused Comey, whom he abruptly fired in May, of using an unverified dossier of compromising material to keep his job. In my opinion, he shared it so that I would think he had it out there,۝ Mr. Trump said. As leverage? Yeah, I think so,۝ Mr. Trump said. In retrospect.۝ The president dismissed the assertions in the dossier: When he brought it to me, I said this is really, made-up junk. I didn۪t think about any of it. I just thought about, man, this is such a phony deal.۝ According to his testimony last month to the Senate Intelligence Committee, Comey first informed Trump about the existence of the dossier ۥ compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele ۥ in January after U.S. intelligence agents decided he should be told before anything was published by the media. Comey said the president again denied anything alleged in the document was accurate during a private dinner later that month and urged the then-director to investigate the material. I replied that he should give that careful thought because it might create a narrative that we were investigating him personally, which we weren۪t, and because it was very difficult to prove a negative,۝ Comey said in his prepared remarks . He said he would think about it and asked me to think about it.۝ The president once more denied the allegations in a call in late March, saying he had not been involved with hookers in Russia,۝ Comey recalled. Mueller would cross a red line۝ if he looked into the Trump family۪s finances beyond Russia. If Mueller was looking at your finances and your family finances, unrelated to Russia  is that a red line?۝ I would say yeah. I would say yes.۝ As the Times reports, Trump did not say if he would consider firing Mueller, noting, I can۪t answer that question because I don۪t think it۪s going to happen.۝ Only the deputy attorney general who appointed the special counsel can directly fire him (that would be Rod Rosenstein, who is in charge of such decisions as Sessions has recused himself). However, Trump could fire Rosenstein and, as Politico reports,  continue down the line until a DOJ official acquiesced.۝ Trump complained about Rosenstein, describing him as a man Sessions hardly knew۝ and alluding that he was annoyed the deputy attorney general was from Baltimore.۝ I said, Who۪s your deputy?۪ So his deputy he hardly knew, and that۪s Rosenstein, Rod Rosenstein, who is from Baltimore. There are very few Republicans in Baltimore, if any. So, he۪s from Baltimore.۝ Rosenstein was born in Philadelphia and lived in Bethesda, Maryland ,when he was U.S. attorney for the state. He has been described as the  poster child for the professional , competent, ethical and fair-minded prosecutor,۝ and he told The Baltimore Sun in April he was ready to take up the No. 2 job at the Justice Department without regard to partisan political consideration.۝ Rosenstein made headlines earlier this year after a memo he drafted about Comey was cited by the president as his reasoning for firing the FBI director. In the document, Rosenstein criticized Comey۪s handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, but the deputy attorney general reportedly threatened to quit after he was painted by the White House as the driving force behind the dismissal of Comey. His nomination earned bipartisan support, and the Senate voted 94-6 to confirm him."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-arizona-rally_us_599cf690e4b0a296083adeee","President Donald Trump blasted the media, criticized members of Congress and suggested he۪d shut down the government to build a border wall during a frenzied, 77-minute campaign-style rally in Phoenix on Tuesday night that left some commentators wondering about his fitness for office. Trump is known for his lively rallies, but even by those standards this one was a particularly unrestrained and boisterous spectacle. Here is a breakdown of some of the wildest moments. 1. He kicked off the speech by rereading all his responses to the protests in Charlottesville. While going over his widely criticized initial response, Trump omitted the most controversial part of the statement , in which he blamed  many sides ۝ for the violence there. 2. He called out Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). We have to speak to Mitch۝ about eliminating the Senate filibuster, Trump said. (The filibuster was not a factor in stopping the Republican health care bill.) Earlier on Tuesday, The New York Times reported that Trump and McConnell have not spoken in weeks. 3. He suggested he۪d shut down the government if it meant he could get a wall built along the U.S.-Mexico border. If we have to shut down that government, we۪re building that wall,۝ Trump said.ʉOne way or another, we۪re going to get that wall.۝ 4. He argued the media are trying to take away our history, our heritage.۝ The only thing giving a platform to these hate groups is the media itself and the fake news,۝ Trump said. I really think they don۪t like our country. I really believe that,۝ he added. 5. He defended his remarks on Charlottesville by saying he hit۝ various racist groups. I hit ۪em with neo-Nazi, I hit ۪em with everything,۝ he said. I got the white supremacist, I got the neo-Nazi, I got ۪em all in there. Let۪s see. KKK? We have KKK. I got ۪em all.۝ 6. He lied and said cameras at the rally were being turned off as live-streams of the speech on cable news networks continued to roll. He specifically called out CNN, which aired Trump۪s speech until the end. 7. He teased a pardon for Joe Arpaio , the former sheriff of Maricopa County who was convicted of criminal contempt. 8. He bragged about how he lives in a bigger, more beautiful apartment۝ than the journalists who cover him. 9. He lamented CNN۪s firing of Jeffrey Lord , a pro-Trump commentator formerly featured on the network.Lord was fired for tweeting the Nazi salute Sieg Heil۝ earlier in August. 10. He slammed both Republican Arizona senators: Jeff Flake, who has recently spoken out against Trump , and John McCain, who cast a pivotal vote that caused the GOP۪s Obamacare repeal bill to flame out in the Senate in July. McCain is currently receiving treatment for brain cancer. 11. He, again, requested statues of George Washington be protected , a request he۪s made since many Confederate statues and monuments around the U.S. have been removed or relocated . 12. He suggested we will probably end up terminating NAFTA at some point.۝ 13. He praised Fox News and Sean Hannity."

She wrote that it was impossible to sit across from corporate representatives and demand a basic standard of behavior that is not being enforced in the White House. Trying to hold companies to standards that our current administration is not living up to was creating a cognitive dissonance that I could not overcome,۝ Chen wrote in her post, which was first reported by the International Business Times .

But if God did take the wheel Tuesday night, she was already on Interstate 65, hightailing it to Birmingham to kick it with election winner Doug Jones. Jones۪ victory party would undoubtedly be more gracious than Moore۪s sullen affair, with its tiny white-bread sandwich slivers and where a saxophone cover of Carlos Santana۪s Smooth۝ served as the night۪s only respite. No sooner had the election map turned blue than the Republicans at this party began to point fingers. There۪s blood in the water for Mitch McConnell, it leads back to him. This room is gonna be walking out with a vengeance. We know who۪s responsible,۝said Chanel Rion, the 27-year-old fiancee of Missouri Senate candidate Courtland Sykes. Sykes himself was even more fire-and-brimstone, worried that establishment Republicans ۥ not Democrats ۥ were winning the war against MAGA candidates,۝ a shorthand for President Donald Trump۪s make America great again۝campaign slogan. This is impossible. This is 100-percent an effort by the Washington establishment to keep Roy Moore out of it,۝Sykes told HuffPost. If they can put a Democrat in office in Alabama, in 2017, to replace Jeff Sessions, even after Donald Trump won by a landslide in 2016, that means they can replace anyone they want. We don۪t have an honest republic if this can happen. Does that make sense?۝ Others pointed to Alabama۪s senior senator, Republican Richard Shelby, who on Sunday admitted he didn۪t vote for Moore and said the Republican Party can do better.۝ One Moore supporter was overheard saying he۪d like to find an establishment Republican like Shelby to punch in the face۝ for involvement in Moore۪s downfall. Then there was Trump, who threw his support to Moore after backing his GOP opponent during the primary. Trump is now 0-for-2 in his Alabama endorsements. What didn۪t help is Republicans jumping ship during Roy Moore۪s greatest time of need,۝ said Ben Smith, 25, a conservative University of Alabama student. That destroyed any party unity we had left ... I۪m kind of just numb right now.۝ Of course, no fingers were pointed in the direction of Moore himself, despite allegations that he sexually assaulted a child and harassed others. Nobody pointed at Moore, who ran for office after being defrocked as a judge ۥ twice ۥ for disrespecting federal law in favor of his God-and-country platform. Not one supporter we spoke to cast blame on the ex-judge from Gallant, who used to sign Bibles at his courthouse. Moore gave a short, stuttering speech before he left on Tuesday ۥ an uncomfortable bookend to an awkward 24 hours. The night before, his wife Kayla bragged that the couple weren۪t anti-Semitic because one of our attorneys is a Jew.۝ Then, one of Moore۪s old war buddies said the pals accidentally stumbled into a brothel together that was full of very young۝ women. On Tuesday morning in Gallant, Moore and his horse Sassy were effectively chased out of his own polling center by a throng of reporters desperate for quotes about a possible ethics violation should he win. Nobody at his party had expected a loss like this. There were rumblings of discontent well before the ex-judge faced allegations of sexual assault. Republicans at his own events had previously said they disliked him ; conservative Christians said they didn۪t trust him . After women began coming forward to describe how Moore pursued them as teens when he was in his 30s,lawyers and cops said they didn۪t have the evidence at the time to throw the book at him. In any case, Moore is gone for a while, along with the horse he rode in on . It leaves Democrats with a rare opportunity for a one-two punch. A few blocks from Moore۪s gathering, near the steps of the state capitol, some Jones supporters were at a bar celebrating, and plotting to flip more Alabama elections blue.Tabitha Isner ۥ who۪s running for the state۪s 2nd Congressional District, currently represented by Republican Rep.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joe-biden-2020-harvey-weinstein_us_5a0a0ba8e4b00a6eece3a13e","Joe Biden is a man looking for his moment. Behind those famous aviators, he۪s surveying the landscape to see if 2020 might just be his year to fulfill his presidential dreams. Biden has already run for president twice. Although he didn۪t run in 2016, he thinks he could have won that race. When Hillary Clinton lost, she was heavily criticized for not having a populist economic message that could have reached the working-class white voters who swung over to Donald Trump. Those voters are the speciality of the former vice president, who was born in the Rust Belt city of Scranton, Pennsylvania. When he represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate, Biden was known for taking Amtrak to and from Washington, just like the regular people. Biden is now wondering if 2020 may be his time.  I۪m not closing the door . I۪ve been around too long and I۪m a great respecter of fate, but who knows what the situation is going to be a year and a half from now,۝ he said Tuesday. According to Politico, Biden has also privately been telling people that as of now, he doesn۪t see anyone besides himself who could stop Trump from winning a second term. But 2020 may not be Biden۪s year. While he is better than many other Democrats at offering up economic populism, there are other rising movements for which he isn۪t well positioned to be the face of the party. Clinton lost. And with her defeat went many people۪s hope that the nation would finally have its first female president. Afterward, women ۥ some of whom had supported Clinton and some who did not ۥ launched a resistance movement to push back on Trump۪s policies and get more politically engaged. Record numbers of women are now running for office. The movement has extended beyond politics. Men in entertainment, media, business and other areas are finally being held accountable for sexist behavior. From former Fox News host Bill O۪Reilly to producer Harvey Weinstein to comedian Louis C.K., men are losing their jobs after years of having sexually harassed or assaulted women with impunity. Biden is the wrong guy to bear the standard of any party purporting to speak for the victims of unaccountable power. In many ways, Anita Hill launched the movement against sexual harassment in 1991. Then a 35-year-old law professor, she publicly accused Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of having sexually harassed her when she worked for him. She faced a Senate Judiciary Committee composed entirely of white men. Although the Senate went on to confirm Thomas anyway, women around the country were captivated by her testimony. For the first time on national television, a woman was describing what so many of them faced every day in their jobs. I۪ve seen movements come and go. And some are quite powerful. I۪ve not seen something like this. And I۪m hoping that[it will] bring lasting change,۝ Hill told CNN last week on the progress that has been made since her testimony. Hill has previously said she doesn۪t believe her allegations against Thomas received the consideration they deserved. There were other women who were ready to support her allegations, but they were never allowed to testify before the Judiciary Committee. The man who could have changed that was Biden, who served as chair of the committee in 1991. In the years since,he has publicly presented himself as Hill۪s ally , but she made clear in an interview with HuffPost in 2014 that she believes the senator let her down. There were three women who were ready and waiting and subpoenaed to be giving testimony about similar behavior that they had experienced or witnessed. He failed to call them ,۝Hill said. There also were experts who could have given real information as opposed to the misinformation that the Senate was giving ... and helped the public understand sexual harassment. He failed to call them.۝ Biden told The New York Times two days before Hill was set to testify that he began by assuming that Thomas was innocent ۥ and, as it follows, by assuming that Hill was lying. I must start off with a presumption of giving the person accused the benefit of the doubt ,۝ Biden said. I must seek the truth and I must ask straightforward and tough questions, and in my heart I know if that woman is telling the truth it will be almost unfair to her. On the other hand, if I don۪t ask legitimate questions, then I am doing a great injustice to someone who might be totally innocent. It۪s a horrible dilemma because you have two lives at stake here.۝ Since that time, Biden has built a long record of championing women۪s rights. As vice president, he sought to address the scourge of sexual assault on college campuses and fought to make the matter a priority in the Obama administration. But part of his record remains the way he treated Hill. And for that, he has never fully apologized. Instead, on Monday, he said he felt bad that Hill felt she had been mistreated ۥ but he still insisted he was her champion. I feel really badly that she didn۪t feel like the process worked, but I tell you what, I said something at the time that proved to be right,۝Biden said. I said this is going to be the start of a fundamental change of what constitutes harassment in the workplace and people are going to begin to change.۝ Biden was correct. But it was in large part because of the way Hill was treated and the way he handled the hearing that people started talking. Women saw Hill go up against the white men on the Senate Judiciary Committee ۥ who were either unsympathetic to what she had gone through or simply didn۪t come to her assistance ۥ and decided that they needed to change the face of Congress. In response, a record number of women ran for Congress in 1992. And two new female senators finally took seats on the Judiciary Committee ۥ but not without a misstep by Biden . After then-Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) won her party۪s Senate primary, the chairman hand-delivered to her a dozen red roses with the note,  Welcome to the Senate Judiciary Committee .۝ News reports at the time described the moment in highly gendered language ۥ that Biden had tried to woo۝ Boxer but was scorned۝ and that Biden had gone  courting ۝ while the new female senators played hard to get.۝ Boxer ultimately chose not to join the committee. Biden also continues to maintain ۥ as he did in his remarks Monday ۥ that he wanted the other women to testify on behalf of Hill. He claimed that they didn۪t want to do so and that they would have undercut Hill۪s testimony. That is not, however, the version of events that Hill and her legal team remember , as HuffPost has reported. They believe that Biden, like the other senators at the time, simply wanted to finish up Thomas۪ confirmation hearing and move on ۥ even if it meant Hill would get the short end of the stick. Today, part of Biden۪s schtick is that he۪s Uncle Joe. He۪s the jovial guy who can go into a bar and connect with anyone there. During the Obama administration, his ability to glad-hand and connect with people in an entertaining way was on full display every two years when he greeted the new senators and their families as they were sworn in. He۪d schmooze and make jokes with little kids and elderly relatives alike. His behavior also had more patronizing undercurrents.A big part of his act was remarking on the attractiveness of women, young and old. He would comment on how pretty young women were and warn their fathers to keep the guys away. Many people found this behavior charming.He wasn۪t stiff like some politicians. He grabbed people۪s hands, put his arm around them and even kissed people on the cheek. But it۪s clear some people were uncomfortable. The teenage daughter of Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), for example, visibly cringed and pulled away when Biden whispered in her ear and kissed her on the head. In 2015, when Biden put his arms on the wife of Defense Secretary Ash Carter at Carter۪s swearing-in ceremony, people noticed how uncomfortable the moment looked. There are plenty of other examples. New York Magazine even had a slideshow of them called  9 Times Joe Biden Creepily Whispered in Women۪s Ears .۝ In 2015, conservative columnist Byron York wrote about Biden۪s handsy ways,questioning whether his gestures were appropriate . Do the incidents add up to anything? Assume that all of Biden۪s gestures were entirely innocent, just Joe being Joe,۝ York wrote. Still, in today۪s society, sexual harassment complaints have been lodged for less. Biden۪s behavior gives critics plenty of ammunition and puts supporters in a difficult position. Why is that kind of stuff OK when the vice president does it and cringe-making when it۪s the overly-friendly guy in the office?۝ Biden has clearly been a champion for women۪s rights in his policies. Even advocates who criticized his conduct during the Hill testimony say he is today one of their strongest allies . He has evolved ۥ but so have his party and the country. And the newly energized women under the Democratic tent may not want a relic from the pre-woke era to be their standard-bearer."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-health-insurance-cost_us_597042f3e4b062ea5f8f2430","President Donald Trump ۪s interview with The New York Times generated plenty of headline-making comments .But his remarks on health insurance, the biggest topic of the week, suggested he didn۪t know how it works or how much it costs. He said: So pre-existing conditions are a tough deal. Because you are basically saying from the moment the insurance, you۪re 21 years old, you start working and you۪re paying $12 a year for insurance, and by the time you۪re 70, you get a nice plan.۝ The notion of paying $12 a year for health insurance is even less than the $ 15 per month number Trump floated in an interview with the Economist earlier this year. Insurance is, you۪re 20 years old, you just graduated from college, and you start paying $15 a month for the rest of your life and by the time you۪re 70, and you really need it, you۪re still paying the same amount and that۪s really insurance,۝ he said in the May interview. The average premium for a single person who gets health benefits from an employer last year was $536 a month , with employees paying an average of 18 percent of the cost while employers pick up the rest, according to data from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Education Trust. Prices are different in the market for people who don۪t get health benefits from an employer or a government program ۥ including those who purchase policies directly, through a broker or a health insurance exchange. For consumers in this health insurance market, the average monthly unsubsidized premium a mid-level Silver۝ plan ranges from$364.91 for a 30-year-old to$872.01 for a 60-year-old, according to data compiled by HealthPocket. All of those numbers, of course, are significantly higher than either figure suggested by the president. This prompted a number of observers to wonder if Trump was confusing health insurance with the life insurance ads that air in heavy rotation on cable news. This article has been updated with additional data on average health insurance costs. Jeffrey Young contributed reporting."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-the-fast-food-president_us_598344d9e4b0fa1575fc6830","Donald Trump loves fast food . The 45th president has no problem wolfing down a Quarter Pounder or digging his way through a bucket of KFC. ۝ Great stuff ,۝ he once called the cheap, greasy fare. Six months into Trump۪s presidency, the fast-food industry has plenty of reason to love him back. The oil and gas sector, coal producers and for-profit colleges are all clear winners in the Trump team۪s mission to deconstruct the administrative state . But so far, fast food, retail and other lower-wage industries have benefited as much as anyone from the administration۪s great regulatory rollback. Lobbyists for restaurants, hotels and other franchised businesses spent the last several years fighting the Obama administration on one regulation after another. But the new White House occupant has heard their grievances, making industry-friendly changes to employment laws and how they۪re enforced. That۪s included abandoning Obama۪s overtime reforms, shying away from a minimum wage raise, and limiting who۪s considered an employer۝ under the law ۥ all of which have a disproportionate effect on lower-wage, labor-intensive fields like fast food. All told, the new administration has given McDonald۪s and its friends plenty to cheer about. The early signs are that it can be more like night and day in terms of approach,۝ said Matt Haller, senior vice president at the International Franchise Association, an industry group representing franchisers, including McDonald۪s. We just want regulations that are fair and reasonable and very clear.۝ The previous White House viewed regulation as a means to lift up workers at the bottom of the economic ladder, particularly folks doing low-paid service work like fast food and hospitality. Hence their push for a higher mandated wage floor, expanded overtime protections and aggressive enforcement of wage and hour laws. Like Obama, Trump speaks often of forgotten workers whose pay has stagnated, but so far his prescription for improving their lot mainly involves unfettering their employers. That shouldn۪t come as a surprise for a president who made his fortune in hotels and went on to nominate a burger chain executive to be the country۪s top workplace watchdog. (Andrew Puzder, the former CEO of Hardee۪s and Carl۪s Jr., ended up withdrawing his controversial nomination.) Still, the degree to which the administration is taking the reins off employers has distressed past officials who took a more aggressive tack. It۪s the combination of these policies that۪s deeply troubling,۝ said David Weil, who led the Labor Department۪s Wage and Hour Division under Obama. I see very little evidence that they are doing anything to address the needs of working people who have been left behind for a long time.۝ While he was in office, Weil tried to steer the agency۪s investigations toward the industries where he saw the most vulnerable workers ۥ fast food, sit-down restaurants, hotels and motels, janitorial companies and so forth. A Labor Department spokesman said the agency under Trump still carries out what it calls targeted enforcement۝ programs. But pressed on whether they were targeting the same low-wage fields as before, the spokesman declined to say. Some of the changes under Trump have little practical impact, but speak volumes about the administration۪s peculiar form of populism. Employers in food and hospitality were apoplectic over the Obama administration۪s view on joint employment۝ : the idea that more than one entity might be responsible when a worker gets injured or shorted on pay. The Obama administration put companies on notice that they, too, could be responsible for abuses against workers who are technically employed by temp firms and contractors. Fast-food brands like McDonald۪s recoiled at the idea they might be as liable for workplace violations as the franchisees who operate McDonald۪s restaurants. After Trump۪s second pick for labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, assumed office in April, one of the first steps the agency took was to rescind the guidance on joint employment issued under Obama. Speaking to a retail lobby last month, Vice President Mike Pence proudly noted the change , drawing applause. In another early move, the Labor Department brought back what are known as opinion letters.۝ When employers are sued for allegedly not paying overtime or the minimum wage, they can ask the Labor Department to pen one of these letters in their defense, to be used in court. Weil likens them to a get-out-of-jail-free card۝ for employers, and the Obama administration did not issue them. Trump۪s Labor Department, however, has trumpeted their return . Trump also rescinded an executive order from Obama that would have made it harder for firms to secure federal contracts if they have a documented history of wage theft. Obama۪s order was the result of a campaign by fast-food workers who had been shorted on their pay while working on federal properties. (Two other orders from Obama ۥ one raising the minimum wage for federal contractors and another mandating sick leave for themʉۥ have so far survived this administration.) Other changes on the employment front are far more significant. The Obama administration tried to reform the nation۪s overtime rules and guarantee more workers time and a half pay when they work more than 40 hours in a week. The share of salaried employees who are protected by overtime law has dropped off a cliff since the 1970s. The changes the Obama administration made would have extended overtime rights to 4 million additional workers, according to the previous White House. After business groups sued to stop Obama۪s plan, the Trump White House declined to defend it . The new administration seems to share the view of business groups that Obama۪s proposal covered too many workers and was too costly for employers. If Trump takes his own crack at overtime reform, it۪s likely he۪ll make far fewer workers eligible for time and a half pay. Many of the people Obama۪s reforms aimed to help work in food and retail jobs, earning relatively low salaries while clocking long days. A group of Chipotle workers recently sued the burrito chain for backpay, arguing Obama۪s overtime changes should still apply even though the rule is now in legal limbo. The case hasn۪t yet been decided. As with the overtime expansion, this White House has abandoned the push for a higher minimum wage made by Obama. The idea of hiking the minimum wage tends to poll well across party lines; although he flip-flopped on the issue as a candidate, Trump once said he would like to raise it to at least $10.۝ But so far as president, he seems intent to leave such matters to the market. The federal minimum wage, which prevails in any state without a higher one, is currently $7.25 per hour and hasn۪t been raised in eight years. Beyond the major policy shifts, Trump۪s effect on low-wage work will be felt in less obvious ways. He recently made two nominations to the five-member National Labor Relations Board, which interprets collective bargaining law and referees disputes between employers and unions. His conservative choices ۥ one is a management-side attorney, the other a former GOP staffer who served on the House labor committee ۥ would end the current liberal majority and push the board to the right. (One of them has already been confirmed.) If history is any indication, the Republican board would likely reverse some union-friendly rulings and draw tighter boundaries around who۪s eligible to unionize. Celine McNicholas, a labor policy expert at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said the board is one way Trump could chip away at what she considered modest gains made for lower-income workers during the Obama years. These potential setbacks are going to prove to be incredibly damaging, particularly for folks who are low-wage workers,۝ McNicholas said. They are certainly losers under the Trump administration.۝ One potential beneficiary of the new board is McDonald۪s. The fast-food giant recently went to trial before an administrative law judge at the labor board to determine whether it counts as a joint employer alongside its franchisees; McDonald۪s could be held jointly responsible for violating workers۪ rights. In general, a conservative labor board would be more likely to side with employers in such contentious cases. The board۪s general counsel, Richard Griffin, who functions as a quasi-prosecutor, brought the case against McDonald۪s on behalf of workers who claimed they۪d been illegally retaliated against for their activism in the Fight for $15 protests. A former union lawyer, Griffin assumed the post in 2013 and has been a thorn in the side of not just McDonald۪s but also Walmart and other employers he۪s taken to trial. His aggressive tenure has so infuriated business groups that some Republicans have demanded that he step down. But at this point, that would no longer be necessary. Griffin۪s four-year term expires in November. It will be up to Trump to choose his replacement."

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hurricane-harvey-texas-republicans-sandy-hypocrisy_us_59a46fcce4b041393a1fc43a","WASHINGTON ۥ Texas Republicans, long accustomed to bashing the federal government, are already changing their tune now that Hurricane Harvey has devastated parts of their state. An emergency aid package hasn۪t surfaced yet, but Congress almost certainly will have to approve a spending bill to help those affected by the hurricane-force winds and widespread flooding in southeastern Texas. The question is whether that money will be offset by cuts to other government programs, whether extraneous spending will be attached to the package, and whether, under any circumstances, Texas Republicans will have a problem voting for it. Money to help those in need from a lawmaker۪s homestate isn۪t a particularly tough vote. At this point, no Texas Republican has declared any sort of condition for their support of an emergency aid package. But when it was New York and New Jersey hit hard by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, all but one Texas Republican in Congress ۥ Rep. John Culberson ۥ voted against a $50.5 billion package to help people in those states. That was no surprise. The Texas delegation tends to speak with one voice , and there۪s little political repercussions for its members to vote against government largesse for another state. Many Republicans at the time said they took issue with unrelated spending that was attached to the Sandy bill, though most of the funding was directed at helping the storm۪s victims. And even some of the most derided provisions ۥ like $2 million to repair Smithsonian roofs in Washington ۥ were, in fact, related to that storm (it brought heavy wind and rain to that nation۪s capital, as well.) Overall, according to an analysis of the legislation compiled by CQ, the Sandy aid bill included $16 billion for community development programs, $11.5 billion for FEMA۪s disaster relief fund, $10.9 billion for transportation system repairs, $5.4 billion for Army Corps of Engineers projects, $800 million for social service programs, and $826 million for repairs to national parks and facilities. But Texas Republicans latched onto the notion that the Sandy relief package was full of wasteful spending. When the Senate was voting on the bill in early 2013, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) railed against the unrelated spending, including projects such as Smithsonian repairs, upgrades to National Oceanic and Atmospheric airplanes, and more funding for Head Start.۝ Again, the Smithsonian repairs ۥ representing .004 percent of the money appropriated ۥ were related to Sandy, and the upgrades and repairs to NOAA aircraft were to help with future hurricane forecasting. The money for Head Start, meanwhile, was available only to those facilities damaged by Sandy. On Monday, when Cruz was asked about voting against Sandy aid in 2013 but now openly seeking help for his state, he said there would be time for political sniping۝ later. The problem with that particular bill,۝ Cruz said of the Sandy package on MSNBC, is it became a $50 billion bill that was filled with unrelated pork. Two-thirds of that bill had nothing to do with Sandy, and what I said then and still believe now is that it۪s not right for politicians to exploit a disaster and people hurting to pay for their own political wishlist.۝ Cruz seems to be referring to the fact that only $17 billion of the package was for immediate relief and recovery needs, while other spending was for longer-term projects. Notwithstanding Cruz۪s call for a moratorium on political sniping,۝ s ome New York and New Jersey Republicans couldn۪t help but take a few shots at the Texas delegation on Monday, even as they affirmed that they would support those people in need. Rep. Peter King, whose district encompasses parts of Long Island, tweeted that he wouldn۪t abandon Texas the way Ted Cruz did New York;۝ New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called the Texas lawmakers  hypocrites ; ۝ and Rep. Frank LoBiondo of the Garden State tweeted that d espite the stance of his Texas colleagues on the Sandy relief package, he would support emergency money for their constituents. Overall, 23 of the 24 Texas Republicans then in the House voted against the Sandy package. And joining Cruz in opposing it was the state۪s other senator, John Cornyn (who۪s now that chamber۪s majority whip). HuffPost reached out Monday morning to the offices of the 20 Texas Republicans still in the House, as well as staff members for Cruz and Cornyn, with questions that included whether they thought emergency aid for their state ought to be offset with spending cuts elsewhere and whether they could commit to backing the storm-related funding even if it is not offset and the bill contains some extraneous spending provisions. As of late Monday afternoon, only House Rules Chairman Pete Sessions۪ staff responded and ۥ no shocker here ۥ the lawmaker has no reservations about supporting aid for Texas. With President Donald Trump already touting his administration۪s response to Hurricane Harvey, members of his team also find themselves facing a course reversal from their previous political principles. Vice President Mike Pence, for instance, as a House member from Indiana led the conservative call to offset emergency spending in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina hammered Louisiana and Mississippi. Pence said Monday he expected Congress to make resources available for Texas, with no mention of strings attached. Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney ۥ who as a House member from South Carolina pushed for offsets to the Sandy bill۪s spending and voted against the package ۥ now will be in charge of putting together the administration۪s emergency request for Texas. Hardly anyone expects Mulvaney to insist that those emergency dollars be paid for with cuts elsewhere. It۪s possible that the package just gets attached to an upcoming bill to keep the government operating past Sept. 30. In that case, a number of Republicans ۥ including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who opposed the Sandy bill ۥ could be spared from the political hypocrisy of supporting aid now. After all, they could explain their yes۝ vote by simply focusing on the need to keep the government open. And they۪ll be able to decide if supporting aid for the next natural disaster fits with their political agenda without worry that someone might throw this vote back in their face. CORRECTION : A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that the money to repair roof damage to Smithsonian museums included in the Hurricane Sandy aid bill represented .00004 percent of the legislation۪s total. The correct figure is .004 percent."

The property has a flood insurance policy through the National Flood Insurance Program , a Federal Emergency Management Agency spokesperson told HuffPost. The program provides affordable insurance in flood-prone zones where private insurers have traditionally refused to insure properties because they۪re so vulnerable. The Mar-a-Lago club۪s policy, which is insured to the Trump Organization and Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, is not subsidized and is classified at a full-risk rate for the applicable flood zone, the FEMA spokesperson said. A property covered at the full-risk۝ rate means that its owner is paying a rate that reflects the full risk of flooding up to a certain coverage amount . Older properties can be subsidized,۝ meaning their rates do not necessarily reflect the full risk for those properties. The 1968-era National Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP, offers a mix of rates. The insurance program۪s authorization was set to expire at the end of this month, but Trump signed legislation on Friday that temporarily extends it . NFIP as a whole has been criticized for not charging enough to cover the expected costs of liabilities . It also consistently does not bring in enough money to pay out the properties it insures, and owes around $25 billion to the U.S. Treasury. Based on policies that went into effect on Aug.31, 2016, the program is projected to have a one-year shortfall of $1.4 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report published this month. Some critics say the program benefits affluent people who live on beachfront property , essentially allowing them to live in places that are at a high risk of being damaged. If [NFIP] was a regular insurance company, they would have been in receivership,۝ Burl Daniel, an insurance expert witness from Texas, told HuffPost. But it۪s a political football because of the people who live on the coast.۝ The program was already in trouble۝ before Hurricanes Harvey and Irma began approaching the U.S., said Karen O۪Neill, an associate professor at Rutgers University who studies how policies about land and water affect government power. It became super in trouble after Katrina, and Sandy was another blow,۝ O۪Neill said. Mar-a-Lago, Trump International Golf Club in Palm Beach and Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter are all closed in advance of Irma, a Trump Organization spokesperson said. (She did not respond to the question about insurance.) Irma, one of the largest storms ever recorded , is expected to hit Florida this weekend. Mar-a-Lago has weathered hurricanes before. According to a n Associated Press investigation , Trump claimed that he received a $17 million insurance payout for the estate in 2005 due to damage from a series of storms, but said he pocketed some of the money instead of using it to rebuild. Trump once boasted in a deposition that he had a  very good insurance policy , ۝ apparently in reference to private insurance. ( The FEMA spokesperson declined to comment on whether Mar-a-Lago was also insured by NFIP at the time, as that is not publicly available information.۝) Mar-a-Lago, which Trump bought for $10 million in 1985 , could see its main buildings damaged by an 8-foot storm surge, according to the AP. Thirty years from now, the property could be under at least a foot of water for most of the year, according to a risk analysis prepared for the Guardian . A group of Democratic lawmakers introduced a bill in June that specifically aimed to block Trump properties from receiving any federal subsidy for flood insurance coverage. The name of the bill ۥ the Prohibiting Aid for Recipients Ignoring Science , or Paris, Act ۥ riffs off the Paris climate accord , an agreement from which Trump withdrew that same month. As FEMA noted,the NFIP policy for Mar-a-Lago isn۪t explicitly subsidized. (HuffPost did not ask the agency about policy details for other Trump-owned properties in Florida.) But Democrats say the Paris Act, which is not expected to pass anytime soon, is about the larger principle. It would be outrageous for somebody who is denying the reality of climate, who is undercutting our ability to minimize the effects, to then turn around and be a recipient of federal largess,۝ said Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), who introduced the House bill. We need to stop building in places where nature shows repeatedly that they۪re not wanted,۝ he added. We need to stop making it worse, and we need to put in place programs to try and minimize damage.۝"

Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.) was in a car with Myeshia Johnson, the pregnant widow of Army Sgt. La David Johnson, when Trump called her Tuesday and spoke for about five minutes, according to South Florida۪s NBC affiliate. Wilson said she heard the conversation on speakerphone. Sarcastically he said: But you know he must have known what he signed up for,۪۝ Wilson recounted to NBC6. How could you say that to a grieving widow? I couldn۪t believe... and he said it more than once. I said this man has no feelings for anyone. This is a young woman with child who is grieved to her soul.۝ Wilson, speaking to CNN, said her community was angry about the comments and described Johnson as a local hero. We don۪t have many heroes in our young men in Miami-Dade County, but he was a hero for us,۝the congresswoman told host Don Lemon. When asked what her immediate reaction was, she said: I asked them to give me the phone, because I wanted to speak with him. And I was going to curse him out. That was my reaction... I was livid.۝ The White House declined to comment on the account in statements given to The Washington Post and an ABC affiliate. The president۪s conversations with the families of American heroes who have made the ultimate sacrifice are private,۝ an unnamed official said in the statement. Four Green Berets were killed in an ambush in Niger earlier this month, and two others were wounded. Following a question about why he hadn۪t spoken about their deaths publicly or called troops۪ families, Trump said Monday that he had written personal letters and that he planned to call later. He then used the opportunity to falsely assert that his predecessors  didn۪t make calls ۝ themselves. Former President Barack Obama frequently called the families of soldiers killed in action and visited those wounded during his administration. President George W. Bush visited troops at the Walter Reed medical center 16 times before he left office. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed on Twitter late Tuesday that Trump had called all four families of those killed, saying he offered condolences on behalf of the country.۝ Trump returned to the subject Tuesday, using the death of Chief of Staff John Kelly۪s son in 2010 to illustrate Obama۪s record on calling bereaved families, saying his predecessor did not call in that instance. Obama invited Kelly and his wife, Karen, to a breakfast in 2011 for Gold Star families who have lost children in combat. They were seated at a table with first lady Michelle Obama . Wilson on Tuesday described Trump۪s call as  insensitive ۝ in an interview to a local ABC affiliate. She was with Myeshia Johnson and her two children, ages 2 and 6, as she watched the casket carrying her husband arrive at Miami International Airport. He should have not have said that,۝ Wilson told ABC 10, before repeating, He shouldn۪t have said it.۝"
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/department-of-justice-voter-purge_us_595d22b1e4b0da2c7326c38b","Former Department of Justice officials and voting advocates are seriously alarmed over a DOJ letter sent to states last week that they say could signal a forthcoming effort to kick people off voter rolls. This comes as national attention focuses on several states blocking a request for voter information from President Donald Trump ۪s commission to investigate voting fraud, which does occur, but is not a widespread problem . The DOJ sent the letter to 44 states last Wednesday, the same day the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity sent a letter controversially requesting personal voter information . The DOJ letter requests that election officials respond by detailing their compliance with a section of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA), which covers 44 states and was enacted to help people register to vote, but also specifies when voters may be kicked off the rolls. Several experts said it۪s difficult not to see the DOJ letter in connection with the commission۪s letter as part of a multipronged effort to restrict voting rights. Former Justice Department officials say that while there۪s nothing notable about seeking information about compliance with the NVRA, it is unusual for the department to send out such a broad inquiry to so many states seeking information. Such a wide probe could signal the department is broadly fishing for cases of non-compliance to bring suits aimed at purging the voter rolls. These two letters, sent on the same day, are highly suspect, and seem to confirm that the Trump administration is laying the groundwork to suppress the right to vote,۝ said Vanita Gupta, the CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and former head of DOJ۪s civil rights division under President Barack Obama. It is not normal for the Department of Justice to ask for voting data from all states covered by the National Voter Registration Act. It۪s likely that this is instead the beginning of an effort to force unwarranted voter purges.۝ If this went to any individual states, I don۪t think anybody would۪ve blinked twice,۝ said Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School who served as deputy assistant attorney general in the civil rights division in the Obama administration. The letter asked for public information that was uncontroversial, he added, but what made the letter really weird۝ was that it was sent out to so many states. The Department of Justice does investigations all the time, but those are usually based on individualized predicates to believe that there۪s a problem in a given area, in a given jurisdiction. And I۪m not aware of a similar letter being sent to blanket jurisdictions across the country,۝ he said. The NVRA requires states to conduct a general program that makes a reasonable effort to remove the names of ineligible voters from the official lists.۝ If a state wants to act to remove a voter from its rolls, it must first send a broad, nondiscriminatory solicitation seeking a confirmation of address to those registered. If a person fails to respond, they can only be removed from the rolls if they don۪t vote in the next two consecutive federal elections. In the past, voting rights groups have used the legislation as a powerful tool to try to prevent states from kicking eligible voters off their rolls. The Supreme Court will consider a case next term dealing with whether a voter removal process used in Ohio is violating the NVRA. The DOJ letter asks the states covered by the NVRA to provide information on the processes they use to remove people from the voting lists and the people authorized to implement them. It also asks for data from recent years on the number of voters removed from the voting rolls and the reasons they were removed. When you see DOJ send a bunch of letters like this requesting information about compliance with the law, that۪s usually a sign that they۪re kicking an enforcement campaign into gear,۝ Sam Bagenstos, who served as the principal deputy assistant attorney general for civil rights from 2009 until 2011. It looks like what they۪re doing is they۪re laying the groundwork to file lawsuits against states that, in their view, aren۪t kicking enough people off of the rolls.۝ Devin O۪Malley, a Justice Department spokesman, said the department۪s review of list maintenance procedures hadn۪t been done in many years. The Department of Justice is committed to free and fair elections for all Americans. Congress enacted the NVRA۪s list-maintenance provisions specifically to advance that goal. The Department had not conducted a review of state and local list-maintenance activities under the NVRA for many years,۝ he said in a statement. The Department looks forward to working with state and local election officials to facilitate appropriate list-maintenance activities toward our common goal of free and fair elections for all voters.۝ A DOJ official also said the department had not coordinated with the separate election integrity commission. But Bagenstos said he was skeptical the two efforts weren۪t related and were part of a multifaceted approach by the Trump administration to make voting more difficult. What an amazing coincidence that these letters went out on the same day. This administration is, without even knowing it, doing parallel efforts to try to trim the voting roll. I don۪t buy it,۝ he said. He added that the voter fraud commission led by Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach was trying to create a nationwide database of voter registration that would paint a picture of potential voter fraud that could then be used to justify more restrictive voting laws. David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and a former DOJ lawyer, agrees. In the quarter-century since passage of the NVRA, of which I spent seven years as a DOJ lawyer enforcing the NVRA, among other laws, I do not know of the DOJ conducting any other broad-based fishing expedition into list maintenance compliance, whether during Democratic or Republican administrations,۝ he wrote in a Thursday op-ed . Becker also noted it was strange the DOJ letter only focused on voter list maintenance procedures and did not want to examine compliance with parts of the law aimed at making it easier to vote. Allegra Chapman, director of voting and elections at nonprofit group Common Cause, said she found it striking the DOJ was uninterested in the aspect of the law that provided voter registration opportunities at public assistance agencies. To me, that indicates this agency just has zero interest in ensuring the rights of poor Americans too and ensuring that, you know, people across the income divide are equally being given the registration services that they۪re entitled to under federal law,۝ she said in an interview. While Bagenstos said he was alarmed by both the Kobach and DOJ requests, he believed the department could be a much more potent tool in curbing access to the ballot box. On Kris Kobach۪s work on this commission, they۪re going to get a lot of pushback, they۪ve already gotten some pushback from states. It۪s all been sort of ham-handed,۝ he said. They don۪t really have staff, so that۪s all really amateurish and it might not go anywhere. But the folks at DOJ know what they۪re doing and I really worry that at the end of the day there۪s gonna be a lot of noise about this Kobach-Pence commission and people will miss the enforcement efforts of DOJ.۝ DOJ, at the end of the day, is more likely to be successful as a tool in this process than is this commission, so that۪s why I worry more about them,۝ he said.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mueller-probe-outgrows-its-witch-hunt-phase_us_5a4402a2e4b06d1621b6b4d9","Steve Bannon۪s eyes lit up. Several months before he left his job as a senior White House adviser last August, Bannon was talking to President Trump about the brewing political storm over the Justice Department investigation into his campaign۪s alleged ties to the Kremlin. Suddenly, Trump had an inspiration.He looked straight at Bannon,jabbed at him with his finger and uttered the phrase that would become the slogan of the White House pushback against the Russia probe: Witch hunt!۝ Brilliant,thought Bannon, as he later related the exchange to colleagues. Ever since, it is a phrase Trump has returned to time and again  and repackaged with typical Trumpian hyperbole. This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!۝ Trump tweeted last May after ex-FBI director Robert Mueller was appointed as Justice Department special counsel to oversee the probe. But now, as Trump prepares to end his first year in office, the witch hunt narrative may have outlived its usefulness. Mueller۪s investigation has expanded and gained serious traction: The president۪s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and Manafort۪s chief deputy, Rick Gates, have been indicted. His former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, has pleaded guilty and is now a cooperating witness. So too is a former foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, who has admitted lying to the FBI about repeated contacts with alleged Russian cutouts who had offered the Trump campaign dirt۝ on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails.۝ As described by sources familiar with various aspects of the investigation, the Mueller probe is fast approaching a critical crossroads.The president۪s lawyers, Ty Cobb and John Dowd, are pressing Mueller to wind down the investigation and exonerate their client, which they have assured the president will happen by early next year. But the sources familiar with the probe say that such a rapid conclusion is  as one put it  fanciful.۝ Mueller and his team, they say, are pursuing new leads, interrogating new witnesses and collecting a mountain of new evidence, including subpoenaed bank records and thousands of emails from the campaign and the Trump transition. In just the last few weeks, his prosecutors have begun questioning Republican National Committee staffers about the party digital operation that worked with the Trump campaign to target voters in key swing states. They are seeking to determine if the joint effort was related to the activities of Russian trolls and bots aimed at influencing the American electorate, according to two of the sources. In what is potentially another ominous sign for the White House, the lawyer for Jared Kushner, the president۪s son in law and senior adviser who was in charge of the campaign۪s digital operation, recently began searching for a crisis public relations firm to handle press inquiries  a step frequently taken by people who believe they may be facing criminal charges.(Kushner has denied all wrongdoing, and his lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has said he is cooperating with the Mueller investigation.) Even if the new lines of inquiry don۪t result in additional indictments  something unknowable at this point  the new material all but guarantees the Mueller investigation will stretch on for months, if not years, likely provoking Trump to revisit his decision not to fire the special counsel. And if the president does take that step, many lawmakers and legal veterans say, it will cause a political explosion unlike any the capital has seen in decades. It will be cataclysmic,۝ said Richard Ben-Veniste, a former Watergate prosecutor who lived through the so-called Saturday night massacre when President Richard Nixon fired special prosecutor Archibald Cox. It will create a constitutional crisis.۝ In the meantime, the president۪s allies are mounting a ferocious attack on Mueller۪s team  pointing to tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions to Hillary Clinton and other Democrats by the special counsel۪s prosecutors, and to text messages disparaging Trump by FBI agent Peter Strzok, whom Mueller has since moved off the investigation.They are also gunning for top FBI officials,especially deputy director Andrew McCabe, who they believe began a counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign۪s links to the Russians last year based in part on the controversial dossier prepared by a former British spy and funded as opposition research۝ by the Clinton campaign. Everything points to the fact that there was an orchestrated plan to try to prevent Donald Trump from being the next president of the United States,۝ said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a member of the House Judiciary Committee,in a recent television interview in which he vowed to subpoena senior FBI agents about the origins of the probe.  But for Democrats, the attacks on Mueller and the FBI are a distraction tactic meant to obscure how much has already been uncovered about the Trump team۪s contacts with the Russians. Back in January, when the issue first starting getting political traction, the president and his top aides denied that he and his campaign had any connections to Moscow. I have nothing to do with Russia,۝ Trump tweeted at the time. Since then, Mueller۪s team and congressional investigators have detailed numerous contacts, meetings and email exchanges between Trump۪s campaign and Russian-connected operatives and officials that were unknown to the public when voters went to the polls in November 2016. Jeff Sessions, the Trump campaign۪s chief national security adviser, met with the Russian ambassador at a hotel reception and later in his Senate office. Papadopoulos met with a Russia-connected professor and a woman introduced as Putin۪s niece۝ in an effort to set up a summit between Trump and the Russian president. And most famously, Donald Trump Jr., Kushner and Manafort all met in Trump Tower with a delegation of Russians who they believed had derogatory information on Hillary Clinton  including official documents۝  that came straight from the highest levels of the Kremlin. Just from what۪s been made public, it۪s pretty clear the Trump campaign and family were willing and eager to work with the Russians,۝ said Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., a member of the House Intelligence Committee. They showed almost no restraint in engaging with the Russians to see what they had to offer on their opponent. It was a whatever it takes۪ mentality.۝ Whether all this adds up to collusion۝  the sensational charge of active collaboration between the Trump campaign and Moscow that was first laid out in the controversial dossier commissioned by the Clinton campaign  is far from clear. But for Swalwell and quite a few others, it is already clear that the Russian probe has been far more than a witch hunt.

John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Friday that he doesn۪t support the latest Obamacare repeal bill, all but ensuring Republicans۪ last-ditch effort to gut the Affordable Care Act is dead in the water. I cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal,۝ McCain said in a statement. I believe we could do better working together, Republicans and Democrats, and have not yet really tried,۝ he said. Nor could I support it without knowing how much it will cost, how it will affect insurance premiums, and how many people will be helped or hurt by it. Without a full [Congressional Budget Office] score, which won۪t be available by the end of the month, we won۪t have reliable answers to any of those questions.۝ Since the entire Democratic caucus opposes the bill, dubbed Cassidy-Graham, Republican leaders can afford to lose only two GOP senators on it. McCain۪s decision means the bill doesn۪t appear to have the votes to pass.Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has said he۪s opposed to it , and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) has said she۪s leaning against۝ it . Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who voted against the last repeal bill, has also raised concerns with this one. In a lengthy statement, McCain underscored that the process has been terrible and suggested he won۪t support any repeal bill that wasn۪t vetted through the usual rigorous, bipartisan debate. Republican leaders have been rushing to try to pass the billʉۥ any repeal bill, really ۥ because their ability to pass something with 51 votes (including Vice President Mike Pence۪s tiebreaker) instead of 60 expires at the end of the month. I would consider supporting legislation similar to that offered by my friends Senators Graham and Cassidy were it the product of extensive hearings, debate and amendment. But that has not been the case,۝ he said. Instead, the specter of September 30 th budget reconciliation deadline has hung over this entire process.۝ He also nudged leadership to let the senators working on a bipartisan solution to health care continue their work.Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) have been holding hearings and trying to come up with a health care bill both parties can get behind, but GOP leaders effectively shut down their work to clear the path for the Cassidy-Graham bill. Senators Alexander and Murray have been negotiating in good faith to fix some of the problems with Obamacare,۝ said McCain. But I fear that the prospect of one last attempt at a strictly Republican bill has left the impression that their efforts cannot succeed. I hope they will resume their work should this last attempt at a partisan solution fail.۝ Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.)hailed McCain۪s decision to move on from his party۪s months-long repeal effort. John McCain shows the same courage in Congress that he showed when he was a naval aviator,۝ Schumer said in a statement. I have assured Senator McCain that as soon as repeal is off the table, we Democrats are intent on resuming the bipartisan process.۝ The Arizona senator۪s announcement isn۪t a total surprise. He helped bring down the GOP۪s last repeal bill in a dramatic, late-night vote. But this time, his close friend Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) is leading the charge on the legislation, and it was unclear if McCain was prepared to vote against his pal. McCain acknowledged that made his decision more difficult. I take no pleasure in announcing my opposition. Far from it,۝ he said. The bill۪s authors are my dear friends, and I think the world of them. I know they are acting consistently with their beliefs and sense of what is best for the country. So am I.۝ Graham tweeted later that there۪s no hard feelings. One of the first people to praise McCain for his decision was late-night show host Jimmy Kimmel. He۪s been tearing into the bill۪s other author, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), all week for going back on his word about advocating a repeal bill that ensures pre-existing condition protections and lower costs. The Cassidy-Graham bill does neither. Thank you, @SenJohnMcCain for being a hero again and again and now AGAIN,۝ tweeted Kimmel. CORRECTION: Republican leaders can afford to lose the votes of only two GOP senators, not three, on the current Obamacare repeal bill."

The president۪s son used the platform to criticize supporters of net neutrality after the Federal Communications Commission repealed the Title II protections that kept the internet a public utility. Unfortunately, Trump Jr. doesn۪t seem to have all the facts in order. I would pay good money to see all those people complaining about Obama۪s FCC chairman voting to repeal #NetNeutality actually explain it in detail,۝ Trump Jr. wrote. I۪d also bet most hadn۪t heard of it before this week. #outrage.۝ In fact,President Donald Trump designated Ajit Pai the FCC chairman in January. Former President Barack Obama appointed Pai to a five-year term on the commission in 2012, but Democrats fought against his term۪s renewal last year. The commission voted to repeal the net neutrality protections in a 3-2 vote, with Pai voting in the majority. Net neutrality rules were initially put in place to ensure that internet service providers, ISPs, treated all information and content across the web equally. Repealing the Title II protections would allow internet service providers, such as Verizon or Comcast, to decide what content would be blocked or offered at slower speeds in favor of the company۪s own content. Critics of Pai۪s repeal effort fear that ISPs will discriminate against internet traffic and charge companies such as Netflix or Amazon exorbitant fees to give consumers efficient access to those services. (HuffPost۪s parent company, Oath, is owned by Verizon. HuffPost is also represented by the Writers Guild of America, East, which supports net neutrality and opposed its repeal). Millions of Americans had protested Pai۪s plan to repeal net neutrality regulations. Citizens have protested to keep the rules in place , in addition to calling offices of public officials to protect the internet.Congress could nullify the FCC decision with a Congressional Review Act resolution,and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said Thursday that he would introduced one, but it۪s considered a long shot. More than 20 U.S. senators attempted to delay Thursday۪s vote after suspecting that the FCC was flooded with fraudulent comments , especially those in favor of the repeal. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman opened an investigation, which showed that up to 2 million comments were submitted under false names. Schneiderman announced that he would sue to prevent the rollbacks on Thursday. In a YouTube video , Schneiderman criticized the FCC۪s lack of assistance in his office۪s investigation and called the vote a travesty. Today۪s vote also follows a public comment process that was deeply corrupted, including 2 million comments that stole the identities of real people,۝ Schneiderman said in his video. This is a crime under New York law ۥ and the FCC۪s decision to go ahead with the vote makes a mockery of government integrity and rewards the very perpetrators who scammed the system to advance their own agenda.۝ Language in this story and its headline has been amended to clarify that while former President Barack Obama appointed Ajit Pai to the FCC, it was President Donald Trump who designated Pai the agency chairman."

Twice Nehlen dodged the question. The third time he didn۪t respond. The Wisconsin Republican is running to replace House Speaker Paul Ryan, who might not be seeking re-election. Nehlen campaigned in Alabama recently for Roy Moore, the Senate nominee accused of sexual misconduct, who suffered a historic defeat Tuesday. Nehlen claims to have raised six figures۝ for the Moore campaign. Nehlen was a speaker Monday at Moore۪s campaign rally in Midland City, Alabama. He took the stage wearing the red Make America great again۝ cap and warned the crowd that we۪re engaged in a spiritual battle.۝ Moore was the only one, he said, who could drain that swamp۝ up in D.C. Only two days earlier, on Dec. 9, Nehlen was a guest on an anti-Semitic white power podcast called Fash the Nation,۝ talking to hosts  Jazzhands McFeels۝ and Marcus Halberstram۝ for about an hour. (Fash۝ is shorthand among the so-called alt-right, a loose association of white nationalists, for fascist.۝) It was Nehlen۪s second appearance on the show, and his fluency with white nationalist jargon was evident as he made thinly veiled anti-Semitic remarks and proudly recounted having told a Jewish magazine editor to eat a bullet.۝ On Dec. 8, Nehlen used Gab, a micro-blogging platform used primarily by white nationalists, to repost a drawing another user had made for him. The drawing showed a puny Ryan, seen as the anti-Trump, next to a buff Chad۝ Nehlen. (Chad is an alt-right term for a fit alpha-male womanizer.) In the accompanying text, Nehlen is described as having redpilled on globalism, RR and JQ.۝ Redpilled,۝ a reference to the Matrix movie trilogy, is used to describe an awakening to white supremacist teachings. RR۝ stands for race realism,۝ and JQ۝ stands for the  Jewish question ,۝ the anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that Jews have undue influence over the media, banking and politics that must somehow be addressed. Earlier this month, Nehlen tweeted It۪s okay to be white,۝ a meme that originated on the message board 4chan, a haven for neo-Nazi trolls, and was spread enthusiastically by white nationalists. In fact it۪s pretty awesome,۝ he added in a follow-up tweet. On at least two occasions this month, Nehlen has retweeted racist memes shared by Mark Collett, a British Nazi sympathizer. On the night of Aug. 11, when neo-Nazis and other assorted racists marched with tiki torches through Charlottesville, Virginia, Nehlen retweeted an image of the march posted by white nationalist Jason Kessler: Incredible moment for white people who۪ve had it up to here & aren۪t going to take it anymore. Tomorrow we #UnitetheRight #Charlottesville.۝ After Moore۪s defeat in Alabama, Nehlen shared another piece of fan art Wednesday that was created for him on Gab. It showed Roman centurions with Pepe the Frog۝ heads. (Pepe the Frog is the mascot of the white nationalists.) I call on all ready and able #GabFam to run for #House and #Senate and to vote for fellow #GabFam like @pnehlen in 2018,۝ read the text. HuffPost emailed Nehlen on Wednesday detailing some of these  and other  flirtations he۪s made with being an avowed white nationalist.Asked if he considers himself either a white nationalist or a member of the alt-right, Nehlen largely dodged the question, sending the following statement: I۪m a successful businessman and have had something like 20,000 employees around the globe of every color, race, and creed; not to mention patented inventions so attempts to paint me as anything but a successful businessman reflect on the media۪s identity politics not my Christian faith. Besides ۥ it۪s true that it۪s okay to be white ۥ it۪s pretty awesome in fact. Asked in a follow-up email to clarify whether or not he۪s a white nationalist with a simple yes or no, Nehlen responded: Given that the media is still determined to libel all conservatives as bigots, it seems some clarity on the definition of American Nationalism ۥ the idea that the United States should put the economic and security interests of American citizens ahead of the economic and security interests of illegal aliens and non-citizens ۥis in order. In a third email Thursday, HuffPost noted that this was a definition of nationalism, but that it didn۪t answer the question as to whether Nehlen considers himself a white nationalist or a member of the alt-right. He didn۪t respond. Nehlen۪s association with the Moore campaign, which received funding from the Republican National Committee and was endorsed by President Donald Trump , shows that a faction of the GOP appears to be at ease with white nationalists in its ranks. At the Moore campaign rally Monday he attended,Moore۪s wife defended her husband from accusations of anti-Semitism by saying that one of his attorneys is a Jew. (An investigation by The Forward failed to find this Jewish lawyer.) It also shows that Steve Bannon۪s effort to publicly distance himself from the alt-right is a ruse.Bannon, the Breitbart News executive chairman and a former White House chief strategist, had championed Moore and is backing Nehlen. Nehlen told HuffPost that Bannon is a friend.۝ On the Fash the Nation۝ podcast, Nehlen said Bannon considers him a kamikaze۝ against the GOP establishment. Bannon did not respond to a request for comment on Nehlen۪s white nationalist sentiments.Neither did the Moore campaign.Nor did the National Republican Congressional Committee. Nehlen has been comfortable expressing bigoted comments in public for a while now, as documented by the Angry White Men blog run by Twitter user @EyesOnTheRight. Earlier this month, during a Twitter spat with Richard Lawler, an editor at tech news site Engadget who is black, Nehlen tweeted, Run along Tyrone.۝ As @EyesOnTheRight wrote, There are two ways to interpret that comment, both of which suggest Nehlen was making a racist remark. On the one hand, Nehlen used a stereotypically black name to refer to an African-American man whose name he clearly knew. On the other, Tyrone۪ is a reference to a racist joke popular on the alt-right.۝ That joke۝ features a deeply racist cartoon rendering of a black man, which we won۪t republish here. On the Fash the Nation۝ podcast last weekend,Nehlen recounted another Twitter spat he۪d had, this one with John Podhoretz, the conservative editor of Commentary magazine. After an argument over gun control, Nehlen had tweeted to Podhoretz, who is Jewish,that he should self-deport۝ and eat a bullet.۝ So Bannon۪s catamite @pnehlen has, in the past 12 hours, suggested I commit suicide and called on me, born and raised in the U.S. but Jewish, to self-deport,۪۝ Podhoretz tweeted. Catamite۝ is an obscure word referring to a young boy kept by a pederast. What race even has that word? ۝ Nehlen asked on Fash the Nation.۝ Well, there۪s one .۝ The hosts laughed. McFeels called it a very biblical term,۝ emphasizing again Podheretz۪s religious heritage. If people watch you stand in the face of the people like [the] John Podhoretzes of the world, the people who want to throw their parentheses at you  I have no time for that,۝ Nehlen said. I۪m not afraid of those guys.۝ Parentheses۝ is a reference to the anti-Semitic  echo ۝ gimmick, in which the names of Jews or Jewish institutions are placed in triple parentheses. Nehlen was suspended from Twitter for 12 hours for telling Podhoretz to eat a bullet.۝ He told the Fash the Nation۝ hosts that he got shoah۪d for 12 hours.۝ Shoah۝ is a Hebrew word for calamity,۝used most commonly to refer to the Holocaust. For white nationalists, though, it۪s used as a slur, reserved for small inconveniences  like getting suspended by Twitter  as a way of diminishing the horror of the Holocaust. Nehlen also bragged that his fans had listened to his first appearance on Fash the Nation۝ and that theʉthe redpills are being shot at people like with bump fire stocks.۝ (Translation: He۪s converting a lot of his supporters into white nationalists.) At another point,Nehlen and the hosts talked gushingly about a recent stunt by the white nationalist group Identity Evropa , whose members joined the violent Unite the Right۝ rally in Charlottesville this summer. In March, Identity Evropa hung a giant banner from a highway overpass in Georgia that read America first. End immigration now.۝ The group tweeted out a photo, which Nehlen retweeted. The Fash the Nation۝ hosts were deeply flattered that Nehlen was a guest on their show. McFeels  who, it should be noted, has appeared on the radio show of David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard, and has called for the creation of a white ethno-state۝  lashed out at Paul Ryan for taking money from Jewish paymasters۝ and promised to make sure۝ Nehlen wins his congressional race in Wisconsin. Nehlen replied that he was honored۝ to be on the show. You guys do great, great work,۝ he said."

Chuck Grassley implied that people not currently affected by that tax are spending every darn penny ... on booze or women.۝ I think not having the estate tax recognizes the people that are investing  as opposed to those that are just spending every darn penny they have, whether it۪s on booze or women or movies,۝ Grassley told the Des Moines Register in an interview published Saturday. Grassley, who serves on the Finance Committee, made the remark when asked about the Senate tax reform measure which would double the exemption for estates to $11 million for an individual and $22 million for a couple. Heirs would inherit the estates tax-free. Grassley۪s comment triggered a wave of criticism on social media.Many complained that the working class is, in fact, spending every darn penny۝ on raising their kids, caring for elderly parents, health care and putting food on the table. One Twitter user complained that the GOP was turning America into a version of The Hunger Games.۝ The Grassley interview was part of the Des Moines Register۪s examination of how the tax reform measure radically reducing estate taxes will affect Iowans. Grassley has long argued that estate taxes, which currently must be paid on individual estates worth more than $5.5 million ($11 million for a married couple), hurt farms and small businesses in the state. Now, the Iowa senator apparently sees the tax change as a way to reward those who have accumulated millions of dollars by investing.۝ The newspaper found that the estate tax break will affect only dozens۝among 1.4 million Iowa taxpayers, according to IRS data ,because almost all estates fall under the current exemption cap. The newspaper noted that the number of Iowans owing estate taxes was just 32 of 1.4 million taxpayers in 2012  or .002 percent of the total. Sixty-one people  .004 percent of all Iowa taxpayersʉ filed estate taxes in 2015. Only a fraction of those were farmers or small business owners,the newspaper reported. Currently, only .2 percent of Americans pay estate tax and will benefit from the changes.The House measure would eliminate the tax on all estates of any size by 2024. The Senate and House measures will have to be reconciled. Rep. David Young (R-Iowa) and Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) both applauded the changes in the estate tax and emphasized how the changes would help farms and small businesses.

Michael Corcoran, a reporter for the now-defunct Maximum Golf magazine, said he heard the remark while he shadowed Trump in 2000 for a feature story.

Among them, Jill Harth said Trump sexually assaulted her in his daughter Ivanka۪s bedroom in 1993; Jessica Leeds said Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt۝ on an airplane in the 1970s; and Rachel Crooks, then a 22-year-old receptionist in Trump Tower, said Trump kissed her directly on the mouth۝ at their first meeting in 2005.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-impeachment-donald-trump_us_5a28616be4b03ece02ffedd1","WASHINGTON ۥ Fifty-eight House Democrats voted to advance the impeachment of President Donald Trump on Wednesday, in direct defiance of the pleas of House Democratic leaders earlier in the day. A vote to table the impeachment resolution was agreed to 368-58, with four Democrats voting just present۝ and 126 other Democrats voting with Republicans to kill the resolution. It may seem like this was an overwhelming confirmation of Trump ۥ and it was, in the sense that no Republican voted to advance impeachment and more than two-thirds of Democrats joined their GOP colleagues ۥ but 58 Democratic votes is still a significant statement on impeachment.  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) issued a joint statement just before the vote urging their Democratic colleagues to reject the impeachment resolution. They presented the vote as a distraction from efforts to kill the Republican tax bill, which is swiftly making its way through Congress, and they cited the special counsel۪s investigation of Trump, as well as inquiries from congressional committees, to plead with Democrats to hold off. Now is not the time,۝ Pelosi and Hoyer wrote. But the most progressive wing of the Democratic caucus, bolstered by a large number of Congressional Black Caucus members ۥ including the No. 3 Democrat, Assistant Democratic Leader Jim Clyburn (S.C.) ۥ ignored Pelosi and Hoyer and voted for impeachment. The resolution was introduced by CBC member Al Green (D-Texas), who was talked out of forcing an impeachment vote earlier in the year. Green, wearing an American flag tie, said his resolution wasn۪t about Democrats or Republicans; it was about democracy, about the fate of our republic.۝ May everyone vote their conscience knowing that history will judge us all,۝ Green said. Rather than attacking Trump over issues like Russia, Green۪s impeachment resolution hits Trump for race-baiting, bigotry, anti-Semitism, and a number of Trump۪s comments, including his statements after the protests in Charlottesville, Virginia; comments against the governor of Puerto Rico; and even Trump۪s crusade against NFL protests. By not bringing Russia into the matter, the resolution may just be a proxy for the general anger toward Trump in the Democratic base, and Green may have had an easier time arguing to his colleagues that his resolution should proceed. Despite Pelosi and Hoyer۪s concerns that the impeachment resolution would simply become a cudgel to divide Democrats, the vote will likely help some Democratic members, particularly those in far-left districts. But the vote might not be without consequences. Unabashed liberal Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colo.) and more moderate Rep. Tim Walz (D-Minn.),who are both running for governor of their respective states, also voted to advance the impeachment process. Still, Green argued that civility from Democrats had prevented them from confronting Trump for too long.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/leandra-english-gop-boogeyman_us_5a2724dfe4b0c2117626a246","Over the past two weeks, conservative media has been warning of a new menace loose in the corridors of Washington, a  rogue ۝ agent  burrowing ۝ into the federal bureaucracy to mount a  coup ۝ that could shatter the rule of law and shred the Constitution in a deranged bid for unaccountable power. It۪s the type of conspiracy theory popular in Facebook groups and Reddit forums that cater to fringe paranoia. But in this case, these ominous concerns are coming from Republican senators. They۪re the latest salvo in a quixotic, yearslong battle the GOP has waged against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an agency Congress created in 2010 to streamline federal oversight of abusive banking practices. And the main target of this impassioned vitriol is a 34-year-old bureaucrat named Leandra English. English, according to interviews with several former colleagues, is, well ۥ she۪s boring. Not dull. Plenty of people commended her energy and intellect. But someone who specializes in work that doesn۪t demand a spotlight.After earning a master۪s degree from the London School of Economics, she۪s built a career as a Washington functionary, changing federal agencies every few years as new opportunities arose, distinguishing herself by working long hours and, as multiple people said, keeping the trains running on time.۝ At the bureau, she was known as somebody with no ego,۝ notes Patricia McCoy, former CFPB assistant director for mortgage markets. Her talent in cutting through red tape was widely recognized.۝ She worked later than probably anybody I know,۝ says Chris Vaeth, who spent five years at the CFPB, ultimately leading its Office of Community Affairs. English declined to comment for this story. The bulk of that work took place at the CFPB, where English started in 2010 and returned after separate stints at the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management. She worked on the transition team that put the nascent agency on its feet. As deputy director for external affairs, she was charged with such radical activities as outreach to community banks and the establishment of a consumer complaint system. She۪s been deputy chief operations officer and deputy chief of staff. Prior to the election last year, she applied for a job as the bureau۪s chief of staff, which she started in January. And she۪s effective. The consumer complaint system works. Even bank lobbyists pressing for lighter regulation acknowledge some grudging admiration. I like Leandra,۝ Consumer Bankers Association CEO Richard Hunt told American Banker. I think she was a terrific chief of staff.۝ Then, on Nov. 24, English took a career risk that landed her name in the papers. When CFPB Director Richard Cordray resigned to run for office in Ohio, he named English deputy director.English accepted the nod, knowing it was a politically controversial appointment ۥ a deliberate attempt to prevent President Donald Trump from installing a loyalist hostile to the agency۪s mission without at least going through the Senate confirmation process. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the 2010 law that established the agency, the deputy director becomes acting director whenever the director himself is absent or unavailable.۝ English was, she believed, now in charge of the agency she had helped found. But the president was apparently unhappy with this reasoning. Over Thanksgiving weekend, he named his budget director, Mick Mulvaney , acting head of the CFPB. English sued , and the question of who is actually running the agency is now making its way through federal court. Mulvaney is ideologically hostile to the bureau. He once called it a sick, sad۝ joke . At a news conference last Monday, he declared that it had been trampling on capitalism.۝ This is rather feverish rhetoric to describe an agency that essentially guards against petty theft. Over the past six years, the CFPB has returned roughly $12 billion in ill-gotten gains from financial institutions to over 29 million consumers. For individual families, that can mean substantive relief ۥ hundreds, and in some cases, thousands of dollars over bogus charges or deceptive contracts. But it۪s hardly a threat to American capitalism, which has grown from a $16 trillion annual enterprise the day the CFPB opened its doors to an over $17 trillion operation today. The agency۪s most recent major enforcement action was a $100 million fine imposed against Wells Fargo for secretly creating millions of bank accounts for customers who had never asked for them. In Mulvaney۪s installation, CFPB۪s leadership saw an effort from the Trump administration to dismantle an organization they had constructed from scratch. English and her supporters are perfectly aware they may well lose their case. An early court ruling has already come down in Trump۪s favor, and the CFPB۪s own general counsel has issued a memo siding with Mulvaney, who says he would keep English as deputy director if he ultimately prevails . If Trump were simply better organized, he could sidestep the entire affair by just naming a full-time director and getting him or her confirmed by the Senate. But it۪s hard to build things in Washington that genuinely work, and very easy to destroy them. To English and her allies, even a long-shot bid to postpone or mitigate the damage is better than a full surrender. That۪s the not-so-secret reason Republicans expend so much venom on the CFPB. Though plenty of the CFPB۪s enemies in the GOP have accepted robust campaign contributions from the financial sector, the agency poses a much more serious threat to conservative ideology than it does to any donor۪s bottom line. The financial industry has been booking handsome profits throughout the CFPB۪s existence ۥ the $12 billion it has had to give back didn۪t put an end to big bonuses, or force any legitimate businesses to close up shop. The CFPB instead serves as a constant institutional reminder that government can ۥ if it relies on the right people ۥ actually get things done. And so the Republican attacks on English don۪t accuse her of waste or incompetence or any of the other stock conservative objections to bureaucracy. They have instead portrayed her as a dangerous mastermind. This rogue employee is trying to ... run the agency as an unaccountable fourth branch of government,۝ wrote nine GOP senators, including Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in a letter to Mulvaney. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), meanwhile, penned a lengthy conspiratorial inquiry to Kathleen McGettigan, acting director of the Office of Personnel Management, accusing English of burrowing۝ into the CFPB for political purposes. Johnson wanted to know whether English had abused۝ the hiring process by securing the chief of staff job in January. The criticism has outraged English۪s former colleagues. As somebody who saw her work and values her highly, I۪m just really offended at the attempt to portray her as some kind of venal, spotlight-grabbing carpetbagger,۝ says Holly Petraeus, a former assistant director at the CFPB who retired this year. She۪s not that at all.۝ The things they۪re saying are so ridiculous. They just say the absolute opposite of what is true,۝ says Elizabeth Vale, who served as director of external affairs for the CFPB. She could have gone and made a lot of money somewhere. She is a true, dedicated public servant who wants to make a real difference in this world ... if you asked me to put the people I admire most as public servants on that list, she would be in the top five.۝ Vale, who also worked with former senior adviser Valerie Jarrett in the Obama White House, now teaches at the University of Pennsylvania. That is the ultimate tragedy of the CFPB. Eventually, English will lose, one way or another. Trump or Vice President Mike Pence or someone else will get around to naming a full-time director and for a few months or maybe even a couple of years, devoted public servants will try to hang on. But capable people like English will only stick around for so long in a place where the top brass is determined to prevent them from actually accomplishing anything. They۪ll accept other job offers, finding a different quiet,thankless way to contribute to society. The CFPB will decay into just another dysfunctional Washington paper-mill and banks will become steadily more shameless in their reliance on predatory practices. Not because it is inevitable, but because a handful of people in power will decide it should be so."

Now,eight years later, to celebrate the anniversary of their blessed union, it appears that our country۪s foremost power couple will enjoy a tight 21 minutes of sweet, presumably missionary-style love-making with 2004 pop sensation James Blunt crooning in their ear.We can surmise this thanks to Spotify. Because, reader, on Sunday,Oct. 15, Ivanka Trump made this playlist : The 21-minute-long collection of songs is as horny as it is depressing.The playlist evokes motionless, antiseptic coitus.It evokes two Tide pens in a plastic sale tub. It evokes Lysol wipes. It evokes the smooth, genderless slopes of a couple of undressed dolls. This is sex music only in the sense that two pages pressed together in a new Williams Sonoma catalog is sex. How can we be so sure this is about sex, you wonder? For starters, consider that this is the first public playlist Ivanka has made since her 2015 banger,  Holiday Party ,۝and that it is also the only one she has ever made with such a cryptic title. (The rest bear names likeʉWalk to Work۝ and Weekend Morning.۝) Should you google the playlist۪s title, 991122,۝ the vast majority of your results would relate to the corresponding HTML color code, a deep red, which prompts the images you see below: Pair all this with the knowledge that the list was made just 10 days before the couple۪s anniversary, and it۪s hard to see this as anything but their 21-minute sex playlist. Still, admittedly, it is not definitive proof. There are, however, some things we can know for certain. The Spotify account, for instance,definitely belongs to Ivanka.Back in 2014,Ivanka Trump shared her Weekend Morning۝ playlist on her website, IvankaTrump.com . The embedded list  which contains such aggressively uninteresting hits as Send Me On My Way۝ by Rusted Root and Uptown Funk۝ by Mark Ronson  was created by the same Ivanka Trump who created the apparent 21-minute sex playlist in question. We also know that the couple (or at least the Ivanka half of it) has a history of getting sentimental over songsespecially those that hold some sort of significance to their relationship. In 2013, while talking about giving birth to her first child, Arabella, Ivanka told Fit Pregnancy magazine that she and Jared made a playlist for the delivery of all the songs from our relationship. Arabella was actually born while my wedding song, This Year۪s Love۪ by David Gray, was playing. It was a coincidence, but it was cool!۝ Though we can۪t know for sure how these specific songs might be important to Jared and Ivanka۪s pure,carefully scheduled love, we can take some educated guesses.In John Legend۪s All of Me,۝ for instance, Legend sings, Even when I lose I۪m winning.۝ Jared and Ivanka are both notorious workaholics, with Ivanka even telling New York in 2009, Jared and I are very similar in that we۪re very ambitious.۝In the song Ordinary People,۝ the line I know I misbehaved and you made your mistakes۝might be an allusion to Ivanka۪s initial hesitancy in converting to Judaism. A true shonda. Then, in Bruno Mars۪ When I Was Your Man,۝ we hear Oh, I know I۪m probably much too late/To try and apologize for my mistakes,۝ a clear reference to Jared۪s failure in brokering Middle East peace. You۪re Beautiful۝ is of course a reference to the fact that they are sexually attracted to one another, while When We Were Young۝ alludes to the fact that they are both, in fact, young.۝ So, is this Ivanka and Jared۪s 21-minute sex playlist?The verdict here is a lusty yes.And if you, too, want to make love for 21 minutes like Jared and Ivanka, just grab a partner, put on this playlist, and be born to millionaire parents who thrust vitally important jobs onto you for which you are grossly unqualified.Enjoy!"

The remark was included in a lengthy Golf Magazine feature published Tuesday exploring Trump۪s complicated relationship with the sport. The article also appears in the Aug. 7 issue of Sports Illustrated. But late Wednesday, after widespread criticism for his reported comment, Trump denied calling the White House a dump,۝ labeling the claim as totally untrue.۝ It۪s no secret that Trump enjoys spending time away from the White House at his own resorts.

Trump on Saturday took aim at FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, the second highest ranking official at the bureau who has received many political jabs from the Republican Party in recent years. McCabe faced more than 16 hours of questioning this week from several House committees about his role in the FBI۪s investigations into Russia۪s election meddling and Hillary Clinton۪s private email server, according to CNN. How can [McCabe], the man in charge, along with leakin۪ James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife۪s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation,۝the president tweeted Saturday. Trump also pointed out that McCabe may be retiring soon, as The Washington Post reported Saturday. Early Sunday morning,he referenced a Fox News segment that reported that McCabe allegedly used his FBI Official Email Account to promote[Hillary Clinton۪s] campaign.۝ Trump۪s tweets were an apparent attempt to undermine McCabe۪s credibility in the wake of reports that FBI agent Peter Strzok had sent texts considered politically biased against Trump. Strzok had mentioned Andy,۝ which could be a reference to McCabe, in an August 2016 text message to FBI attorney Lisa Page. Some Republicans believe the text messages show a conspiracy to take down Trump , possibly involving McCabe, according to the Post. Trump۪s tweets also rehashed an alleged controversy surrounding 2016 campaign donations made by Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, an ally of Hillary and Bill Clinton, to McCabe۪s wife, who was running for (and eventually lost) a seat in Virginia۪s Senate. Many Republicans found the donations suspicious and used it to draw ties between the Clintons and McCabe, who oversaw the FBI۪s Clinton email probe. They then called for McCabe۪s firing. McCabe had alerted a department ethics official when the donations were made, according to the Washington Post. Later Saturday, Trump shifted his attention to reports that FBI general counsel James Baker was being reassigned. According to the Post, which first reported the news, Baker۪s reassignment was FBI director Christopher A. Wray۪s attempt to assemble a new team of senior advisers while fending off GOP claims of political bias within the FBI. The president۪s tweets echo the chorus of Republicans on Capitol Hill who have ramped up their criticism of the Department of Justice۪s investigation into ties between Trump۪s campaign and Russia.

When a reporter asked if the subject of Russian election interference came up, Trump replied, He said he absolutely did not meddle in our election. He did not do what they are saying he did. ... Every time he sees me, he says, I didn۪t do that,۪ and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.

Trump told reporters on Saturday that he was skeptical of the intelligence findings and spoke dismissively of several former top Obama officials with long careers in public service.

Michael Flynn was charged with one count of making a false statement to FBI agents and appeared in federal court in D.C. In a criminal information filing from Mueller۪s team, the government alleges that Flynn willfully and knowingly made materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statements۝ in an interview with FBI agents on Jan. 24. It alleges he falsely told the FBI that he did not ask the Russian ambassador to refrain from retaliating to sanctions the Obama administration imposed on Russia in late December. Flynn also allegedly lied about asking the Russian ambassador on Dec. 22 to delay or defeat a pending United Nations Security Council resolution. Considering all of the additional charges Flynn could have faced in connection with his overseas dealings, the fact that he is facing only one charge is an indication that Flynn is offering significant cooperation and information that could further Mueller۪s investigation. The Associated Press and Washington Post reported Friday that Flynn admitted in his plea that he spoke to the Russians at the direction of Trump transition team officials . In response to Friday morning۪s charge, Trump lawyer John Dowd told Wall Street Journal reporter Rebecca Ballhaus : I have no reaction. I don۪t know enough. I۪m not worried about it.۝ White House lawyer Ty Cobb said the plea implicates only Flynn. The false statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year,۝ Cobb said in a statement. Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn. The conclusion of this phase of the Special Counsel۪s work demonstrates again that the Special Counsel is moving with all deliberate speed and clears the way for a prompt and reasonable conclusion.۝ The New York Times reported in late November that Flynn۪s lawyer, Robert Kelner, was no longer sharing information with Trump۪s legal team , further raising the possibility that Flynn was cooperating with Mueller۪s probe. Kelner later met with the investigators , according to ABC News. Flynn۪s indictment follows Mueller۪s team charging Trump۪s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his former aide Rick Gates with 12 counts, including allegations of conspiracy against the U.S. and money laundering. Manafort and Gates pleaded not guilty to the charges and are scheduled to face a federal trial in May. In October, the investigators also reached a plea agreement with former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos , who lied to the FBI about being offered dirt۝ on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election.Papadopoulos also reportedly suggested a meeting between then-candidate Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin last year. But those indictments involved only Trump campaign officials. Flynn is the first former administration official to be charged, making it more difficult for the White House to distance the president from Mueller۪s probe. After Trump fired then-FBI Director James Comey amid his investigation into the campaign, Comey testified that Trump had requested that he end the FBI۪s investigation into Flynn . Flynn, who stepped down as Trump۪s national security adviser in February after lying to administration officials about the extent of his communications with Russian officials, had long faced scrutiny from the multiple investigations into Trump۪s campaign . Of particular interest was Flynn۪s history of suspicious business dealings and financial ties to Russia, as well as his concealing that he worked as a foreign lobbyist for the Turkish government while advising Trump۪s campaign. In the fall of 2016,a businessman with close ties to Turkey۪s autocratic President Recep Tayyip Erdogan paid Flynn more than $500,000 to conduct research aimed at discrediting the exiled cleric Fethullah G_len.Flynn failed to disclose the work until March ,after he had already stepped down as national security adviser. Mueller۪s team has reportedly investigated Flynn۪s lobbying firm and its dealings with Turkey. Flynn also hid multiple contacts with Russia during Trump۪s transition, including discussing sanctions with then-Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. He also attended a meeting with Kislyak to discuss creating a backchannel with Putin . Also in attendance was Trump۪s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who is now a senior White House adviser and also reportedly a subject of Mueller۪s probe.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-passes-tax-bill_us_5a21da79e4b0a02abe91412e","WASHINGTON ۥ When Donald Trump was elected president last year, a sweeping rewrite of the tax code was one of his top priorities. Throughout the campaign, Trump said he wanted a middle-class tax cut,۝ one that wouldn۪t benefit wealthy people like him and would spur huge levels of economic growth while not adding to the national debt. For the hedge fund guys, they۪re going to be paying up,۝ Trump promised in September 2015 . As president, Trump has continued to insist the tax code overhaul won۪t be good for himself or other millionaires. This is going to cost me a fortune, this thing ۥ believe me,۝ Trump said this week . But the big winners in the GOP bill that the Senate passed early Saturday morning are corporations and the wealthy. Trump himself ۥ a self-proclaimed billionaire ۥ stands to gain millions through the elimination of certain taxes (though we don۪t know exactly how much because Trump won۪t release his tax returns). Far from being a middle-class tax cut, the measure is a massive corporate giveaway, a bill that recycles decades of Republican ideology on trickle-down economics and trusts that executives will hand over their new gains to average-income workers. If my friends here want to give a tax cut to the middle class,۝ Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) asked on the Senate floor Thursday, why don۪t we give a tax cut to the middle class?۝ His argument had no effect. After months of negotiations, the Senate passed the proposal, 51-49, with just one Republican ۥ Bob Corker of Tennessee ۥ joining all Democrats in opposition. Corker took issue with how much debt the bill would produce, and after the Senate parliamentarian struck down Corker۪s debt-control proposal , GOP leaders invited the retiring Republican to just vote no rather than finding him an accommodation. With the bill finally through the Senate ۥ the House passed its tax bill two weeks earlier ۥ the two chambers still have to work out their legislative differences in a conference committee before the tax rewrite becomes law. There۪s a slim chance the House could adopt the Senate bill and send it to the president۪s desk, but it۪s more likely that negotiators will merge the two versions. Both chambers need to pass the same measure for the bill to become law. For most Americans, the legislation is still indeed ۥ at least in the short term ۥ a tax cut. Those cuts are due in large part to Republicans approving $1.5 trillion in added debt over the next 10 years. But of that pie, the wealthy disproportionately benefit, and some households could wind up with higher tax bills. The richest 20 percent of households reap 90 percent of the benefit of the tax cuts over that time period, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center . Still, in the short term, it۪s difficult to say exactly whose taxes go up and whose go down. Tax burdens depend on what deductions individual filers claim, and this bill is a complicated tax code rewrite ۥ one that analysts say will have limited impact on the economy, will cost the nation more than a trillion dollars over the next 10 years, and will do much more for rich investors than it will the middle class. Despite all that, despite poll after poll showing the measure is unpopular , most Republicans were ecstatic to pass the bill. While the bill took months to draft, the final package came together over a frenetic last few days . Republicans didn۪t even have finished legislative text until Friday night, hours before the vote, and Democrats slammed their GOP colleagues for rushing through a bill that was cobbled together with handwritten changes and crossed-out pages at the last minute. Those procedural concerns did nothing to slow the bill, however, with Republicans falling in line to vote down a Democratic motion to adjourn Friday night. Senators then began a so-called vote-a-rama,in which amendments get up-or-down approval one after the other until lawmakers are exhausted enough to stop. Eventually, in the early hours of Saturday morning, senators moved to a final vote on the reconciliation bill, and it passed. To get the bill over the 50-vote threshold for reconciliation legislation, GOP leaders cut deals this week on how much certain businesses could deduct off the top of their tax bills, as well as on what would be included in an upcoming government funding measure. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), for example, demanded that year-end spending legislation include funding for Obamacare subsidies that the Trump administration has targeted. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said he got assurances on a contentious immigration program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, though Trump administration officials said Flake only got assurances on being part of the conversation. Overall, the legislation would cut the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent, which has been the GOP۪s priority all along. Republicans say this dramatic reduction will unleash the economy and raise wages by making big businesses more internationally competitive ۥ claims that are dubious according to corporate executives themselves, who say they will throw the money at shareholders instead of workers. In addition to reducing corporate and individual tax rates across the board, the bill would simplify the tax code by getting rid of most deductions, which businesses and individuals use to reduce the amount of their income subject to taxation. Because Congress over the years has added write-offs in order to encourage and subsidize certain endeavors ۥ such as homeownership and higher education ۥ the mass elimination of these tax preferences could have wide-ranging effects that are incidental to the overall Republican goal of encouraging business investment. Axing deductions for state and local taxes, for instance, while increasing the value of a fixed standard deduction,۝ would result in far fewer households finding it worthwhile to deduct the amount they spend on mortgage interest. A study commissioned by the National Association of Realtors earlier this year said the proposal would reduce home values by 10 percent (which could be a good thing for people who don۪t already own homes). Republicans have long championed homeownership but have been undeterred by a lobbying blitz from the real estate industry. While fewer deductions makes for a simpler tax code, the bill would also create a complicated new deduction for certain businesses that aren۪t taxed as corporations. Determining which firms have the kind of qualified business income۝ eligible for the deduction will require many pages of new IRS regulation, though the bill explicitly excludes high-income service providers like accountants, lawyers and investment managers. In the day before the final vote, Republicans increased the value of the deduction to win over Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Steve Daines (R-Mont.), both of whom had previously withheld support because they felt the legislation disproportionately benefited firms that pay the corporate tax. And in a catchall  manager۪s amendment ۝ adopted just before the bill passed, Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) added a provision to allow publicly traded partnerships to claim the new deduction. Victor Fleischer, a tax professor at the University of San Diego School of law, said t hat the Cornyn amendment would specifically benefit oil and gas companies. We should all re-read Why Nations Fail۪ after this tax bill passes,۝ Fleischer said on Twitter . Another provision in the manager۪s amendment, inserted by Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), would have exempted schools that don۪t take federal funds, such as the conservative Hillsdale College in Michigan, from a new tax on college and university endowments. The tax seems designed less to raise money than to poke educated liberals in the eye. Several Republicans joined Democrats in defeating the amendment. Toomey۪s office did not respond to a request for comment. To keep the cost of the bill beneath $1.5 trillion ۥ an arbitrary level Republicans set for themselves in a budget process earlier this year ۥ almost all of the tax cuts for individuals expire at the end of 2025. Republicans say that expiration won۪t happen, noting that even President Barack Obama made nearly all of the Bush tax cuts permanent when they were up for reauthorization. But for all the GOP bluster about this bill being a tax cut for the middle class, and for all the rhetoric about the false necessity of making tax cuts permanent, the bill would keep the corporate tax rates the same while putting the individual rates up for expiration. Because of those temporary cuts, the Joint Committee on Taxation, which scores tax legislation for Congress, found that most households earning less than $75,000 annually would pay higher taxes 10 years from now. Just before debate began Friday night, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said on the Senate floor that this day would be remembered as one of the great robberies in U.S. history.۝ CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported that Toomey۪s Hillsdale carveout had been adopted. This story has also been updated to clarify which industry Fleischer says would benefit from Cornyn۪s amendment."

McMaster used a 1972 photo of Afghan women in miniskirts to show the president that the country had once adopted Western values and to convince him to escalate the war, according to The Washington Post . McMaster reportedly showed Trump a black-and-white snapshot of bare-legged women in Kabul to illustrate that the region might be able to embrace Western ideals again.Miniskirts were replaced by full-body burqas in the mid-1990s, when the Taliban took over Afghanistan, banned Western clothing and rolled back women۪s rights. The Taliban now controls only parts of the country, but many Afghan women still choose to wear traditional burqas because it makes them feel safer from violence and judgment in a society where gender-based violence is rampant. Trump has called the war in Afghanistan a disaster۝ and spent his entire presidential campaign criticizing the United States۪continued involvement in it. His former top adviser, Steve Bannon, also opposed sending more troops to the region and suggested relying on private military contractors instead. But after some urging from McMaster and other top generals, Trump ultimately changed his mind and decided to escalate troop levels by roughly 4,000 . My original instinct was to pull out, and, historically, I like following my instincts,۝ Trump said Monday in a televised address. But all of my life I heard that decisions are much different when you sit behind the desk in the Oval Office.۝ The miniskirt photo reportedly was not the only reason Trump decided to escalate the war, but the anecdote failed to surprise anyone familiar with Trump۪s long history of objectifying women ."

Sports fans and families dug into a menu of chili cheese fries and hot chicken chunks. Servers offered Guinness and Caramel Apple bushwackers. Some people were wearing Halloween costumes. Then, sometime before 7:45 p.m., several dozen men and women dressed in black filed into the restaurant and took over a long table. In an adjoining room of the restaurant, Annelise Werme, a business owner from Murfreesboro,30 miles away, noticed the group۪s attire. The hair on her neck stood up. Our mayor and police chief advised we needed to prepare as if for a hurricane, hoping for the best but preparing for the worst,۝ she told HuffPost in a Facebook message. All of us who own businesses in our historic downtown closed, boarded up.۝ Near the large group, a 30-year-old white woman and a 37-year-old black man were sitting at a table. Several men from the large group started talking to them, another restaurant patron told HuffPost in a phone interview. (He declined to be named, citing safety and privacy concerns.) They were talking about what was good on the menu,۝the patron recalled, noting that a guy in the group wanted anything that was fried.۝ Then, his wife added, some words were exchanged. I don۪t know what was said, but the black man ... he was visibly upset.۝ One member of the black-clad group asked the 30-year-old woman to guess,۝ the woman said later , possibly about who they were. White lives matter,۝ she responded. That۪s right,۝ another member said, then he allegedly urged her to join their table and leave her male friend. They immediately started taunting her for being with a black man,۝ Werme said. Understandably, she was extremely upset.۝ The argument escalated even after the woman went outside. The big group got up to leave. They didn۪t place an order or anything, they were looking for a place to cause some trouble,۝ the first patron said, noting that one person with the group quickly took out a professional camera complete with a shotgun mic. We thought it was all over at that point,۝ his wife said. But about a minute later, they noticed a fight starting outside. Jerry Grim, manager of the Corner Pub,told HuffPost that his business called the police right away. I didn۪t know who they were. They were just a group of men in black puffy jackets. They had no tags, no markers, nothing on them. It could have been anybody.۝ In fact, white supremacists, including neo-Nazis and Klan members, had rallied earlier Saturday in Shelbyville, about an hour away. But they skipped a planned rally in Murfreesboro after being delayed by security in Shelbyville and hearing that nearly 1,000 counter-protesters awaited them . They tried to gather in a nearby park  managing to form a human swastika  but ran when they heard that antifascists might show up,and they had to bail on a planned tiki-torch march. Now a contingent of the white supremacist group had made its way to the restaurant. One of our guys was getting his jacket, and words were exchanged,۝ Matthew Heimbach, a prominent neo-Nazi, told Mic reporter Jack Smith IV. He blamed the black gentleman۝ for starting the confrontation. But video from the incident shows a large group of white men brawling and a woman, with blood dripping down her face, pushed against the window of the sports bar. Inside, some people started to record the fight on their phones, and the environment grew tense as bystanders argued about whether to intervene. Do you want me to go out there and get beat up? Would that be better?۝ A man asked. Oh, my God ... she۪s bleeding,۝ a man said. We were afraid someone was going to be thrown through the window,۝ the unnamed patron۪s wife told HuffPost. It was terrifying.... We didn۪t know if anyone had weapons [or] how far this was going to escalate.۝ Do you speak up? Do you step in and get involved?۝ her husband said. It was kind of difficult to judge what was best to do, because it was a quickly escalating situation. My thought was not to go and make it worse.۝ By the time police arrived, everyone had dispersed. The 30-year-old woman later came back to make a report. Authorities are looking for the man accused of punching her, described as a white man in his 30s wearing a black jacket and black jeans, according to an Oct. 29 statement from the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department that includes the woman۪s account of the incident. (The names of the victims have not been publicly released.) Heimbach said , The confrontation wasn۪t any of us.۝ The woman who made the report said she is still shaken.

And, as if from a dream, Obama came up to her and asked about her adorable 6-month-old daughter, Giselle. Who is this pretty girl?۝ Obama reportedly said. We wish we all could be so lucky during our travels. Obviously, like any good mother, Jackinsky snapped photos of Obama and her daughter. Giselle, with her wide eyes, reacted no different than the rest of us if we were graced with such a chance encounter. In fact, she may have been more composed than any of us would have been. The former president certainly has a special relationship with children. During his presidency, he was photographed dozens of times with kids who were in total awe of him. And now we can be constantly reminded of that fact. Former White House photographer Pete Souza was thankfully there to capture what are arguably Obama۪s most adorable baby moments . And now he posts them to Instagram in really sweet throwbacks. Lucky, lucky babes. Giselle۪s encounter with Obama was quick, but it could have been a much sweeter deal.

And he warns that the president is fueling a violent, anti-media conversation online. Jared Yates Sexton , a New York Times contributor and assistant professor of creative writing at Georgia Southern University, shared with HuffPost several threatening messages directed at him since he unmasked the troll Sunday. In one, a Reddit user warns of a looming journocaust۝  presumably a holocaust for journalists. In another, a Twitter user says there۪s a civil war coming۝ and that memes  specifically, the antisemitic one by the creator of the video that Trump shared  are the least۝ of Sexton۪s problems. There۪s a fever pitch to this dialogue that is dangerous to everybody,۝ Sexton told HuffPost. And it۪s the people who are mentally ill, who are unhinged, who are unwell  they pick up on this stuff. And they are really, really moved to act by it.۝ If we keep this up, there۪s going to be more consequences,۝ he added. That۪s just a fact.۝ The GIF surfaced last week under the Reddit thread  Trump takes down fake news ۝ and appears to have been created by user HanAssholeSolo.۝ It is from a 2007 wrestling clip of then-reality TV star Trump tackling and punching WWE owner Vince McMahon . Superimposed over McMahon۪s head in the GIF, however, is the logo of CNN, a news outlet Trump repeatedly attacks and refers to as fake news.۝ Trump posted a slightly edited version of the clip to Twitter on Sunday morning, which the official @POTUS account retweeted. The video has been widely viewed as the latest example of Trump endorsing violence against the media, which he has called  the enemy of the American people .۝ Following Trump۪s tweet, Sexton revealed in a series of posts to Twitter that HanAssholeSolo has an ugly history of online racism and anti-Semitism. Having written about the rampant homophobia, misogyny and racism at Trump rallies along the campaign trail,Sexton is no stranger to online harassment. But after he exposed the type of person Trump had elevated,Sexton said neo-Nazis and nihilists came out of the woodwork.۝ This violent internet culture is nothing new.What has changed, Sexton told HuffPost, is many in this world feel empowered by and have found a hero of sorts in Trump. And many have embraced the president۪s clear hatred of the press, with calls for bloodshed and civil war. I think a lot of these people have a shared idea that this would be a time where they would basically be able to kill liberals,۝ Sexton said. With a little bit of research what I۪ve found is there are large online havens where they talk about widespread murder of journalists. They fantasize about killing them in the streets, like a revolution. They have terms for it, like day of the rope.۪۝ Sexton has tweeted extensively in the wake of Trump۪s controversial post. He warned about the possibility of Trump getting someone killed . He noted that a little over a month ago, Greg Gianforte, the millionaire Republican running for Montana۪s open congressional seat, was charged with misdemeanor assault after attacking a reporter  and went on to win the election the very next day. And he said the president is  giving power and voice to antisemitic people and emboldening them and their dangerous conspiracies.۝ Sexton said he۪s been subjected to an overwhelming۝ amount of harassment. On Monday, he posted a series of tweets about what journalists are up against in 2017. This environment is the creation of the man in the White House. There are valid criticisms of the media, many on point, this isn۪t that,۝ he added on Twitter. When you start calling a group of people enemies of the country, this is what happens. When you call them scum, this happens.۝ This shouldn۪t be a country where these violent instincts are cultivated and encouraged,۝ he continued. We۪re at a real tipping point right now.But make no mistake, there۪s something growing in this country, and it is very, very ugly.۝ While Sexton۪s inbox and Twitter account were being flooded with threats, HanAssholeSolo was basking in their newfound internet glory.

I wake up and have my morning coffee and who retweets my shitpost but the MAGA EMPORER himself!!!I am honored!!۝ Many other Trump-supporting Reddit users extended congratulations , with one admirer calling HanAssholeSolo a legend.۝ By sharing the meme, Trump hasʉgiven more power to an obvious racist, anti-Semite and misogynist,۝ Sexton told HuffPost; he has sent a clear message that such behavior is acceptable. In a response, CNN said it۪s a sad day when the president of the United States encourages violence against reporters.۝ It called the tweet juvenile behavior far below the dignity of his office.۝ CNN commentator Ana Navarro went a step further, warning Trump  is going to get somebody killed in the media .

In an online culture where sharing of memes and comments is the ultimate validation, this obvious purveyor of hate has been elevated by what can be considered the ultimate share,۝ the group wrote. Sexton said he۪s becoming increasingly concerned about the long-term effects of such hateful discourse. It might be a couple of generations before we actually understand how much damage has been wrought here and what the long-term consequences are,۝ he said.

Less than an hour before, an Alabama judge rejected Moore۪s lawsuit attempting to delay certification of the results, saying that the court did not have the jurisdiction to rule in the case . According to The Associated Press , the suit was filed in Montgomery Circuit Court on Wednesday night, with Moore requesting that the state delay the certification of the election results, launch a fraud investigation and hold a new election. Jones later filed a motion to dismiss Moore۪s lawsuit. Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill (R) said Thursday morning that he had no plans to delay declaring Jones the winner that afternoon. The short answer to that is no,۝ Merrill told CNN . Doug Jones will be certified today.۝ After state officials certified the election results, Jones said in a statement that he is looking forward to going to work for the people of Alabama in the new year.۝ Moore later issued a defiant statement, again blaming Democrats۝ and the Washington establishment۝ for his loss, and claiming without evidence that election fraud experts across the country have agreed that this was a fraudulent election.۝ I have stood for the truth about God and the Constitution for the people of Alabama,۝ Moore said. I have no regrets. To God be the glory.۝ Moore lost the Dec. 12 contest to fill Attorney General Jeff Sessions ۪ vacated Senate seat to Democratic candidate Jones. During the contentious campaign, the former judge faced accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct from multiple women who claimed he preyed on them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. Moore, who was twice removed from the Alabama Supreme Court for failure to follow judicial orders, largely disappeared from the campaign trail in the days leading up to the election. Although the Republican National Committee originally withdrew its formal support of Moore, the party decided to once again fund his campaign after President Donald Trump officially endorsed him . Still, Moore۪s critics urged voters to choose someone else. Just before the election, Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) announced that he did not vote for Moore . I۪d rather see the Republican win, but I۪d rather see a Republican write-in,۝ Shelby told CNN۪s Jake Tapper about the vote he cast two days before the special election. Jones,a civil rights advocate and former prosecutor , ultimately won the race by about 20,000 votes. Following the stunning victory , Jones became Alabama۪s first Democratic senator in 25 years. In the complaint filed Wednesday, Moore۪s lawyers said they are certain voter fraud occurred, and that the only question is whether there was enough to sway the election. Moore۪s lawyers did not elaborate on exactly how they believe fraud occurred. The complaint repeatedly accuses Merrill of not doing enough to investigate voter fraud, but Merrill said Moore۪s campaign had not informed his office of specific allegations to investigate. Merrill said the first he heard about the allegations was late Wednesday evening, shortly before midnight . I did read them. We take all allegations very seriously and we investigate all allegations that are introduced to us,۝ Merrill said in a text message. There۪s also a process for introducing them to us which requires that the complainant complete the form on www.stopvoterfraudnow.com .۝ Moore۪s complaint cites a viral interview with a man the night of the election who indicated in an off-the-cuff comment that people from all over the country had come to vote and canvass for Jones in Alabama. After tracking down the man in the video and determining he was a registered voter in the state, Merrill declared the case was nailed shut.۝ Moore, however, says Merrill should have done more to investigate the claim. The suit also alleges that large numbers of out-of-state voters came to Alabama and illegally voted in the election. It includes a sworn affidavit from a poll worker saying she had never seen so many people vote with out-of-state driver۪s licenses. Alabama law permits people to vote with a state-issued ID from any state . As a supposed example of voter fraud, the complaint also cited an incident where sample ballots filled out for Jones were on display in a probate judge۪s office prior to the election. The ballots were removed after a complaint from Moore, and Merrill said he didn۪t believe the incident was a case of voter fraud . Moore also claimed there was Democratic voter intimidation۝ in the race, pointing to a super PAC ad that incorrectly told Alabamians their votes would be a matter of public record. Google removed the ad from the internet before the election after Merrill complained. Moore also took aim at the higher-than-expected turnout in Jefferson County, the state۪s most populous, saying it was inexplicably substantially higher۝ than places in other parts of the state. Moore implied it was suspicious that turnout in the race far exceeded what was projected. He also pointed to 20 precincts in Jefferson County where he received substantially less of the vote share than the Republican Party.

We are determined to take our country back. We are going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump. That۪s what we believed in, that۪s why we voted for Donald Trump. Because he said he۪s going to take our country back. That۪s what we gotta do.۝ In a tweet, Trump condemned hate۝ and violence۝ in response to clashes at the rally on Saturday, though he did not call out white supremacists in particular. Duke responded to Trump۪s tweet by stating that Trump should remember۝ that White Americans۪ were the ones to put him in office. Duke, a former KKK Grand Wizard, has long connected his message of white supremacy to ideas espoused by the president. During the presidential campaign, Duke stated that he and Trump had similar messages,pointing to Trump proposing policies like a border wall or Muslim ban. Donald Trump is talking implicitly. I۪m talking explicitly,۝ Duke said last year, according to Time. Duke supported Trump۪s campaign and publicly celebrated his lead on election night. Trump disavowed Duke and the KKK , but only after initially declining to do so , claiming he didn۪t know anything about۝ him. This weekend۪s rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, called Unite the Right,۝ was nominally billed as a protest against the removal of a monument to Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. The rally drew out hundreds of demonstrators bearing Nazi symbols and Confederate flags and chanting racist slogans.

In the midst of this current cultural and media climate, I am deeply convinced I would be unable to complete a fair House Ethics investigation before distorted and sensationalized versions of this story would put me, my family, my staff, and my noble colleagues in the House of Representatives through hyperbolized public excoriation.۝ Franks said he has informed House leadership he will resign effective Jan. 31.

Subsequent conversations took place this week between the speaker and Rep. Franks leading to the congressman۪s decision to offer his letter of resignation,۝ the statement said . Franks huddled with colleagues on the House floor late Thursday afternoon. Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) had his arm wrapped around Franks, appearing to be consoling him.

He has led the charge, year after year, to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy nationwide and to limit abortion in the District of Columbia. Residents of D.C. protested his efforts in 2012 by lining up outside the Arizona congressman۪s office with plastic rats and photos of pot holes, suggesting that he try to fix more pressing problems in the city than women having abortions. Franks also caused an uproar in 2013 when he claimed during an abortion debate that the incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low,۝ defending his bill۪s lack of an exception for rape and incest victims. The congressman is notorious for comparing abortion to slavery and the Holocaust .ʉWhat changed peoples mind over slavery?۝ he asked during a 2013 debate on the D.C. anti-abortion bill. What changed their minds over the tragedy in Eastern Europe, the horror in Eastern Europe?۝ Franks further incensed minority rights groups last year when he introduced legislation to impose criminal penalties on doctors who are suspected of performing abortions based on the race or sex of the fetus, which they warned would codify dangerous stereotypes against women of color.

In a pair of tweets targeting Mitch M۝ and Paul R,۝ Trump accused them of creating a mess۝ in the challenge Congress faces to raise the federal debt ceiling when lawmakers return from recess in September. The U.S. Treasury is due to hit the debt ceiling at some point in October, and a failure to raise it to pay the government۪s bills could spur financial chaos. But hard-core conservative Republicans in Congress could block raising the ceiling by insisting such legislation include big cuts in federal spending. Trump has repeatedly lambasted GOP lawmakers for supposedly not working with him on legislative priorities, such as the debt ceiling and tax reform. Yet his lack of overtures toward them and continuing attacks perhaps are further worsening relations. On Tuesday night at a raucous rally in Arizona , the president threatened a government shutdown if Congress does not provide funding for his signature campaign promise, a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrats have stressed that they remain unalterably opposed to such funding. Trump at his rally also repeatedly attacked Republican lawmakers and singled out McConnell, telling the crowd, We have to speak to Mitch.۝ Trump and McConnell reportedly have had a particularly frosty relationship, with the two men having not spoken for weeks, according to The New York Times . Trump, particularly angered by the multiple investigations into whether his campaign colluded with Russia in last year۪s election, reportedly yelled at McConnell for not doing more to protect him۝ from the probes, the Times reported. On Wednesday, both the White House and McConnell۪s office pushed back against the article, releasing carefully worded statements that insisted that their relationship was fine. We are committed to advancing our shared agenda together and anyone who suggests otherwise is clearly not part of the conversation,۝ McConnell said. The White House similarly asserted that Trump and McConnellʉremain united on many shared priorities.۝ Yet an hour after his original tweets on Thursday, Trump again complained about McConnell, going after him for Republicans۪ failed efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which the GOP has long promised. In addition to antagonizing McConnell, Trump has drawn ire from Republican leaders for criticizing GOP senators up for re-election next year, especially Jeff Flake of Arizona and Dean Heller of Nevada . In Flake۪s case, he has also met with and praised a candidate planning to challenge the incumbent in next year۪s Republican primary.

Trump۪s pardon claim came after The Washington Post reported that he had inquired with his lawyers about how pardons work and speculation he is considering pardons for aides, his family, and even potentially himself. It۪s unclear if he actually could legally pardon himself. The Constitution۪s presidential pardon provision does not explicitly ban the president from doing so. But Elizabeth Holtzman , a former Democratic congresswoman who served on the House Judiciary Committee during the Watergate scandal, argued in a Post op-ed this month that the president pardoning himself would undermine the entire constitution. A presidential self-pardoning power would seriously undermine the rule of law. If presidents could self-pardon, they could engage in monstrously wrongful and criminal conduct with impunity,۝ she wrote. That would utterly violate the framers۪ belief in a limited presidency and in the idea that no president is above the law.۝ Amid reports the White House is gearing up to try and discredit an investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russia ties, Trump also questioned why investigators weren۪t looking into potential offenses he alleged his 2016 Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton and James Comey , the former FBI director, may have committed. The FBI did investigate Clinton۪s use of a private email server during the presidential campaign and concluded it would not bring charges against her . Trump also addressed an August 2015 comment by Anthony Scaramucci , his new communications director , in which Scaramucci called him a hack politician.۝ Scaramucci apologized for the comment Friday and said the president brings it up with him every 15 seconds.۝ The comment apparently was still on Trump۪s mind Saturday, because he said Scaramucci had always wanted to endorse him."

Trump signed a memo banning transgender individuals from newly enlisting in the military and pardoned a former sheriff with a history of racist actions . One of his most controversial advisers resigned, and his administration teased they۪d end a program that could put many young undocumented immigrants at risk of deportation. These controversial announcements all came as Hurricane Harvey bore down on the Texas Gulf Coast. The barrage of news coming from the White House, with each story notable in its own right, illustrated both an administration prone to crisis and ill-equipped to handle them, whether natural or self-made. The U.S. news was largely dominated by Hurricane Harvey throughout the day Friday, as the storm quickly escalated from Category 2 to Category 4, with winds escalating to 130 miles per hour. Millions of Texans were urged to flee their homes, with Republican Gov. Greg Abbott encouraging people to evacuate even if it wasn۪t mandatory . It is not hyperbole to say that if the forecast verifies, Texas is about to experience one of the worst natural disasters in the history of the state,۝ Abbott said Friday in a written request for Trump to declare a major disaster. Trump wished Texans  good luck ۝ as he departed the White House on Friday for Camp David in Maryland. But he and his administration seemed eager to use the natural disaster as a distraction. Just after 6 p.m. EDT Friday, Military Times reported that Trump signed a memo banning transgender men and women from enlisting in the military.The presidential memo also tasks Defense Secretary Jim Mattis with determining whether to remove already enlisted transgender individuals from service, and it bars the military from funding gender confirmation surgery. Trump۪s initial announcement that transgender individuals wouldn۪t be allowed to serve, made in a July 26 series of tweets with no input from the Department of Defense, was widely criticized by military officials , members of the armed forces and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle . Then, just after 8 p.m., the White House issued a statement that Trump had pardoned Joe Arpaio , the former sheriff of Maricopa County in Arizona. Arpaio had been found in contempt of court for violating a judge۪s order and unlawfully detaining individuals his officers claimed might be in the country illegally. He became infamous for making inmates in his jails wear pink underwear and sleep in tents when temperatures at times topped 110 degrees. Trump and Arpaio worked together to try to disprove Barack Obama ۪s ability to serve as president, with Arpaio leading an  investigation ۝into the authenticity of Obama۪s birth certificate that Trump once praised as successful.۝ In his statement Friday, Trump called Arpaio a worthy candidate for a Presidential pardon,۝ the first of Trump۪s presidency. Trump does have the constitutional authority to issue pardons, but the timing of Arpaio۪s pardon caused many to question Trump۪s priorities. Trump۪s pardon, given to a man widely seen as racist, came at a time when many are still criticizing the president۪s response to the white supremacist protests in Charlottesville, Virginia. Trump۪s initial unwillingness to explicitly condemn racists was so widely panned that Trump felt a need to defend his responses in a 20-minute rant at a Phoenix rally Tuesday. And according to WTSP۪s Noah Pransky and CNN, Trump deliberately timed the announcement of Arpaio۪s pardon to come Friday evening ۥ Arpaio۪s lawyer found out about the pardon at 6 p.m. Eastern Friday, and the announcement wasn۪t made until 8 p.m. Eastern time, a full two hours later and a mere 30 minutes after Hurricane Harvey was upgraded to a Category 4 storm. Trump teased the pardon of Arpaio on Tuesday night at the Phoenix rally but said he wouldn۪t grant the pardon then because he didn۪t want to cause any controversy.۝ Also late Friday, it was announced that Sebastian Gorka, a controversial adviser to Trump, had left his White House job. There were also reports throughout Friday afternoon that Trump was considering ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), which would strip legal work permits from hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. In any other administration, any one of these announcements could have dominated the news cycle for days. In the Trump era, however, it appears every action was taken to ensure these decisions would be buried by Saturday, when the destruction of Harvey takes over.

Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, authored an op-ed on the anti-abortion website LifeNews.com on Monday touting the legislation. All of usRepublicans, Democrats, and Independentscan agree that the government has a vested interest in protecting the rights of children,۝ Goodlatte wrote, and that should include unborn children after 20 weeks.۝ Yet Republicans in Congress just missed a deadline to reauthorize the Children۪s Health Insurance Program, which helped states provide insurance coverage to 9 million children in low-income families. The Senate had put forth a bipartisan, 5-year bill to renew the program, but didn۪t schedule a vote in time,instead prioritizing legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare.

It۪s tantamount to Mother Nature۪s atomic bomb, and we۪re doing very little,۝ said Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-N.M.), who chairs the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, in asking her colleagues to expedite aid to the U.S. territory last week. Trump criticized Puerto Ricans for not doing more to help themselves after the devastating hurricane and lamented the logistical challenges of providing aid to the island. But the White House applauded House lawmakers for acting on abortion. The Administration strongly supports the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, and applauds the House of Representatives for continuing its efforts to secure critical pro-life protections,۝ the White House said in a statement on Monday night. The legislation passed the House by a 237-189 vote, but it is very unlikely to become law because it lacks the needed 60 votes to make it through the Senate. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said Tuesday that the bill is dead on arrival۝ and excoriated her colleagues across the aisle for prioritizing it. Is the House working on helping families who have lost their loved ones and livelihoods in Puerto Rico? No,۝ she said.

He accused the media of trying to take away our history, our heritage,۝ and threatened to shut down the federal government in order to get funding for a wall between the United States and Mexico. CNN commentators said it was difficult to watch Trump speak and not question whether he was fit for office. They discussed the 25th Amendment , which allows for the vice president to initiate a process by which the president can be removed from office if his Cabinet deems him to be unfit. There was no sanity there. He was like a child blaming a sibling on something else,۝ CNN۪s Don Lemon said immediately after the rally.

Maria Cardona, a CNN political contributor, said Tuesday that Trump might be psychotically demented.۝ I do believe that after tonight a lot of people are going to be thinking that he۪s not just completely unfit, that he۪s just completely ill-equipped to hold this office but that he might be psychotically demented and ill of the mind in order to take this office and in order to continue with this office,۝ she said. Lawmakers have also questioned Trump۪s competence. The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful. And we need for him to be successful, our nation needs for him to be successful,۝ Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) told reporters last week. Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) has called for Trump to be removed from office using the 25th Amendment . Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) introduced a resolution calling for Trump to undergo a mental health exam."

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/katharine-gorka-life-after-hate_us_59921356e4b09096429943b6","WASHINGTON ۥ Weeks before a violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, led to three deaths and 19 injuries, the Trump administration revoked a grant to Life After Hate, a group that works to de-radicalize neo-Nazis. The Department of Homeland Security had awarded the group $400,000 as part of its Countering Violent Extremism program in January, just days before former President Barack Obama left office. It was the only group selected for a grant that focused exclusively on fighting white supremacy.But the grant money was not immediately disbursed. Trump aides, including Katharine Gorka, a controversial national security analyst known for her anti-Muslim rhetoric, were already working toward eliminating Life After Hate۪s grant and to direct all funding toward fighting what the president has described as radical Islamic terrorism.۝ In December, Gorka, then a member of Trump۪s transition team, met with George Selim,the DHS official who headed the Countering Violent Extremism program until he resigned last month, and his then-deputy, David Gersten. Gorka told Selim and Gersten she didn۪t agree with the Obama administration۪s approach to countering violent extremism ۥ particularly the way the administration had described the threat of extremism, according to Nate Snyder, an Obama administration DHS counterterrorism official who was an adviser on Countering Violent Extremism efforts and was given a readout of the meeting.The Trump administration has repeatedly criticized the previous administration for avoiding terms like radical Islam۝ out of concern that it could alienate Muslims in the U.S. and abroad. That was sort of foreshadowing what was going to come,۝Snyder said of the December meeting. Gorka and Selim did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Katharine Gorka has been integral in helping the Department broaden efforts to focus on all forms of extremism. Her work includes efforts to address everything from global jihadists threats to domestic terrorists,۝ Anna Franko, a DHS spokeswoman, wrote in an email. Gorka and her husband, Sebastian Gorka, also a Trump White House official, have collaborated on numerous writings about the threat of radical Islam. Though they have a large following within far-right circles ۥ they both have bylines at Breitbart News ۥ mainstream national security experts are either unfamiliar with or critical of their work. The day after Trump won the election, Sebastian Gorka said , I predict with absolute certitude, the jettisoning of concepts such as CVE.۝ Once Trump entered the White House in January, the office of then-DHS Secretary John Kelly ordered a full review of the Countering Violent Extremism program. Kelly۪s office wanted to re-vet the groups receiving a portion of the $10 million Congress had appropriated for the program  even though DHS had already publicly announced the grant recipients. While that review was underway, DHS and the FBI warned in an internal intelligence bulletin of the threat posed by white supremacy. White supremacists were responsible for 49 homicides in 26 attacks from 2000 to 2016 _ more than any other domestic extremist movement,۝ the two agencies wrote in a May 10 document obtained by Foreign Policy . Members of the white supremacist movement likely will continue to pose a threat of lethal violence over the next year,۝ they concluded. Staffers in the Countering Violent Extremism program have long pushed for it to address threats from domestic terrorists, including white supremacists. But when DHS published a new list of award recipients on June 23, there was no mention of Life After Hate. DHS also revoked funding from the Muslim Public Affairs Council, an American Muslim advocacy organization that was told in January it would receive a $393,800 grant to create community resource centers throughout the country. After publishing its new list of grantees, DHS told Muslim Public Affairs Council that it was now prioritizing organizations that worked with law enforcement. The money that was initially set aside for community-based groups like Muslim Public Affairs Council and Life After Hate will now go to several law enforcement agencies. Is this really just a front for targeting the Muslim community?۝ asked Omar Noureldin, Muslim Public Affairs Council۪s vice president. Noureldin is now looking into whether the Trump administration۪s use of the Countering Violent Extremism program۪s funds violates congressional appropriation intent. Less than two months after DHS announced it was pulling funding from Life After Hate, James Alex Fields Jr., a 20-year-old Ohioan, traveled to Charlottesville, Virginia, to join white supremacists armed with long guns , waving Nazi and Confederate flags and protesting the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a local park. Fields is now accused of ramming a Dodge Challenger into a crowd of pedestrians on Saturday, and has since been charged with second-degree murder for the death of 32-year-old counterprotester Heather Heyer. Dozens of others were injured, and two Virginia state troopers died in a helicopter crash while monitoring the violent demonstration. Life After Hate was founded by former white supremacists who have renounced the racist ideology and who now help others transition out of hate groups and re-assimilate into society. Christian Piccolini, a former neo-Nazi and a co-founder of the group, told NPR on Sunday he was not surprised by the devastation in Charlottesville. The white supremacy movement has been growing, but it۪s also been shape-shifting,۝ Piccolini said. It۪s gone from what we would have considered very open neo-Nazis and skinheads and KKK marching, to now people that look like our neighbors, our doctors, our teachers, our mechanics.۝ And it۪s certainly starting to embolden them, because a lot of the rhetoric that۪s coming out of the White House today is so similar to what we preached ... but in a slightly more palatable way,۝ he added. As the violence in Charlottesville unfolded on Saturday, Trump condemned this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence, on many sides,۝ adding that the problem existed during the Obama administration. The president ignored several calls to specifically denounce white supremacists and neo-Nazis who said they were working to fulfill Trump۪s campaign promises. It wasn۪t until Monday, two days after the violent rally, that Trump specifically denounced the [Ku Klux Klan], neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups.۝ Trump۪s hesitancy to disavow white supremacists echoes his practice of repeatedly dodging questions about David Duke, a former KKK grand wizard who supported Trump, during the 2016 presidential campaign. Facing public pressure, Trump eventually distanced himself from the infamous white supremacist. Now in the White House, Trump has surrounded himself with an array of people tied to white supremacist, anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant groups. Katharine Gorka, now an adviser in the Department of Homeland Security۪s policy office, has pushed conspiracy theories about the Muslim Brotherhood infiltrating the government and media. Sebastian Gorka is a deputy assistant to the president and has described Islam as an inherently violent religion. He argued days before the Charlottesville attack that white supremacy is not the problem۝ facing the country. Stephen Miller , Trump۪s speechwriter and policy adviser, has blamed the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks on poor immigration enforcement, and accused black students of racial paranoia.۝ National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton wrote under a pseudonym that Islam is incompatible with the modern West,۝ and that diversity is a source of weakness, tension, and disunion.۝ And Trump himself campaigned for president on the platform of banning Muslims from traveling to the U.S. and building a wall to keep Mexicans out ۥ proposals that won him enthusiastic support from white supremacists. DHS did not directly respond to a questions about why it cut funding for de-radicalizing neo-Nazis, and whether it views white supremacy as an extremist threat. Sixteen of the 26 groups that received DHS funding have applicability to all forms of violent extremism and as such will address the threat of domestic terrorism,۝ Franko, the DHS spokeswoman, wrote. America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know what۪s going on.

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jared-kushner-trump-alabama_us_59ccea6fe4b0210dfdfc60ea","Once again,President Donald Trump finds himself in trouble after taking political advice from his son-in-law. Over the last few months, Jared Kushner , who is also a White House senior adviser, was chief among those who lobbied the president to endorse Luther Strange, the losing candidate in Tuesday۪s Republican Senate primary in Alabama. According to two sources who work closely with the young real estate tycoon, Kushner suggested the endorsement, in part, because he believed that a Strange victory would enrage Steve Bannon , the newly reinstalled executive chairman of Breitbart News and a nemesis of Kushner۪s from their time together in the Trump White House. Bannon backed the primary winner, Roy Moore,who thinks that homosexuality should be criminalized and suggested this week that parts of the United States are operating under Sharia. Kushner also thought that getting Trump to support Strange would improve his own tenuous standing with Republican leaders in the Senate, according to several allies of Bannon. He۪s going to need them if things go south in the Russia investigation,۝ one explained. The senatorial primary between Strange and Moore was widely viewed as a proxy war between the Republican Party۪s establishment forces and its white nationalist fringe. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the Senate majority leader, strongly supported Strange. Bannon, on the other hand, suggested at a rally for Moore on Monday that a reckoning is coming۝ not just for McConnell, but for all the donors۝ and corporatists۝ he believes run the party. That Trump ultimately supported Strange , tweeting on his behalf and attending a campaign event for him last week, was puzzling to many of the president۪s supporters, given his strained relationship with McConnell and his sympathies for Bannon۪s populist worldview. Presidents rarely endorse one candidate over another in a primary election. But Kushner was a critical early voice in convincing the president to take a side. McConnell and Rick Dearborn, the White House deputy chief of staff, also were instrumental at various points in the process. Sources close to Bannon noted that Trump first tweeted about Strange on Aug. 8 , when Kushner was with the president at his country club in Bedminster, New Jersey. No senior adviser to the president in their right mind would ever lead the president to get involved in a primary, let alone a highly contested one that pitted his own base against him,۝ said Sam Nunberg, a former adviser to Trump ۥ and a close friend of Bannon۪s. Anyone with a pulse knew that Luther was going to lose the runoff. Luther barely survived the primary.۝ The president hadn۪t paid attention to the race until recently. According to three sources with direct knowledge, when Moore emerged victorious in the three-candidate first round of voting last month, winning 39 percent, Trump asked confidants: Who۪s he?۝ Kushner started advocating for Trump to back Strange after speaking with veteran Republican strategist Jeff Roe. Roe, who is friendly with Kushner, ran Sen. Ted Cruz۪s (R-Texas) presidential campaign in 2016 and was hired by Strange earlier this year. Roe sent Kushner emails loaded with polling data that suggested Strange would win easily over Moore and the third candidate in August۪s primary election, Rep. Mo Brooks. Kushner forwarded those emails to appropriate parties,۝ a White House official said. Kushner was also alerted to the fact that Brooks had called Trump a serial adulterer۝ during the 2016 primary, when Brooks was supporting Cruz. Trump, several sources say, had no idea that Brooks disparaged him until Kushner passed along the news, and it sunk any chances of Trump endorsing him. (The White House official denied this, saying Kushner never spoke about Brooks or the Alabama race to the president.) Backing Strange, then, seemed like an obvious choice to Kushner. Several sources close to both Moore and Bannon said they believe Kushner wanted to show McConnell that he had real influence with the president ۥ and that he wanted to show Trump he knew how to win. All Jared thinks about is beating Bannon,۝ said a well-connected friend of the Breitbart chief. It consumed him before Bannon left the White House, and it consumes him now.۝ That sentiment was confirmed to me by a source who knows Kushner well and has a more positive view of him. (The White House official dismissed the anti-Bannon notion as totally untrue.۝) But Kushner misread the mood of Alabama Republicans. Moore won this week۪s race by 10 percentage points. And shortly thereafter, ProPublica discovered that Trump had deleted his previous tweets supporting Strange. According to CNN, Trump went to bed on Tuesday night embarrassed and pissed.۝ Breitbart wasted little time in highlighting Kushner۪s awful advice.۝ An article Wednesday noted that Kushner has a disturbing pattern۝ of getting the president in trouble, referencing Kushner۪s suggestion that Trump fire former FBI director James Comey. This time, according to Breitbart , Kushner stands accused of dividing Trump from his base. He has succeeded in doing the only thing that could be fatal to Trump۪s presidency and re-election prospects  driven a wedge between the president and his supporters.۝ What۪s clear, explained someone who has good relations with both Bannon and Kushner, is that the feud between the two of them shows no signs of dying downʉۥ and that Bannon۪s side will offer little grace in victory. Kushner wants to show Trump he is the smarter of the two, but it is not working,۝ said a friend of Bannon۪s. Two sources confirmed that Trump told confidants Tuesday night that while he is not pleased that Bannon۪s candidate won, he is not upset at his former strategic adviser. What he feels about Kushner and his role in the Alabama fiasco is not known."

Mueller, who is leading the Justice Department۪s investigation as special prosecutor, is a former FBI director, which critics say creates a conflict of interest in the case. He also previously worked with former FBI director James Comey, who President Donald Trump fired in May amid the agency۪s investigation into Russian interference. David N. Kelley, Comey۪s attorney,has disputed Trump۪s claim that Comey and Mueller were close friends, maintaining that the pair were friends in the sense that co-workers are friends.۝ The GOP has long complained about Mueller۪s supposed lack of objectivity. But this week, demands urging him to quit escalated in the wake of reports that the Democratic National Convention and the Hillary Clinton campaign funded opposition research that turned up a secret dossier on Trump and his alleged Russia ties. On Thursday the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal ۥ a crown jewel in the media empire of Rupert Murdoch, a close Trump ally  went after Mueller as well. It wrote that the dossier news raises the question of whether the document helped fuel the FBI۪s probe into Trump۪s campaign. Since the dossier attributes allegations to Kremlin-connected sources,۝ the board argues that would mean the FBI could have been essentially acting on disinformation۝ provided by Russia. And if there were a need to investigate the FBI۪s actions, that would make Mueller۪s FBI ties a major conflict of interest. The federal code could not be clearer  Mueller is compromised by his apparent conflict of interest in being close with James Comey,۝ Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz) said in a statement to Fox News on Friday. The appearance of a conflict is enough to put Mueller in violation of the code.۝ Friday morning, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) said on Fox and Friends۝ that somebody with Bob Mueller۪s integrity۝ should step aside.۝ Trump has also tweeted that the FBI may have helped pay for the dossier directly, though there۪s no apparent evidence this is true. Meanwhile, journalist Carl Bernstein  best known for his work with Bob Woodward reporting on the Watergate scandal is accusing Trump of trying to sabotage۝ Mueller۪s investigation. The Russians interfered in our electoral process, and there is an investigation into whether Donald Trump and those around him had foreknowledge of those attempts, and what their relationships were with Russians, business relationships that might have made them vulnerable to Russian objectives,۝ Bernstein said on Don Lemon۪s CNN Tonight۝ on Friday.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-flynn-trump-russia-mueller-probe_us_5a219c0fe4b03c44072d64bc","WASHINGTON ۥ Former national security adviser Michael Flynn , the man President Donald Trump trusted with the nation۪s closest-held secrets, is now a felon, admitting in federal court Friday that he lied to FBI agents just days after his former boss was sworn in as president.But it۪s actually the relative non-severity of the charge against Flynn that should have Trump and his top aides worried. Flynn, who served as Trump۪s national security adviser for 24 days before he was fired for reportedly lying to Vice President Mike Pence about the content of his discussions with the Russian ambassador weeks before Trump۪s inauguration, had significant legal exposure. As did his son Michael Flynn Jr. So the fact that he struck a plea deal with just a single count that could potentially mean no prison time indicates he۪s been able to leverage significant information on an even bigger target. In short, special counsel Robert Mueller ۪s team isn۪t done yet. Usually in government investigations they don۪t cooperate down, they cooperate up,۝ Mark Lee , a former federal prosecutor, told HuffPost. Gen. Flynn is probably a medium-sized fish. They۪re looking for a bigger fish than him.۝ Trump has dismissed Mueller۪s probe as a witch hunt۝ and a hoax,۝ and the White House is already trying to distance the administration from Flynn .But the investigation has already resulted in two guilty pleas ۥ from Flynn and former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos ۥ as well as hefty criminal charges against Trump۪s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his deputy Rick Gates. Now, armed with the cooperation of Flynn and Papadopoulos and with significant leverage against Manafort and Gates, Mueller۪s team appears poised for another takedown. Flynn would not be permitted to enter a plea bargain unless he had substantial credible evidence of criminal activity involving high-level members of the Trump campaign, including potentially the president himself,۝ Notre Dame Law School professor Jimmy Gurul̩ said. Clearly this is not good news for President Trump.۝ Two individuals specifically referenced in court documents in connection with Flynn۪s guilty plea Friday should be particularly nervous. First, there۪s a senior official۝ on the Trump transition team who was at Trump۪s Mar-a-Lago resort on Dec. 29. According to his statement of offense , Flynn made a call that day to a senior official۝ who was with other senior members۝ of the transition team at Mar-a-Lago. This was the day after the Obama administration had announced sanctions against Russia in response to Russia۪s interference in the 2016 election and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak had contacted Flynn for a chat. In that Dec. 29 call, Flynn and other members of the Trump transition team, according to the statement of offense, discussed the U.S. Sanctions, including the potential impact of those sanctions on the incoming administration۪s foreign policy goals.۝Then, immediately۝ after talking to the official, Flynn called the Russian ambassador and asked that Russia not escalate the situation. Fox News , CNN and ABC reported Friday that K.T. McFarland,a former top administration official Trump has nominated to become an ambassador, was the senior official۝ in question. Second, there۪s the very senior member of the Presidential Transition Team۝ who, on Dec. 22, directed Flynn to call other countries, including Russia, to learn where governments stood on a U.N. Security Council resolution on Israeli settlements. Multiple outlets have reported that this is Jared Kushner, Trump۪s son-in-law and adviser. Flynn, according to his statement of offense, requested that Russia either vote against or delay the resolution. Flynn admitted he lied when he told FBI agents that he asked only for their position on the vote and didn۪t request they take any particular action. Flynn۪s admissions that he acted on behalf of the Trump transition team to interfere with U.S. foreign policy raises the potential of charges under the Logan Act, a never-used 1799 statute than bans citizens from interfering in foreign relations, as well as potential other criminal statutes. As part of his plea deal, Flynn has agreed to cooperate fully, truthfully, completely, and forthrightly۝ with Mueller۪s office or any other federal, state and local law enforcement authorities Mueller۪s office identifies where Flynn۪s cooperation would be relevant.

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-to-end-daca-report-politico_us_59acaa61e4b0b5e530ff6e88","WASHINGTON ۥPresident Donald Trump plans to end an Obama-era program that protects young undocumented immigrants from deportation, according to multiple reports. But the decision wouldn۪t take effect for six months, raising the prospect that Trump could change his mind or Congress could work on a legislative solution ۥ and prolonging uncertainty for hundreds of thousands of people protected by the program. On Sunday, Politico and Reuters reported that Trump plans to eventually terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which grants work permits and protections for so-called Dreamers, or undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children. There will be a six-month delay to any enforcement of the president۪s decision, unnamed sources told Politico and Reuters , which would give Trump ample time to reverse his decision or decline to follow through on it. Otherwise, Congress would have to pass legislation during that gap if they want to keep protections for DACA recipients in place. Dreamers might not know for months whether or how their lives could be upended. The White House is expected to officially announce Trump۪s decision on Tuesday. The decision would run against the recommendation of some Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who said Friday that Trump should keep DACA in place while Congress works on a legislative solution. The program, often referred to as DACA, allows undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. before they turned 16 to apply for two-year work authorization and reprieve from deportation. Since President Barack Obama created DACA in 2012, nearly 800,000 people have been granted those protections, which meant they could obtain driver۪s licenses, work legally and live without the imminent threat of being returned to countries they hadn۪t seen since childhood. Trump۪s decision comes ahead of an informal Sept. 5 deadline set by state attorneys general who threatened legal action if the president did not suspend DACA by that time. But supporters of DACA, including members of Congress and immigrant rights groups, said Trump could have fought for the program in court ۥ or even waited to see if the states actually followed through on a legal challenge. They made a last-ditch push to persuade him to maintain DACA. Instead, the president۪s decision could put those hundreds of thousands of Dreamers in limbo. Trump said repeatedly during his presidential campaign that he would end DACA ۥ which he argued was unconstitutional ۥ immediately upon becoming president. But he also spoke often about Dreamers in a vague but positive way, hinting that he favored action to support them. Last December, Trump said he would  work something out ۝ for Dreamers. In February, he said he would  show great heart _ toward them. In April, he said Dreamers should  rest easy ۝ because his focus was deporting criminals. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Thursday ahead of the announcement that Trump absolutely۝ stood by his commitment to treat Dreamers with heart. The president has kept DACA going for months in spite of his previous claims that it was illegal. From January through March, during most of which he was president, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services approved nearly 125,000 people for DACA, most of them for renewal. DACA recipients have not been entirely safe, however, under the Trump administration. Immigrant rights advocates said there has been an uptick in the detention of Dreamers since the president took over and began an expansion of deportation efforts. Without DACA,all Dreamers would be at risk of deportation. Trump officials have said no individuals are exempt from removal, and have sought to deport people who merely cross their paths even if they haven۪t otherwise committed a crime. Trump wants to deport more undocumented immigrants, and more DACA recipients will likely be among them. There could also be major economic implications. If DACA recipients are unable to renew their work permits, nearly 700,000 people who are currently employed would exit the workforce. An average of 1,400 people would lose work authorization each business day and more than 6,000 could be fired in the first week alone, according to a recent report by FWD.us and the Center for American Progress, both supporters of the program. Deporting Dreamers is not a popular move ۥ even among Republicans and Trump supporters, according to polling . Nearly two-thirds of all Americans support DACA,according to a NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll .That means there is a chance Congress will step in and protect Dreamers, although it۪s not clear the White House would buy in without major concessions from Democrats on a border wall, immigration enforcement and cuts to legal immigration. Such a deal was reportedly being pushed by top White House officials, but Democrats quickly shot it down at the time, saying Dreamers should not be used as bargaining chips. The White House has not supported other bipartisan efforts to help Dreamers that don۪t have additional items attached, such as the stopgap Bridge Act, which would temporarily extend protections, or the Dream Act, which would put them on a path to legal status and potential citizenship. Congressional Republicans have repeatedly blocked efforts to grant legal protections to Dreamers, but will be under increased pressure to do so after Trump۪s announcement. Ahead of the decision, some Republican lawmakers said they planned to work on more legislation that focuses on Dreamers. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) intends to introduce what some backers are touting as a conservative version of the Dream Act, called the Recognizing America۪s Children, or RAC Act, which was already introduced in the House and would grant legal status to a slightly narrower category of young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Ryan, the House speaker, said Friday he also wants to pass a bill on Dreamers. There are people in limbo,۝ Ryan said on WCLO radio in Janesville, Wisconsin. These are kids that know no other country, who were brought here by their parents and don۪t know another home, and so I really do believe there needs to be a legislative solution, that۪s one that we۪re working on.۝"

Kaepernick, a free agent, hasn۪t signed with a team this year and analysts have blamed his advocacy.

The president۪s attempt at a joke was quickly condemned by politicians and Native American leaders . Later,ABC News reporter Jon Karl asked White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders why Trump felt the need to say something that is offensive to many people while honoring the Navajo code talkers, these genuine American heroes?۝ Sanders claimed the term wasn۪t a racial slur, even though Trump has been criticized in the past for repeatedly using it against Warren, who made unverified claims that she had Native American heritage during her 2012 Senate run. On Tuesday, the younger Trump attempted to defend his presidential pop with a tweet he probably meant to burn Dad۪s detractors on Twitter for good.  Many people quickly responded that the young Trump۪s reasoning was a truly staggering example of stupidity. A few explained the difference between making a movie about a real-life Native American is a lot different than using the name of that person to insult someone else. Some couldn۪t help but add a bit of snark to this teachable moment.۝ Others used blunt reasoning. Some had questions of their own.

Adams, then 19, joined Hillary Clinton۪s campaign and Salsbury, then 18, joined Sen. Bernie Sanders۪ campaign.They were ready to make the world a better place by helping to elect their candidate. But each woman says she was sexually harassed by a fellow campaign worker  and that both campaigns were ill-equipped to address the allegations. Their stories show how political campaigns can prey on the same young people who power them with their work and energy. Even as Adams and Salsbury came forward to tell their stories, each requested that her alleged harasser not be named, citing safety and professional concerns. In Clinton۪s Campaign Adams signed on to the Clinton campaign as an intern at its Brooklyn, New York, headquarters in October 2015. She wore many hats: I was on the digital organizer team and an assistant to the digital director, the deputy digital director, the chief digital officer and the [chief technical officer],۝ she said. Seven months later, in May 2016, she relocated to Colorado to work with the state Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign as a paid organizer. Her job connected the two, promoting the former secretary of state and other Democrats on the state۪s ballot. It was in the Colorado office that Adams said she faced harassment from a fellow organizer. Adams said she dealt with this harassment for months and mentioned it to a superior as early as June. The abuse began as homophobic remarks  Adams felt targeted, she said, because the man knew she was bisexual  and escalated from there. He made multiple comments about my body, told people we were dating, would constantly try to get me to drink (I was 19), try to force me into situations where we were alone, encouraged me not to wear bras, etc.,۝ Adams said. HuffPost reached out for comment from the individual accused of harassment but received no reply. A person Adams confided in at the time, speaking on background, confirmed her account. By August, Adams said she۪d lost hope that the harassment would end or that her harasser would finally back away because she wasn۪t interested in him. She again reached out to her superiors and asked them to take action. The campaign fired her harasser shortly thereafter. In text messages between Adams and one of her superiors, which were reviewed by HuffPost, they both expressed relief that the problem was over. But even after her abuser was fired, his work with the party  and the campaign  wasn۪t over. In October 2016, Adams said she discovered to her astonishment that he had been rehired the previous month to work on the campaign with a different state party. So he was technically fired but still ended up working for Hillary via the [other state] Democratic Party,۝ said Adams. It was a disappointing turn of events, and one that left Adams deeply disillusioned. You have a lot of young passionate people who want to help change the world through Democratic politics,۝ she said. Older Democratic operatives see this passion and exploit it, putting us in an extremely stressful and unhealthy work environment.۝ A member of the Clinton camp, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the national campaign had no involvement in Adams۪ abuser being hired in the other state. The official told HuffPost that it was impossible the campaign would have okayed the hire, given that the abuser was fired for sexual harassment and his name would have surfaced in its job records. Nick Merrill, who had been a spokesman for the campaign, told HuffPost that the allegations in Colorado were met with swift action. Making clear that such incidents will not be tolerated means not only preventing them in the first place, but dealing with them appropriately,۝ Merrill said in a statement. That۪s why, when the matter was brought to the attention of the campaign, the employee who committed that act was immediately terminated.۝ Merrill added that the accused was aware of the potential consequences for his behavior. Every employee on the campaign had to undergo orientation that included sexual harassment training,۝ Merrill said, and that was the case here.۝ In Sanders۪ Campaign In October 2015, Salsbury became president of American University Students for Bernie, a volunteer position. Her main point of contact in the Vermont senator۪s campaign was an intern, another college student in Washington, D.C. When he made unwanted advances toward her, Salsbury said she didn۪t know where to turn because the campaign had no internal infrastructure to deal with such issues ۥ at least involving volunteers. The person Salsbury identified as her harasser did not respond to a request for comment. But her account was confirmed by her friend Colin Moir, a fellow member of the American University group. He had been harassing her sexually,۝ said Moir, adding that Salsbury was not able to speak to somebody higher up and report it.۝ Like Adams, Salsbury felt helpless to stop the harassment. There was no culture of accountability in the D.C. office of the Sanders campaign, she said, and s he didn۪t think people would listen to a young volunteer . It was a culture that didn۪t discuss office policies with volunteers or make it clear that harassment wasn۪t tolerated,۝ said Salsbury. Salsbury did hear from the Sanders campaign after she posted about the incident this month on social media. A former digital media manager reached out to her this past weekend, she said, and on Monday, a Seattle-based lawyer named Bernice Johnson Blessing called her on behalf of the campaign. It firmly felt like the kind of call you make when you۪re trying to feel out if someone has the interest and/or standing to bring a lawsuit,۝ said Salsbury. The conversation with the lawyer made her uncomfortable. It felt like I was being blamed,۝ she said. She suspects that Sanders plans to run for president again in 2020 and they۪re afraid of me being a roadblock to that.۝ Blessing did not return a request for comment. Salsbury۪s account isn۪t the first allegation of a toxic workplace in the Sanders campaign. Earlier this year, as he was running unsuccessfully for Congress in California۪s 34th District, Arturo Carmona battled accusations of sexism and mistreatment of staff from when he was deputy political director in the Sanders campaign. Among the allegations was a charge by the campaign۪s former national Latino outreach strategist, Masha Mendieta, that Carmona had covered up۝ an accusation of sexual harassment made against a volunteer surrogate in Nevada. Carmona didn۪t take the allegations seriously, Mendieta wrote in a Medium post . Arturo and his deputy went out drinking that night, didn۪t pay it another thought, and the next morning assigned two young female interns to the same surrogate we just reported,۝ wrote Mendieta. We objected vehemently and they reassigned them amidst great sighing.۝ Carmona categorically۝ denied the allegations to the Los Angeles Times before the special election. He said, I have always taken issues of harassment and equity in the workplace with the seriousness and sensitivity that they deserve.۝ In a statement to HuffPost,Sen. Sanders was adamant that he does not tolerate sexual harassment۝ in his Senate office or on his campaigns. It is critical we listen to those sharing their stories, recognize no workplace is immune from these problems, and address them in a serious manner,۝he added. Sanders۪ office told HuffPost that while his presidential campaign employees and interns would have been provided with a handbook detailing the process for reporting harassment, volunteers were not given that information. It۪s a policy that they plan to change in the future. I Felt Taken Advantage Of۪ Sexual harassment is a problem in every industry. But it۪s especially hard to fight in the world of presidential campaigns  giant enterprises that spring up in a matter of weeks and are laser-focused on a single goal: electing the candidate. The mental and emotional health of staffers is a secondary consideration, at best. As Adams۪ and Salsbury۪s cases illustrate, even the biggest campaigns have failed to set up and then truly promote the use of reporting structures to deal with harassment allegations. A few people spoke to me within two days of his firing, but then it was never mentioned again,۝ Adams recalled. Despite her treatment,she doesn۪t blame Clinton.Adams still draws comfort from the woman she worked to get elected president. When I criticize the Hillary campaign, I am not criticizing her,۝ said Adams. She was actually a source of inspiration during the hard days.۝ But the entire experience soured her on electoral politics. I felt taken advantage of,۝ she said, and neglected.۝ CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the campaign position of the person for whom Mendieta alleged Carmona had covered up۝ an accusation of sexual harassment. The person was a volunteer surrogate, not a staff member. UPDATE: This article has been updated with comments from a member of the Clinton camp, speaking under the condition of anonymity, and Nick Merrill, who had been a spokesman for Clinton۪s campaign."

Former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio , who called himself America۪s toughest sheriff,۝ was convicted of criminal contempt in July after violating a 2011 court order in a racial profiling case. Arpaio and his office had been ordered not to detain people solely because they thought they might be in the country illegally. Trump pardoned Arpaio , 85, for the contempt charge on Friday. Arpaio۪s tenure as sheriff from 1993 through 2016 has received strong criticism from civil rights advocates, largely stemming from his extreme stance on immigration and for overseeing what they say was cruel treatment of inmates. And few know those controversies better than the Phoenix New Times, an alternative weekly that۪s doggedly covered Arpaio for two decades. The night that Trump pardoned him, the Phoenix New Times unleashed an eye-opening Twitter thread reminding readers of some of the grimmest stories of Arpaio and his office. The numerous tweets  which all link to previous Phoenix New Times stories  describe instances like Arpaio calling his state۪s own jail a concentration camp,۝ jailers breaking the neck of a paraplegic man, the failure of the sheriff۪s office to investigate hundreds of sex abuse cases and a botched SWAT raid in which deputies allegedly laughed as a puppy burned to death. Read the whole thread for yourself below. The Phoenix New Times is not the only paper to come out against Trump۪s decision. In a scathing editorial Friday, the Republic said Trump۪s pardon was insulting. The pardon was a slap to those who worked through the judicial system to make Arpaio accountable, too. It robbed the people hurt by his policies of justice  even before a judge could mete out a sentence. The pardon was a sign of pure contempt for every American who believes in justice, human dignity and the rule of law,۝ the editorial board wrote. By pardoning Arpaio, Trump made it clear that institutional racism is not just OK with him. It is a goal.۝ CORRECTION: Arpaio served as sheriff of Maricopa County from 1993 through 2016, not 2005."
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/george-papadopoulos-big-deal_us_59f72de7e4b077d8dfcb085b","WASHINGTON ۥ There may have been a brief moment Monday morning when the White House thought the week wouldn۪t be so bad. The federal grand jury indictment unsealed against Donald Trump ۪s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort , and his longtime associate Rick Gates, dealt with much of their lobbying work before the 2016 election. At first glance, the indictments didn۪t seem to have much to do with whether Trump and his team coordinated with Russia. They could certainly be used to gain leverage over the former Trump associates, but there was no smoking gun tying the Trump campaign to Russia. But any moment of optimism would have been short-lived. Not long after Manafort and Gates were in federal custody, special counsel Robert Mueller۪s team dropped another bombshell: They۪d flipped a former Trump campaign adviser months ago. The charges against Trump۪s former foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos ۥ a little-known, little-qualified 30-year-old who listed his involvement in Model United Nations as one of his credentials ۥ may end up being a much bigger part of the Russia investigation. The Papadopoulos charges, dated Oct. 5 but only unsealed on Monday, deal directly with his work during the election and his attempt to link up the Russian government with the Trump campaign. His statements also make clear that he was acting with the involvement of higher-ranking officials in Trump۪s orbit. The charges against Papadopoulos became public less than six months after Mueller, a former FBI director, was chosen by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to head up the Russia probe. But Papadopoulos was first arrested on July 27, when he landed at Washington Dulles International Airport on a flight from Germany. And he۪s been cooperating ever since. The public may only now be seeing the first fruits of Mueller۪s investigation, but Papadopoulos has been on the hook for a while. Papadopoulos was charged with lying during an interview with the FBI back in January about his communications with Russians when he served as one of Trump۪s foreign policy advisers. On March 24, 2016, just days after Papadopoulos was publicly identified as one of the Trump campaign۪s foreign policy advisers,he met with a professor in London who had substantial connections۝ to Russian government officials, according to the charges against him. In an interview with FBI agents this year, Papadopoulos claimed that the professor had told him the Russians had dirt۝ on Hillary Clinton before he۪d joined the campaign. But that wasn۪t true: Papadopoulos wasn۪t told about the dirt۝ and thousands of emails۝ that the Russians had on Clinton until more than a month after he joined the campaign. Papadopoulos continued trying to arrange a meeting between the campaign and the Russian government, and he emailed a Senior Policy Advisor۝ on the Trump campaign to tell them he had some interesting messages coming in from Moscow about a trip when the time is right.۝ In one email, a high-ranking campaign official۝ forwarded Papadopoulos۪ email to another campaign official and noted the need to communicate that [Trump] is not doing these trips۝ and that they should send someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal.۝ The timing of when Papadopoulos found out that Russia had thousands of emails۝ on Clinton is particularly noteworthy. Papadopoulos found out the hacked emails existed in April 2016. The leaked emails hacked from Democratic National Committee staffers۪ accounts weren۪t made public until July 2016. And the emails hacked from John Podesta, Clinton۪s campaign chairman, weren۪t released until October. That means a Trump campaign official knew something was coming from the Russian government that would damage the Clinton campaign, months before the public did. In his interview with the FBI, Papadopoulos allegedly tried to downplay his meetings with the professor with ties to Russia, calling him a nothing.۝ In reality, Papadopoulos knew of the professor۪s substantial connections to Russian government officials۝ and used the professor۪s connection to try to connect the campaign with the Russian government. The pending charges against Manafort are still significant because of the leverage they offer Mueller.Manafort, 68, could face a stiff federal prison sentence if convicted, which gives Mueller۪s team serious leverage to convince him to fully cooperate in the probe about the campaign۪s connections to Russia. The White House circulated talking points Monday, asking its GOP allies to stress that Manafort is  not a part of the administration .۝ Conservative media also downplayed the indictment, saying Manafort۪s problematic work was  many years before he joined Trump ۝ and  well before ۝ he joined the campaign. Papadopoulos is also not part of the current administration, but the three indictments together make it tougher for Trump to completely distance himself from the controversy. In the past, the Trump team has tried to write off troubling individuals as peripheral to their operation. While Papadopoulos was a low-level official, he was certainly a part of the campaign. He attended a meeting with Trump and Jeff Sessions, who later became attorney general, in March 2017. There۪s even a photo of them at a table together, with Papadopoulos sitting four places to Trump۪s right and two places to Sessions۪ left. He۪s an energy consultant,۝ Trump told The Washington Post of Papadopoulos in 2016.  Excellent guy .۝ On Monday afternoon, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders downplayed Papadopoulos۪ importance, saying his involvement with the campaign was extremely limited۝ and that he was simply a volunteer.۝ She said that anything Papadopoulos did was not in an official capacity۝ on behalf of the campaign. CORRECTION : A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Jeff Sessions became attorney general in March 2016."

Al Franken (D-Minn.) officially lost the support of many of his colleagues Wednesday, when more than 30 Democratic senators and the chairman of the Democratic National Committee called on him to step down amid multiple sexual misconduct allegations, including groping and kissing women without their consent. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who has been a leader on raising awareness about the epidemic of sexual misconduct, was the first to call on Franken to go. I have been shocked and disappointed to learn over the last few weeks that a colleague I am fond of personally has engaged in behavior towards women that is unacceptable,۝ she said in a Facebook post . I consider Senator Franken to be a friend and have enjoyed working with him in the Senate in our shared fight to help American families. But this moment of reckoning about our friends and colleagues who have been accused of sexual misconduct is necessary, and it is painful. We must not lose sight that this watershed moment is bigger than any one industry, any one party, or any one person.۝ Moments later, several of Gillibrand۪s female colleagues also began calling for Franken۪s resignation. I۪m shocked and appalled by Sen. Franken۪s behavior. It۪s clear to me that this has been a deeply harmful, persistent problem and a clear pattern over a long period of time,۝ Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said in a statement. It۪s time for him to step aside.۝ Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)also called on Franken to resign. An aide said she had spoken to him privately and told him it was the right thing to do. Male senators , including Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) ۥ the caucus۪ No. 2 member ۥ later followed suit. By the end of Wednesday, at least 35 of the 48 senators aligned with the Democrats had called on Franken to resign, according to The New York Times, including almost all of the party۪s female members in the chamber. Fellow Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D) notably did not join her colleagues in calling for Franken۪s resignation, and others have held off as they serve on the Ethics Committee. Senator Klobuchar personally spoke with Senator Franken this morning. As has been reported, he will be making an announcement tomorrow morning,۝ her state director, Ben Hill, said in a statement. Eight women have now come forward with allegations that Franken sexually harassed them over the years. A tipping point for the Democratic senators was a story published Wednesday by Politico , in which a woman said Franken tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of a radio show in 2006. Franken was not yet a senator, and he reportedly told the woman that it was his right as an entertainer۝ to kiss her. For some Democrats,the comment was uncomfortably similar to what Donald Trump said on that famous Access Hollywood۝ tape : You know, I۪m automatically attracted to beautiful  I just start kissing them. It۪s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don۪t even wait. And when you۪re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.۝ There were new allegations today, and enough is enough,۝ Gillibrand said Wednesday at a press conference on Capitol Hill. We need to draw a line in the sand.۝ Democratic women colleagues have been in contact for quite some time regarding the path forward for Sen. Franken,۝ a Senate Democratic aide told HuffPost. Today۪s action was a result of mounting frustrations over the increasing number of accusations.۝ Another Democratic aide added that by last week, there was growing dissatisfaction with Franken within the caucus and frustration that there wasn۪t more happening. The conversations among members picked up Wednesday morning. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called Franken immediately after the Politico story went up and before the avalanche of tweets on Wednesday, according to a personal familiar with the conversation. He told Franken he needed to step down. Schumer reiterated his resignation request later in a meeting at his apartment, with Franken and his wife. On Wednesday afternoon, another woman revealed that Franken had groped her. Tina DuPuy wrote in The Atlantic that the incident occurred when she asked for a photo with him while attending a party for President Barack Obama۪s 2009 inauguration. We posed for the shot. He immediately put his hand on my waist, grabbing a handful of flesh. I froze. Then he squeezed. At least twice,۝ DuPuy wrote. Al Franken۪s familiarity was inappropriate and unwanted. It was also quick; he knew exactly what he was doing.۝ Democrats also said there was increased momentum because the new allegations came on the same day that Time magazine named the Silence Breakers۝ its person of the year , honoring the women who have come forward and spoken out about harassment. And they couldn۪t credibly go after Republicans for supporting Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore ۥ who has been accused of sexual misconduct toward teen girls ۥ without trying to clean out their own house first. Gillibrand stopped short of calling for Democratic leaders to pressure Franken to resign, but said that an ongoing Senate ethics investigation is not equipped۝ to adequately address the situation. I do not feel that he should continue to serve,۝ she said of Franken. Everyone will make their own judgment. I hope they will make their own judgment.۝ Franken۪s office said the senator will make an announcement about his political future on Thursday. Tom Perez , the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, also called on Franken to resign. Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee announced this week that it was jumping back into the Alabama Senate special election and would be giving money to Moore .

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anatoli-samochornov-trump-jr-russia-meeting_us_5966ac00e4b0a8d46d11f69f","WASHINGTON ۥ When President Donald Trump۪s son, son-in-law and campaign chairman met last June with a Russian lawyer they۪d been told had incriminating۝ information from the Russian government about Hillary Clinton, there were other people in the room. One of the previously unidentified attendees was Anatoli Samochornov, a Russian-born American translator who previously spent years working for the U.S. government. Samochornov would not confirm that he was in the room, citing nondisclosure agreements. But The New York Times۪ Ken Vogel said Friday on MSNBC that Samochornov was at the June 9 meeting in Trump Tower. The interpreter۪s mother-in-law also confirmed his attendance at the meeting to The Daily Beast . Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who met with the Trump team, had previously told the Times that an interpreter attended the meeting, but refused to name him. Veselnitskaya does not speak English, and Samochornov has worked with her several times over the past year, including around the time of the meeting with Trump Jr. The Associated Press and NBC News confirmed Friday that Veselnitskaya۪s top U.S. lobbyist, Rinat Akhmetshin , also attended the meeting with her.Akhmetshin is a Russian-American with past ties to Russian intelligence. Samochornov۪s presence at the meeting is key because he appears to be the only witness to the event who does not have close ties to either the Trump campaign or the Russian government. He wouldn۪t tell HuffPost whether he had been contacted by investigators probing the Trump campaign۪s relationship with Russia. The office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller and the House and Senate intelligence committees declined to comment. Samochornov has worked as an interpreter on dozens of government assignments, including for the U.S. State Department, Defense Department, Securities and Exchange Commission and Drug Enforcement Administration, and for a G-8 foreign ministers dinner at the United Nations, according to his resume. He helped facilitate exchange programs for the Meridian International Center, a public diplomacy nonprofit that partners with the State Department between 2001 and 2016, according to the center. He has worked with periodically with the State Department as a contract interpreter for exchange programs. His wife also works for the State Department. Samochornov۪s r̩sum̩ had been posted on his own business website. But the site was taken down after HuffPost contacted him with questions about his work with Veselnitskaya. Freelance interpreter s who work for government agencies often hold a security clearance so they can sit in on sensitive, high-level meetings, said Bradley P. Moss, a lawyer who has represented interpreters with government contracts. Interpreter s with security clearance are in high demand. Doing jobs for a foreign government or a foreign national with ties to a foreign government could make it hard, but not necessarily impossible, to obtain such clearance, Moss noted. A spokesman for the State Department told HuffPost that all interpreters and translators, as a rule,۝ are required to hold at least a Moderate Risk Public Trust clearance. Samochornov has worked on high level [United Nations] and private sector meetings for the Secretary of State and other VIPs,۝ according to his LinkedIn page. He did not respond to a request for comment on whether he holds a security clearance. He has also interpreted for public events on Russian politics. More recently, he volunteered his time to interpret a panel discussion about the Chechen government۪s crackdown on the LGBTQ community. The event was moderated by Russian-born U.S. journalist Masha Gessen, the author of a New Yorker article on the subject. He is the best interpreter in New York, hands down,۝ Gessen said. A registered Democrat, Samochornov works with clients on all sides of American and international politics. But his own views appear to be progressive. On Facebook, he has shared clips from MSNBC host Rachel Maddow۪s show, labeled former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and Bush-era adviser Karl Rove as losers , and posted in favor of expanded health care coverage and more restricted access to guns. When PEN, the literary and human rights organization, invited a gaggle of Russian writers critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin to New York, he became great friends۝ with them, Gessen said. He handles internet trolls on his Facebook page with grace and aplomb. When he posted an image of himself with a French flag overlay, a sign of support for the victims of the November 2015 terror attacks in Paris, a Facebook friend criticized him for not changing his picture to include the Israeli flag after attacks in that country. Samochornov engaged in a lengthy, polite discussion of why he felt personally affected by the Paris attack because of his friends and family who live there. Samochornov has worked for Veselnitskaya since at least April 2016. At that time, she led a lobbying campaign against a U.S. law imposing sanctions on Russia for human rights abuses. The Magnitsky Act was named after Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer and accountant who uncovered corruption in Russia and later died in prison there. Veselnitskaya ran the lobbying effort from the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation, a U.S. nonprofit backed by powerful Russian oligarchs. On April 26, 2016, Samochornov sought credentials for himself and Veselnitskaya from the Open Dialog Foundation to attend a screening of a film critical of Magnitsky at the European Parliament. The next day, Veselnitskaya appeared in Brussels with Samochornov in tow. But the film did not air amid pressure from Bill Browder, a formerly Russian-based hedge fund investor and ex-Magnitsky client who was the driving force behind the sanctions legislation. When HuffPost asked Samochornov about his work for the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation, he said,  I did not have a role at Human Rights Accountability other than offering them interpreting and translation services.۝ Samochornov also translated for Veselnitskaya when she appeared in court in New York earlier this year. The Justice Department had accused Russian businessman Denis Katsyv, one of her clients in Moscow, of laundering the proceeds of a Russian tax fraud scheme through high-end real estate assets in New York City. Veselnitskaya was not licensed to practice law in the U.S., but she assisted Katsyv۪s American legal team. On May 1 and May 11, a lawyer for the American law firm representing Katsyv sent memos to the U.S. district judge requesting equipment for Samochornov to use in providing simultaneous interpretation of court hearings for Veselnitskaya. I۪m a professional freelance interpreter and I can۪t talk about any of my clients,۝ Samochornov told HuffPost. I am bound by confidentiality agreements. You have to refer those questions to Mrs. Veselnitskaya.۝ Later, in an email, he added,  This is my livelihood and I hope you can be sympathetic to the predicament I find myself in.۝ Lydia Polgreen, Ryan J.

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-mccain-donald-trump-senate-health-care_us_5977e2bae4b0a8a40e8399df","WASHINGTON ۥ At his Arizona ranch ۥ a verdant, canyon-bottom spread near Sedona, watered by a river in an otherwise arid, red-rock landscape ۥ John McCain kept a bottle of vodka in the freezer of the fridge. With a fly boy flourish (he was a top gun long before Top Gun۝), he۪d serve a vodka tonic and head to the patio, where he۪d cook skinless chicken on an aircraft-carrier-size grill while listening to the Beach Boys on his boombox. Dinner was a bubbling mix of friends and family, including the McCains۪ adopted Bangladeshi daughter, Bridget, whose dark skin engendered the racist rumors that allies of George W. Bush used to defeat the Arizona senator in the decisive 2000 Republican presidential primary in South Carolina. The Sedona McCain, and the one on the Straight Talk Express bus in the 2000 campaign, was the one the press corps came to adore. He was candid, quotable, approachable, idealistic about ending the corrupting role of money in politics and tamping down mindless ideological rigidity. He was a Reagan Republican but one who had seen war, had suffered in a Vietnamese prison for years and who emerged humane and whole. I wish I could say that it was this McCain that I saw from my perch in the Senate Press Gallery on Tuesday. But, sadly, I saw someone else: yet another victim of President Donald Trump ۪s rampage through Constitutional democracy. Pale and wan from the ravages of brain cancer, McCain did his best to speak passionately about the desperate need to restore at least a measure of bipartisanship, of good will, of respect for institutions, for the Constitution, for the Founders and for the calming and consensus-building role of the U.S Senate, in which the Arizonan has served for 30 years. He drew applause and hugs. But the moment did not hold. For one, McCain spoke after giving Trump a crucial victory, the legislative license to begin dismantling Obamacare with no real idea of what would replace it. Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ۪s strategy for Trump was to get on the bill۝ and only then decide what the bill might look like, with no chance ۥ for arcane procedural reasons ۥ to slow it by filibuster. That is hardly the way the Senate is supposed to work, and McCain and everyone in the chamber knew it. Nor was the irony lost on anyone that McCain was receiving the best possible treatment at taxpayer expense and that he had flown to Washington to help enable a piece of legislation that would, in one way or another, reduce the health care coverage available to millions of Americans. The speech didn۪t resonate for another reason. He delivered it as a gust amid the Trump storm that is rampaging through the institutions and traditions the senator was extolling in his eloquent speech. Consider the Trump assault: The fake media. Press briefings are a joke. Regular order۝ in Congress barely exists. The president insults and bullies his attorney general. Trump۪s allies talk of firing special counsel Robert Mueller, appointed by the Justice Department to investigate possible Trump ties to the Russians. The president talks trash to the Boy Scouts. He talks trash about anyone he thinks threatens him. McCain was just the latest to get run over. He is no saint, as McCain himself would ruefully admit. By the time he ran and won the presidential nomination in 2008, he۪d become a harder man. He did what his advisers told him, and he took as his vice presidential running mate the utterly unqualified governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. Then he sent his minions out to trash the press for objecting to the choice. But I would rather talk about the McCain at a rowdy Minnesota rally in 2008, when a woman in the crowd told him she feared candidate Barack Obama because he was an Arab and a Muslim. Obama was neither, McCain said. I have to tell you. Sen. Obama is a decent person and a person you don۪t have to be scared of as president of the United States,۝ McCain said. He۪s a decent family man [and] citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues, and that۪s what this campaign۪s all about.۝ That McCain was obliterated Tuesday. I now see him for what, sadly, he is: a Republican comfort station on the road to perdition."
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-george-papadopoulos_us_59f86a2ee4b0aec1467aa951","WASHINGTON ۥ President Donald Trump on Tuesday downplayed the role of his former foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, calling him merely a young, low level volunteer,۝ whom he claimed few people knew.۝ The president۪s Tuesday morning tweets were his first comments about Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about being offered dirt۝ from the Russian government regarding Trump۪s 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton, according to a federal indictment unsealed Monday. Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar,۝ Trump tweeted. Papadopoulos served on Trump۪s foreign policy advisory council during his campaign, a group led by then-Trump adviser Jeff Sessions, who is now attorney general. When announcing the team in March of 2016, Trump praised him as an excellent guy.۝ The discovery that Papadopoulos had actively tried to obtain information from Russian officials came as special counsel Robert Mueller۪s investigation into possible collusion between Trump۪s campaign and Russian officials during last year۪s election made its biggest moves yet. In addition to Papadopoulos, who is now cooperating with the investigation, Mueller۪s team also indicted Trump۪s former campaign manager Paul Manafort . White House officials and Trump allies have swiftly sought to distance the president from the revelations by minimizing the campaign officials۪ involvement in Trump۪s campaign: a familiar  and at times, absurd  line of defense . On Tuesday, former Trump campaign adviser Michael Caputo told CNN that Papadopoulos was just a coffee boy۝ for the campaign . When asked about a photograph showing Papadopoulos at a meeting with Trump and Sessions, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Monday dismissed it, saying that the president has thousands of photographs with millions of people.۝ Of Manafort, who was Trump۪s campaign chairman, Sanders said he was brought in to lead the delegate process, which he did, and was dismissed not too long after that۝  omitting the time that he spent leading Trump۪s campaign. Trump on Tuesday reiterated that Manafort۪s indictment vindicated him because the conspiracy and money laundering charges against Manafort took place long before he came to the campaign.۝ However, the indictment, which details how Manafort concealed profits from lobbying for pro-Russia groups , covers activities up to and including this year. Trump again insisted that Manafort۪s charges indicate no collusion,۝ citing Manafort۪s lawyer. He also attacked the fake news۝ and called for an investigation into Democrats. In a subsequent tweet, Trump attempted to divert attention from Monday۪s revelations by focusing on congressional Republicans۪push to pass tax legislation by the end of the year. Trump seethed at Monday۪s news, according to The Washington Post , fuming۝ and expressing exasperation and disgust۝ while watching television reports about the indictments. In more tweets on Tuesday, Trump attempted to change the conversation to what he called the biggest story yesterday,۝ Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta leaving his firm after it was implicated in Manafort۪s indictment , which Trump-friendly Fox News emphasized in its coverage of the story. Podesta۪s brother is former Clinton campaign manager John Podesta. This story has been updated with additional tweets from Trump."
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-no-longer-conservative-party_us_59767dd6e4b0e201d5776f8c","To most Americans,  conservative ۝ is interchangeable with  Republican Party .۝ After all, the GOP has usually been the more conservative side of a two-party system for a century. We also tend to understand who a conservative is based on the root of the word: someone who is cautious and respects the status quo, or, put more strongly, someone who is resistant to change. But the term has philosophical roots, too, separate from the party. Political parties are fundraising organizations attached to a policy platform. Over time, platforms change. The Republican Party has been around more than 160 years and has changed directions many times, as has the Democratic Party . At its founding, the GOP was abolitionist (a radical position at the time), pro-Union (that is, for big۝ government over states۪ rights) and for the expansion of individual rights. The GOP became firmly conservative only in the 20th century. From a European perspective, however, both U.S. parties have been conservative since World War II (that is, both are on the right end of the spectrum of most modern parliamentary democracies), and at the same time, both parties have always been liberal, as inheritors of Enlightenment notions of citizens۪ rights, individual liberty and representative government. But gradual shifts in the GOP over the last two or three decades that culminated in Donald Trump ۪s election in 2016 have changed all that. The GOP is no longer a conservative party in any meaningful way. It is instead something else, and it needs a more accurate description. Why should we care what European political philosophy has to say about U.S. politics? Because our politics arose out of that philosophy, and going back to those roots brings clarity. Most knowledgeable philosophical conservatives today will tell you how unhappy they are with how far the Republican Party has drifted. Some prominent conservatives leaned toward Democrats in the 2000s, such as Catholic conservative commentator Andrew Sullivan , and more have become never-Trumpers, including former Republican strategist Ana Navarro . This is because the GOP of Trump, House leader Paul Ryan and Senate leader Mitch McConnell has become a radical right. That may sound like a contradiction, since radical۝ is usually shorthand for the far left, but the seeming contradiction demonstrates how restrictive our notion of the right-left political spectrum really is, and that۪s perhaps the most important thing we can learn from looking to our European roots. The Battle Between Reason And Unreason The best way to understand these roots is a historical survey of the long 19th century۝ (from the French Revolution to World War I) and the short 20th century۝ (encompassing both world wars and the Cold War), descriptions coined by historian Eric Hobsbawm . When I teach this period, I frame it somewhat facetiously as an epic battle between reason and unreason.۝ In other words, the Enlightenment posed a question to Europe: What happens if we use reason (over tradition or religion) to govern ourselves? Of course, the debate was rarely that stark. Few rationalists were purely so, while proponents of the old ways pointed out how much rationality there was in tradition. Rather, I try to show students how modern European history has been a struggle between these impulses within movements as well as in opposition to each other. The French Revolution can be seen as a rousing crescendo in the symphony of support for the rationalization of government and society in Europe. It established the notion of rights, individual liberties and the primacy of the secular state. From there we can draw a line to today۪s liberal democracies. Both major U.S. parties and most of postwar Western politics have been in this tradition until very recently. But the two centuries following the French Revolution were filled with jockeying over people۪s reactions to the cataclysmic event, from reactionaries۝ who wanted to turn back the clock to centrists who wanted to keep things as defined in the revolution۪s early stage to Jacobins, the leftist radicals who wanted to push rights still further by any means necessary. This is where our right-left spectrum comes from: three broad categories of responses to the French Revolution. Most of modern Western politics is descended from the center-left responses that accepted rights as natural۝ and argued only about who was included, the best ways to translate political rights into liberties and to what degree. On this spectrum, any conservatism۝ within a democracy is already a centrist position because it accepts rights and representation, though in a more limited way. The far-right position in the 19th century was known as Reaction .۝ Reactionary religious philosophers like Joseph de Maistre prioritized God۪s law over man۪s, arguably leaning toward theocracy. Reactionary statesmen like Klemens von Metternich primarily wanted to save or return to traditional power structures and were in this sense conservative,۝ though their violent attempts to put down any perceived threat could be described as more paranoid than cautious. Konstantin Pobedonostsev  a statesman and tutor of the future Alexander III, Russia۪s most reactionary tsar  made strong rational criticisms of democracy. He warned that representative government diluted power and that the press  not the people or their representatives, who have little say in what writers and editors do  had the power to make or break a democratic society. (Some members of America۪s alt-right profess allegiance toward Reaction , though it can be hard to tell when they are sincere and when they are praising autocracy for the shock value.) As monarchies increasingly failed to stem the tide of Enlightenment secularism, Irish statesman Edmund Burke took de Maistre۪s place as a figurehead for mainstream conservative philosophy. Coming from the British tradition, he accepted rights and representation but wanted them limited to a (wealthy white male) few. This was an easier position to accept in a monarchy that was already limited and had inherited the liberal philosophy of John Locke. Burke was appalled by the vulgarity۝ of the French Revolution and yet supported American independence. Though Burke۪s name is most strongly associated with conservatism to this day, he was a contradictory figure who does not best exemplify the post-Revolution conservatism that dominated propertied classes in Europe and North America in the 19th century. Most mainstream conservatives were ordinary people who enjoyed some wealth and social position, and didn۪t question the systems they were born into. Their priority was to protect what they had. Take the example of Russian provincial nobleman Andrei Chikhachev , who inherited serfs but recognized it as a system that couldn۪t last. He worshiped knowledge, working to expand education for serfs, and he welcomed technological advances so long as they were introduced cautiously. Rather than fearing revolution like a reactionary, he pitied decadent, urbanized Westerners from a place of complacency with his own more orderly (and unequal) rural idyll. If Chikhachev had been born in Boston instead of rural Russia, he probably would have accepted representative government as unquestioningly as he did monarchy, because it was there. He could have been just as pious, just as cautious, just as uncritically patriotic in either system, as indeed most propertied white men were then, whether they lived in a rising democracy or a failing autocracy. The right wing, in other words, is not one thing. As it has changed over time, it has also varied greatly in degree and emphasis, and in context. There are multiple philosophical sources that inform different streams of thought, many of which end up in surprising places. There is a clear continuity from even the most liberal conservatives to extreme reactionaries ( as American political theorist Corey Robin stresses ), but there is also a meaningful difference between acceptance of representative government and social change (even if regretfully, cynically or pragmatically) and violent, organized opposition to either. The Right And the Radical What can it mean to be both right۝ (resistant to change) and radical۝ (pursuing extreme change)? One answer has to do with nationalism. Civic nationalism۝ is a liberal compromise that ties voting and citizenship to the nation and state order, as in the modern U.S. or Britain. Ethnic nationalism,۝ in contrast, offers as natural and timeless something that was constructed in the middle of the 19th century. To build a tribal identity around ethnicity, language, history and religion  and use that identity to justify a state (as opposed to a monarchy justified by God)  was new . Germany is a tragic example of ethnic nationalism run amok. As foreign minister of Prussia in the mid-19th century, Otto von Bismarck added the element of nationalism to the drive for power he inherited from Metternich. Bismarck asserted that German speakers, then spread across principalities and empires, should be united into one German state. He achieved the unification of what we know as Germany in 1871, then acquired overseas colonies and helped perpetuate an arms race with Britain, leading to World War I. The militarization of Germany۪s government in this period, along with colonial atrocities, such as the Herero genocide ,chillingly presaged the Holocaust before ever Adolf Hitler was rejected from art college. Nationalism took its strong and ugly grip on Europe during a period of industrialization, expansion of middle classes and the entrenchment of large, bureaucratic governments that consolidated the principles of the French Revolution despite reactionary challenges (the long 19 th century۝). Property-owning men increasingly wielded power and accumulated wealth through professions, business and government more than inheritance. But working classes and minorities saw their conditions deteriorate with few gains in political representation. Socialism, developing in response to industrialization, recognized that the liberal focus on rights and the free market was liberating only for some. This led to the idea that only economic equality could bring real liberty ۥ an idea that terrified the haves and intrigued the have-nots. Nationalism emerged as a story that could unite whole populations regardless of vast disparities in wealth. And by defining us,۝ nationalism also defines who is the other,۝ providing someone to blame who is coincidentally not the people enjoying power and wealth. A system that was threatened by the poor and minorities told the poor to hate minorities, leaving minorities to fear the poor. Nationalism called to our irrational impulses to assuage wrongs brought by (rational) technology and economics. By the 20th century, technocratic, largely secular nationalists used both pseudo-science and appeals to tradition to promote a genocidal agenda to aggrandize their own tribe (Nazism was one variant of fascism). Other fascists in Romania, Croatia, Portugal and elsewhere were explicitly religious and allied themselves wholly with the counter-Enlightenment, harnessing fears of change and difference to unite their nations. These political religions۝ are another subtle variation on theocracy. Where liberal democracy focuses on equal rights and opportunities for individuals to do what they want, short of imposing on others۪ rights, socialism focuses on harnessing the productivity of all for the benefit of all, a collectivist perspective. Nationalism is also inherently collectivist because the nation is held above its component parts: the people. The core idea all fascists had in common was the supremacy of the nation over the lives or liberty of its citizens, as well as their nation۪s superiority over others. The Nazi use of socialist۝ in the full form of its party name, National Socialists, implied this collectivism but, by adding national,۝ rejected everything else about socialism that made it socialism: its aim of economic equality without regard to divisions by ethnicity or religion. This appealed to voters who might have been tempted by the economic promise of socialism but recoiled from its rejection of their identity and traditional values. Fascism And The Right-Wing Fringe So, was fascism conservative? It had its roots in right-wing movements and appealed to counter-Enlightenment, reactionary values, albeit with a veneer of scientific-sounding rhetoric. It violently opposed both liberal democracy and socialism and strongly favored social hierarchy (inequality defined by race). But fascism was also radical because it embraced a strong bureaucratic government rather than inheritance as the basis for power and embraced technological progress (for its military and economic advantages). Therefore, it was not reactionary, unless we use that term so loosely it no longer defines the people it was coined to describe. But fascism also cannot be called conservative۝ without losing that term۪s original meaning, since it sought drastic changes by means so vulgar۝ as to be unimaginable to conservatives like Burke. So fascism was both right-wing and radical. In other words, the left versus right۝ terms we use to describe our politics (and the political compass variation on it) fail to take into account one of the most important political debates of the 20th century: individualism versus collectivism, with nationalism as the key concept within that debate. Those of us born to the Anglo-American tradition often miss this because our experience is of the seemingly easy compromise position of civic nationalism. But 2016 has forced Americans to pay attention to virulent nationalism and everything that goes with it. America has always had a resentful, white-supremacist nationalism based on hating the other۝ and rejecting liberalism. What changed in 2016 is that a major party embraced this fringe, handed it power and is now refusing to check that power with anything more than a furrowed brow. Whether motivated by cynicism, greed, fear, delusion, helplessness or true belief, by its inaction the Republican Party has abandoned the last vestiges of a conservatism that is skeptical of change, values individual liberty and accepts the premise of representative government. This Republican Party is a radical right containing elements of theocracy (Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and the evangelical base ) and fascism (the extreme alt-right, who remain unrenounced by the president and who are represented in the White House by Chief Strategist Steve Bannon ). Clearly the old schemas ۥ always imperfect ۥ cannot capture the tectonic shift in American politics institutionalized by Trump۪s election. They are products of the Industrial Age, and so one way to begin mapping our new landscape is to consider how the current information revolution should be central to our understanding of today۪s politics. We could start by appropriating the name Know-Nothings۝ for the modern Republican Party, since it۪s characterized by its denial of reality (the original Know-Nothings, who took their name from their secrecy, were anti-immigrant nativists). This term highlights a peculiarly postmodern twist this radical right has put on the big lie۝ propaganda that Hitler famously recommended. Alternative facts۝ don۪t just offer an unsubstantiated, and often absurd, narrative; they destabilize the idea that truth exists or matters. Political lying is nothing new, and even lying on this scale has precedents (though only in the worst regimes). Today۪s right goes a step further to undermine the value of any knowledge, education or evidence, for a receptive audience that cares only whether the script plays to their team۪s advantage or serves as a strike against the other team. An Anti-Government Government Liberals and conservatives , in the proper sense of those words, are now both uncomfortably covered by the shade of the never-Trump tent. Both accept the premise of rights and representative government, and watch in horror as norms are flouted daily. A party that used to represent limited government encroachment on individual lives moved ۥ through a religiously motivated drive to control women۪s bodies ۥ into a new present, where the president, Cabinet and Congress explicitly oppose the government they run in every respect but their personal domination of it. Their voting base ۥ largely white and evangelical ۥ cheer the undermining of democracy through voting restrictions and boo defenses of traditional American values, such as freedom of the press, separation of church and state, the right to protest, and checks and balances. These elected officials and their base voters are not conservatives in any sense that doesn۪t warp the term beyond recognition. They are a radical right that recalls earlier radical right movements such as reactionaries, fascists and theocrats. But they are also a new phenomenon. They were elevated to power through hacking, bots, gerrymandering, voter suppression and PACs. The information revolution made it possible for the least knowledgeable and yet most extreme to push themselves to power to dismantle government from within, despite losing the popular vote and continuing strong popular opposition. We will need new words to describe this, as it continues to develop in unpredictable ways. But one thing is sure: The familiar days of the right۝ as cautious men in suits and the left۝ as hairy hippies are over. The Cold War, with its comforting clich̩s about authoritarianism happening to other people, is over. We۪re living something else now. ۥۥ Katherine Pickering Antonova is an associate professor of history at Queens College, City University of New York, and author of An Ordinary Marriage: The World of a Gentry Family in Provincial Russia and A Consumer۪s Guide to Information: How to Avoid Losing Your Mind on the Internet ."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-parliamentarian-byrd-rule-health-care_us_59727d12e4b00e4363df9867","WASHINGTON Efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act ran into big trouble on Friday afternoon, when the Senate parliamentarian ruled that nearly a dozen key provisions of GOP repeal legislation violate special procedural rules that Republicans are using to pass their bill. The list of provisions includes a clause, which many conservatives consider essential, that would defund Planned Parenthood and block federal money from helping to pay for insurance policies that cover abortion. Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough also ruled out a six-month lockout۝ period for people trying to buy insurance after they have let it lapse ۥ a key policy feature of the Senate bill that insurers say is vital to keeping markets stable. In the ruling, a summary of which the office of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) posted, the parliamentarian۪s office indicated that it would still be reviewing other parts of the Senate proposal ۥ including provisions that would allow insurers more flexibility to vary premiums by age or to offer plans that leave out benefits such as mental health and maternity care that current law considers essential. And the parliamentarian hasn۪t even had a chance to consider a new amendment, proposed by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), that would allow insurers to offer some plans not subject to rules guaranteeing coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. Politically, the biggest blow for Republicans is the ruling that a provision prohibiting funds from being used to purchase insurance policies that cover abortion. That rider was key to House conservatives accepting their version of the legislation, and Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows suggested that, without that prohibition, the bill could not pass the House on the way back from the Senate. The elimination of the Planned Parenthood [funding prohibition] is very puzzling since it passed the parliamentarian۪s scrutiny in the past,۝ Meadows told HuffPost Friday afternoon, but today۪s ruling as it relates to the life issue will make passage almost impossible.۝ The ruling matters because Republicans are trying to pass legislation through the budget reconciliation process, a special procedure in which measures are not subject to a filibuster in the Senate. That makes it possible to pass a bill with just 50 senators rather than 60, with the vice president breaking the tie ۥ something essential for Republicans, because they have only 52 seats and are not trying to pass their bill with Democratic support. But if reconciliation makes it possible to pass a bill with fewer votes, it also imposes strict rules on what a bill may include. Legislation must have a significant economic impact and cannot merely change policy ۥ otherwise it is subject to 60 votes. (This is called the Byrd Rule,۝ named after former Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia.) The parliamentarian is the one who interprets rules. If the parliamentarian decides a provision does not conform to the guidelines for reconciliation, Democrats can (and surely would) demand that the provisions be subject to normal voting procedures ۥ in other words, subject to a filibuster that would require 60 votes to overcome. The parliamentarian۪s decision today proves once again that the process Republicans have undertaken to repeal the Affordable Care Act and throw 22 million Americans off of health insurance is a disaster,۝ said Sanders, who is ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee. The parliamentarian۪s ruling is not the end of the story.Republicans could modify language in their bill, in the hope that with some small tweaks it would pass muster. Or they could decide to vote on legislation other than the Better Care Reconciliation Act, which is the bill GOP leaders submitted for consideration. Additionally,the parliamentarian isn۪t the final arbiter of what the Senate may consider in reconciliation. It۪s the presiding officer, who in this case would likely be Vice President Mike Pence. The presiding officer could simply ignore the parliamentarian۪s guidance ۥ a move that conservatives like Cruz have suggested Republicans consider, even though it would flout Senate traditions and other Republicans have hinted they would not support it."

Clarke, who resigned as sheriff in August, made the threat in a tweet Saturday following stories about the affidavit that was unsealed on Thursday. He also warned libs۝ to bring a hard hat۝ because I۪m going to smack you around.۝ The affidavit said that last January, Clarke texted his deputies to detain Dan Black after the plane they were on landed in Milwaukee. Black had shaken his head after he recognized Clarke and they had a brief conversation, and Clarke took it as a slight. Just a field interview, no arrest unless he becomes an asshole with your guys,۝ Clarke texted a deputy, according to a screenshot obtained by the FBI.ʉQuestion for him is why he said anything to me. Why didn۪t he just keep his mouth shut? ۝ After Black exited the plane he was met by six deputies and two police dogs, questioned, and escorted out of the airport, according to the affidavit. The affidavit was originally filed in March to obtain a search warrant to access Clarke۪s emails. An investigation of the incident by the Audit Services Division of the Milwaukee County controller۪s office determined that Clarke had used his official position as sheriff of Milwaukee County in excess of his lawful authority to direct his deputies to stop and question Black without legal justification,۝ the affidavit stated. Still, federal prosecutors informed Clarke۪s attorney in May that they weren۪t going to pursue charges against him over the incident. On Saturday, Clarke lashed out in several tweets aboutʉlibs,۝ lib media۝ and fake news۝ following the stories about the affidavit. The tasting blood۝ tweet included a photoshopped image of Trump holding a wrestler labeled CNN۝ who was being kicked in the face by a smiling, photoshopped Clarke. When LYING LIB MEDIA makes up FAKE NEWS to smear me, the ANTIDOTE is go right at them,۝ Clarke tweeted. Punch them in the nose & MAKE THEM TASTE THEIR OWN BLOOD.۝ He later tweeted: Nothing like getting under the skin of lefties like I did today.۝ He warned libs۝ toʉbring a hard hat,۝ because I۪m going to smack you around until you crawl back to your mom۪s basement.۝ Clarke posted a note apparently from Twitter saying that it had received complaints about the tasting blood۝ tweet, but that it could not identify any violations of the Twitter rules.۝ Clarke tweeted: Twitter says no violation. Duh.۝ Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the note posted by Clarke or whether it was legitimate. One of the Twitter rules is: You may not make specific threats of violence or wish for the serious physical harm, death, or disease of an individual or group of people.۝ Clarke complained in an earlier tweet that the affidavit was old news and that the Justice Department had informed his lawyer thatʉthere was no evidence of wrongdoing for doing police work.۝ In fact, the letter said that a decision had been made not to criminally prosecute any civil rights offenses۝ against Clarke usingʉthe only federal statute likely available to us۝ because of concerns that such a case would be difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.۝ The letter warns, however, that the decision could change if additional information came to light.۝ The FBI sought access to Clarke۪s emails because agents believed he either personally attacked Black in posts on the Milwaukee County Sheriff Facebook page, or encouraged his staff to do so, according to the affidavit. A civil rights lawsuit by Black is still pending against Clarke. Clarke, who spoke at the Republican National Convention in July 2016, infamously encouraged Trump supporters to take up  pitchforks and torches ۝ shortly before the 2016 presidential election because the system was rigged۝ against the GOP nominee. He has also called members of the Black Lives Matter movement creeps.۝ In June he said he turned down a job offer from the Trump administration to be assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-no-empathy_us_59e76efce4b0d0e4fe6c8d2d","It was almost too easy to predict what would happen. A president who is infamous for his inability to show empathy tries to convince the media he is the most caring president ever. And it completely backfires. President Donald Trump had been silent for more than a week about the deaths of four U.S. soldiers in Niger, in what was the deadliest combat operation during his time in office. So it wasn۪t surprising when a reporter questioned him during his Monday press conference about this topic. Why haven۪t we heard anything from you so far about the soldiers that were killed in Niger? And what do you have to say about that?۝ the reporter asked. Trump could have used the moment to talk about the fallen service members. But instead, as he often does, he made it about himself. He tried to brag about how compassionate and considerate he is. I۪ve written them personal letters.... I will, at some point during the period of time, call the parents and the families ۥ because I have done that, traditionally. ... So, the traditional way ۥ if you look at President Obama and other presidents, most of them didn۪t make calls, a lot of them didn۪t make calls. I like to call when it۪s appropriate, when I think I۪m able to do it,۝ Trump said. Aides to previous presidents hit back on Trump۪s claim, noting he is not the first president to call fallen service members۪ families. Trump, feeling defensive, brought up his chief of staff John Kelly۪s son ۥ who died serving in Afghanistan ۥ to make a political point: He noted that Obama did not call Kelly when his son died in 2010. It۪s not clear whether Kelly agreed to the politicization of his son. But in the past, he has been reluctant to talk about him and has asked that his death not be brought up . Several Obama advisers were shocked that Trump stooped to that level, and even the White House seemed uneasy with the whole thing; officials would confirm that Kelly never received a call from Obama, but they only agreed to do so anonymously. The day after the press conference, Trump finally called the families of the service members killed in Niger. That move could have put the controversy to rest. But instead, it made Trump look even more insensitive . Trump reportedly told Myeshia Johnson, the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, that her husband  knew what he signed up for .۝ Those comments were relayed by Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.), who is close to the family and was in the car when Trump called Johnson. Trump tweeted Wednesday morning that Wilson was lying and said he had some sort of proof.۝ But later Wednesday,La David Johnson۪s mother, Cowanda Jones-Johnson, confirmed that the president had shown disrespect۝ to her family . White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders created doubt that any proof of Trump۪s statement would ever turn up, when she told reporters Wednesday afternoon that there was no recording made of the phone call. Sanders said it was a disgrace۝ for the media to characterize Trump۪s act of kindness۝ as an act of callousness, and she went after Wilson for speaking out. She refused, however, to say whether Trump had used the words Wilson claimed he said. The president۪s call, as accounted by multiple people in the room, believe that the president was completely respectful, very sympathetic, and expressed the condolences of himself and the rest of the country, and thanked the family for their service, commended them for having an American hero in their family, and I don۪t know how you can take that any other way,۝ she said. A reporter also asked her whether Kelly signed off on Trump۪s political use of his son۪s death; Sanders said she was unsure۝ if he did. In a statement Wednesday, Wilson said she stood firmly۝ by her account of Trump۪s call. This is personal for me, not political,۝ she said. Sgt. Johnson was a member of my community and of the 5000 Role Models of Excellence Project that I founded to help boys of color build successful futures. ... The loved ones Sgt. Johnson leaves behind are my constituents and my job now is to do all that I can to help them heal. I۪ll save the bully pulpit for the necessary task of uncovering the circumstances surrounding the ambush and working to help ensure that our soldiers have all of the resources and support that they need while putting their lives on the line to keep others safe.۝ Later Wednesday, the news kept getting worse for Trump. Chris Baldridge, the father of Army Cpl. Dillon Baldridge, told The Washington Post that the president called him when he lost his son in June. Trump promised to send him $25,000 and set up an online fundraiser for the family, Baldridge said, but he never followed through. Presidents have traditionally acted as comforters-in-chief, both to the nation and on an individual level. President Ronald Reagan was particularly known for his speeches to a grieving public, and President Barack Obama delivered a moving eulogy in Charleston after a white supremacist killed black churchgoers there. At the personal level, President Abraham Lincoln famously wrote a letter to a widow, Mrs. Bixby, expressing his sympathies: I have been shown in the files of the War Department a statement of the Adjutant General of Massachusetts, that you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle. I feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the Republic they died to save. I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours, to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of Freedom. Trump has not had any such moment. When he traveled to Texas to address the Hurricane Harvey response, he spoke at length about what a great job he and his team were doing. And when he went to Puerto Rico, he told one family of hurricane survivors:  Have a good time .۝ Want more updates from Amanda Terkel? Sign up for her newsletter, Piping Hot Truth, here ."
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-birth-control_us_59a8adb6e4b0b5e530fd735f","NEW YORK ۥ President Donald Trump۪s administration issued a new rule Friday that allows all employers to opt out of including birth control in their health insurance plans for any moral or religious reason, rolling back the Obama-era requirement that guaranteed contraception coverage at no cost to 62 million women. Requiring insurance plans to cover birth control imposes a substantial burden۝ to the free exercise of religion guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution, and could promote risky sexual behavior۝ among adolescents, the administration told reporters Thursday night. The Affordable Care Act deemed contraception an essential part of women۪s preventive health care for the first time in history, requiring that it be covered under most insurance plans, along with prenatal care, breast exams and well-woman visits. The birth control mandate compelled for-profit employers to cover the full range of contraceptives, including the pill, the intrauterine device and the Plan B morning-after pill, at no out-of-pocket cost to women, while carving out exemptions for churches and nonprofit religious organizations. The Trump administration, which is stacked with officials who oppose contraception ,will now allow any employer or for-profit company,regardless of whether they are religious, to refuse to include the coverage in their health insurance plans for moral reasons. This could mean that tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of women in the United States will once again have to pay out of pocket for birth control. I think what the Trump administration is trying to do is effectively gut the rule without repealing it, because repealing it would be so unpopular,۝ said Gretchen Borchelt, vice president for reproductive rights and health at the National Women۪s Law Center. They۪re taking contraception coverage away from women without justification.۝ Women۪s health groups have argued that the policy, crafted and supported by anti-abortion activists, will have the opposite of its intended effect. Before the law took effect in 2012, one in three women struggled to afford her birth control prescription each month, which can cost up to $50 a pack for the pill and much more for long-acting methods like the IUD. And more than 20 percent of women of childbearing age had to pay for contraception out of pocket. The preventive health benefit saved women $1.4 billion on birth control in the first year it went into effect, which has contributed to an all-time low in unintended pregnancy and the lowest U.S. abortion rate since the procedure became legal in 1973. If you truly want to reduce the need for abortion,۝ Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Dana Singiser told reporters on Thursday, invest in women۪s health and preventative care.۝ Many religious conservatives who oppose birth control coverage believe some forms of contraception, including the IUD and the morning-after pill, are akin to abortion.According to a report by the left-leaning think tank the Center for American Progress, 45 companies have applied for exemptions to the birth control rule, more than half of which are for-profit companies. Trump۪s much broader loophole would allow any boss to object to the coverage. The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a legal advocacy group that has fought the contraception mandate in court on behalf of nonprofits, praised Trump۪s new workaround. We believe that people with sincere religious beliefs should be able to use an exemption,۝ said Lori Windham, an attorney with the group. It۪s a good way to protect those Americans who want to be able to provide quality health insurance, but can۪t in good conscience provide contraceptives.۝ Several progressive legal groups, including the National Women۪s Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union, have indicated that they will challenge the move. The Supreme Court told the Obama administration in April 2016 that it must find a way to accommodate religious employers while also guaranteeing that women continue to receive full and equal contraception coverage,regardless of where they work. Trump۪s rule does nothing to guarantee women seamless coverage. The groups could also challenge the new regulation on the grounds that it discriminates against women by singling out a women۪s health benefit. It violates equal protection laws if they are treating women differently,۝ said Borchelt. We۪re outlining a number of potential legal claims, and we have some really good, strong complaints.۝"

Must quash Russia investigation into president of the United States. Also, must go after leakers. Willingness to endure criminal prosecution for obstruction of justice a plus.۝ Lost amid the never-ending palace intrigues of the West Wing remains this extraordinary desire of President Donald Trump: An attorney general who will end special counsel Robert Mueller۪s probe of possible collusion between Russian intelligence and the Trump presidential campaign. In statements on Twitter, in interviews and publicly at a news conference , Trump has been insulting Attorney General Jeff Sessions for more than a week for recusing himself from the Russia investigation back in March. If Jeff Sessions didn۪t recuse himself, we wouldn۪t even be talking about this subject,۝ Trump told The Wall Street Journal. That, said the former top ethics lawyer in President George W. Bush۪s White House, speaks volumes, particularly in light of Trump۪s firing of FBI Director James Comey in May. It۪s not about Comey. It۪s not about Mueller. It۪s about the Russia probe,۝ said Richard Painter, now a law professor at the University of Minnesota. Trump۪s White House did not respond to queries on the matter, and Sessions  the first sitting senator to endorse Trump۪s campaign last year  has given no indication he intends to leave his job on his own. Painter said that shows good judgment on Sessions۪ part, as does his refusal to fire Mueller. I don۪t think Sessions is going to do it because I don۪t think he wants to be charged with obstruction of justice,۝ Painter said. There is no reason to fire Mueller other than to stop the Russia investigation.۝ Randy Evans, a Republican National Committee member from Georgia, defended Trump, saying his criticisms of Sessions do not constitute obstruction of justice  just a president who would have preferred an attorney general who could have kept a distraction under control. He is a very hands-on leader,۝ Evans said, adding that Trump is a president who thinks out loud۝ and is more interested in results than methods. Trump is clearly upset with Sessions, but his public attacks are more akin to a college football coach trying to get better performance from a quarterback than trying to get someone to quit, Evans said. When there۪s a lack of winning, he۪s not going to be shy in letting you know about it.۝ Other Republicans said Trump۪s actions are indefensible, and show how his aberrant behavior has normalized what previously had been unimaginable. Florida GOP consultant Rick Wilson, who worked in the George H.W. Bush White House, said a staffer who recommended firing the attorney general to block an investigation into that president would have been out of a job. That person would have been fired. They would have been shown the door instantaneously. They would have been out in a hot minute,۝ Wilson said. Now, it۪s so much the new normal that everyone just shrugs, and says, Sure. Of course he۪s trying to obstruct justice.۪۝ Rick Tyler, a Republican strategist who worked for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the GOP presidential primaries, said that if Trump is unhappy with Sessions, he should tell him so privately, not in media interviews and on Twitter. That should all be internal. It should not be external,۝ Tyler said. Trump۪s outbursts are causing harm to himself  Comey۪s firing, for example, led to the appointment of Mueller, Tyler noted. We have Mueller because of Trump, and for no other reason,۝ Tyler said. He۪s his own worst enemy.۝ Sessions recused himself from the ongoing investigation into Russian interference after his own undisclosed meetings with Russian officials came to light. That left the probe under the charge of Sessions۪ deputy, Rod Rosenstein. Two months later, Trump fired Comey after the FBI director refused to drop a related investigation into Trump۪s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, for his undisclosed Russia contacts. The very next day, Trump told the Russian foreign minister and ambassador during an Oval Office visit that he had fired Comey to relieve the pressure۝ from the FBI۪s Russia probe. That firing led to the appointment of Mueller as special counsel by Rosenstein  which has become a focus of Trump۪s anger ever since. That rage appeared to boil over after recent reports that Mueller may be seeking Trump۪s tax returns in connection with the investigation. Trump refused to release his returns during the campaign, a break from decades of protocol for presidential candidates. Painter, the ethics adviser to George W. Bush, said Trump can, if he chooses, pardon his son Donald Trump Jr. , and son-in-law Jared Kushner to protect them from the probe  and face the political consequences. But ending Mueller۪s investigation, Painter said, requires an attorney general ready to go to jail for Trump. He needs to find someone who will be willing to engage in obstruction of justice,۝ Painter said. Criminal obstruction of justice.۝ Listen to S.V.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anthony-scaramucci-deidre-ball-divorce_us_597bb23fe4b0da64e879438c","The wife of newly named White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci reportedly wants a divorce, just days after giving birth to the couple۪s son. The Page Six gossip column of The New York Post on Friday reported that Deidre Ball, 38, had filed for divorce from Scaramucci. Ball began dating the 53-year-old Scaramucci in 2011 and they are believed to have gotten married in 2014, according to the Post. They have two children together , one of whom was born prematurely this past Monday. Ball۪s lawyer, Jill Stone, on Saturday confirmed the divorce story to The New York Daily News, but shot down rumors that Scaramucci۪s naked ambition۝ and desire to be a fixture in President Donald Trump۪s administration drove a wedge between the couple. Whoever decided to state that that was the cause, that has nothing to do with her filing for divorce,۝ Stone told the paper, declining to get into specifics. It۪s a private matter,۝ Stone said. She۪s focusing on the children. She really doesn۪t have a comment at this time.She۪s not going to turn this into a circus.۝ Ball filed for divorce on July 6 in New York۪s Nassau County Supreme Court, according to a Post Page Six story on Saturday. On Monday, Ball gave birth to James Scaramucci two weeks before the child۪s due date. Weighing 5 pounds, 13 ounces at birth, the boy is currently in a neonatal intensive unit, according to the paper. HuffPost reached out for comment to Ball via Facebook, to Scaramucci via Twitter and to White House press office via email. No responses have yet been received. Scaramucci, who had a previous marriage end in divorce, posted two recent tweets that seemed to refer to the reports of domestic discord with Ball.The first came a short time after the Post۪s story. The second came Saturday morning. The Post said that Scaramucci had shed his wedding ring recently or was wearing it on his right hand. Deidre is not a fan of Trump, and she hasn۪t exactly been on board and supportive of Anthony and his push to get۝ a White House job, a n anonymous source reported as close to Scaramucci told the paper. Leonard Sperber, the lawyer hired for Scaramucci۪s first divorce, told the Daily News he had no authority to comment on anything,۝ including whether or not he had been retained a second time. Ball۪s LinkedIn profile lists her as vice president of investor relations for SkyBridge Capital, an asset management business formerly run by her husband. He sold his interest in the business this year in preparation for a job in the Trump White House. After initially serving in a post at the Export-Import Bank, he was appointed to his communications job on July 21, sparking the resignation of press secretary Sean Spicer. On Thursday, the New Yorker magazine published a profanity-laced interview with Scaramucci in which he attacked in vulgar terms then-White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon, Trump۪s chief strategist. Priebus resigned from his job Thursday night and on Friday Trump named as his replacement John Kelly, who had been secretary of the Homeland Security Department."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reince-priebus-out-john-kelly_us_5979fc40e4b02a4ebb739010","WASHINGTON ۥ Reince Priebus is out as White House chief of staff after a tumultuous week of clashes within the administration, a departure that adds to the rising upheaval in President Donald Trump ۪s already-fraught inner circle. Trump announced Friday that he had named John Kelly, the secretary of homeland security, as his new chief of staff. Priebus said he submitted his resignation privately on Thursday. It has been one of the greatest honors of my life to serve this president and our country. I want to thank the president for giving me this very special opportunity. I will continue to serve as a strong supporter of the president۪s agenda and policies. I can۪t think of a better person than General John Kelly to succeed me and I wish him God۪s blessings and great success,۝ Priebus said in a statement on Friday. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said Trump and Priebus had been discussing his role for weeks. She added that Kelly and Trump had also been discussing the job. In an interview with CNN۪s Wolf Blitzer, Priebus declined to provide details on why he decided to quit, but said the president thought it was time for a change. He denied that Trump asked for his resignation. The president has a right to change direction. The president has a right to hit the reset button,۝ Priebus said. I think it۪s healthy.۝ Priebus said he would be working with Kelly for a couple of weeks۝ to help with the transition. He declined to discuss newly appointed White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci۪s incendiary leak accusation. I۪m not going to respond to it,۝ Priebus said. I۪m not going to get into the mud on those kind of things.۝ Priebus flew on Air Force One with Trump on Friday, according to a pool report.Trump waited on board the plane when it returned to Andrews Air Force base, and Priebus initially got into a car with White House aides Stephen Miller and Dan Scavino. They then left his car and got in another one. Some reporters approached Priebus۪ car as they learned of his dismissal, and the vehicle left Trump۪s motorcade before the president departed. Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) said Priebus didn۪t show any signs over being out of a job while riding Air Force One on Friday. We didn۪t even know it. We were sitting right across from him and he kept a poker face,۝ he told reporters. Good poker face, showed nothing.۝ Trump also spoke to reporters on Air Force One. Reince is a good man,۝ he said. John Kelly will do a fantastic job. Gen.Kelly has been a star, done an incredible job thus far, respected by everybody. He۪s a great great American. Reince is a good man.۝ Sanders released a statement Friday, saying the entire Administration loves [Kelly]and no one is comparable.۝House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) also weighed in on Priebus۪ exit, praising the Wisconsin native. Reince Priebus has left it all out on the field, for our party and our country. Here is a guy from Kenosha, Wisconsin who revitalized the Republican National Committee and became White House chief of staff,۝ Ryan said in a statement. He has served the president and the American people capably and passionately. He has achieved so much, and he has done it all with class. I could not be more proud to call Reince a dear friend.۝ The shake-up comes after Scaramucci accused Priebus of leaking his personal financial information. Scaramucci tweeted about the disclosure Wednesday night, and hinted at Priebus۪ potential involvement by tagging him in the post. Hours later, in a subsequent tweet, Scaramucci denied that he had meant to vilify Priebus. But in a CNN interview Thursday morning , he seemed to place the onus on Priebus to clear his name. If Reince wants to explain that he۪s not a leaker, let him do that,۝ Scaramucci said. The publication of Scaramucci۪s financial information, it has since become clear, was not a leak at all. The Politico reporter who first published it said the data she used was publicly available . And in a New Yorker interview published Thursday, Scaramucci publicly and vulgarly attacked Priebus , calling him a paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac.۝ On Sunday, shortly after he began occupying the communications director post, Scaramucci promised to  fire everybody ۝if leaks did not end. The threat ۥ and a subsequent warning about who was in Scaramucci۪s crosshairs ۥ has already prompted a high-profile resignation . White House press aide Michael Short, apparently viewed as a Priebus ally , departed on Tuesday after Scaramucci indicated Short would be his first target when he began to force people out. Priebus۪ exit also comes after the sudden resignation of White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who served as the Republican National Committee۪s communications director when Priebus was its chairman. Spicer left in protest over the news that Trump had appointed Scaramucci as communications director, effectively superseding Spicer with a hedge fund manager with no previous political experience. There have been signs of Priebus۪ waning influence and beleaguered job status for months. After the first version of the Obamacare repeal bill collapsed in the House of Representatives in March, the White House sacked Priebus۪ deputy chief of staff, Katie Walsh , and sent her to Trump۪s outside political group. Rather than speak to Priebus۪ own foibles, however, his departure attests to Trump۪s willingness to pit even his most loyal aides against each another. As chairman of the RNC, Priebus۪ relative neutrality in the 2016 Republican presidential primary and staunch support for Trump in the general election proved crucial. Early on in the presidential campaign, when Trump was drawing scorn and mockery for his xenophobic rhetoric, Priebus was careful, reportedly imploring Trump in July 2015 to ۝ tone it down .۝ Later, when top Republican officials like former presidential nominee Mitt Romney were publicly lambasting Trump, Priebus refused to join them. He also stood by Trump once he became the Republican nominee, relentlessly defending him in the media. When The New York Times published a May 2016 bombshell report about Trump۪s history of mistreating women, Priebus dismissed the revelations . All these stories that come out  and they come out every couple weeks  people just don۪t care,۝ he said. The following month, Priebus helped kill a last-minute bid by so-called never Trump۝ Republicans to run National Review writer David French as an independent conservative, dubbing it a ۝ suicide mission .۝ French cited the remarks as a major contributing factor in his decision to withdraw. Trump rewarded Priebus for his loyalty with the top White House post, enabling Trump to claim a much-needed modicum of respectability with GOP insiders. But from the outset, the Wisconsin attorney and former RNC chairman was undermined by a team of warring White House factions and outsize personalities. Priebus was the highest-ranking White House representative who came from the Republican Party establishment that newcomers like chief strategist Steve Bannon loathed. Bannon, a self-described economic nationalist۝ with a history of racially insensitive comments, has long been suspicious of pro-business Republicans۪ support for open trade and immigration policies. From the start, Trump put Priebus and Bannon on a collision course with the creation of a chief strategist۝ position that appeared to undercut the normally unquestioned authority of the president۪s chief of staff. Trump۪s unconventional decision to name son-in-law Jared Kushner as a senior adviser also created a power center outside Priebus۪ control. But if Priebus was frustrated with the treatment he endured, he refused to publicly show it. When Trump infamously convened his top advisers and Cabinet officials in June to praise his performance before the news media, Priebus۪ comments stood out for their effusiveness. On behalf of the entire senior staff around you, Mr. President, we thank you for the opportunity and the blessing that you۪ve given us to serve your agenda and the American people,۝ Priebus said. And we۪re continuing to work very hard every day to accomplish those goals.۝"

But the lack of a specific motive has not stopped right-wing conspiracy theorists from blaming their opponents  including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), atheists, social justice warriors, communists, the Islamic State, liberals and anti-fascist protesters  for the slaughter. The speed at which these theories spread shows how propagandists take advantage of the information vacuum after a shooting to serve their own ends. The shooting was not racially motivated or caused by religious beliefs, authorities said Monday , though they noted there was a domestic situation.۝ (The suspect, Devin Patrick Kelley, was previously convicted for domestic assault.) But in the hours after the shooting, the public didn۪t know that. Instead, conspiracy theorists took what shreds of information were available to peddle plausible-sounding theories  or simply make up lies. Here۪s how it unfolded: Sunday, 12:30 p.m. ET Around this time, the shooting took place . 1:24 p.m. ET A reporter for KSAT-TV in San Antonio, Texas, tweeted : #BREAKING confirmed shooting at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, police say multiple victims.۝ As news continued to break, most reporters were careful not to draw attention to unverified information. 1:58 p.m. ET Mike Cernovich, a right-wing media personality, had been retweeting some of the few details provided by reporters at outlets like KSAT. But at this time, Cernovich ۥ who portrays himself as a legitimate journalist ۥ sent his own tweet , where he noted that the church had a largely white denomination۝ and speculated, without presenting evidence, Antifa terrorist attack?۝ Antifa is shorthand for anti-fascist and refers to a loose network of activists, some of whom aim to physically confront white supremacists. The group has served as a convenient boogeyman for conservatives, including President Donald Trump. The day before the shooting, far-right media had warned of an antifa apocalypse,۝ with activists waging violent civil war . In reality, an anti-Trump group, Refuse Fascism, had called for peaceful political protests around the country, and a few occurred, without incident . The threatened antifa uprising had failed to materialize . At this point, there were still no publicly confirmed details about the shooter. 3 p.m. ET A screenshot of an alleged message by a guy named Dave Pollack was making the Twitter rounds. Go after the heart of the far-right: conservative churches,۝ he allegedly wrote. This screenshot had previously been shared by Jack Posobiec, a pro-Trump figure, prior to the shooting, on Nov. 3 , according to the Twitter time stamp. Dave۝ will become important. 3:41 p.m. ET A Twitter user named Mustachio۝ shared what he claimed was a video manifesto of the shooter ۥ whom he called a Muslim convert, Samir al-Hajeed۝ ۥ along with fake photos. He was trolling. (Spreading the name Samir al-Hajeed۝ after a shooting is a long-standing hoax .) As Snopes reported , Mustachio was cited by a couple of websites, including right-wing site Freedom Daily , which did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment. 5:37 p.m. ET Around this time, the suspect was publicly identified as Devin Patrick Kelley, and a Daily Beast editor tweeted a story that included pictures from a Facebook page allegedly belonging to the shooter. (HuffPost was not able to independently corroborate this page belonged to Kelley.) People immediately delved into the shooter۪s Facebook likes,۝ which are, in general, a crappy journalistic tool. The suspect allegedly liked atheist pages , CNN and something called Together We Rise, according to Heavy. Conspiracy theorists pointed to the latter as evidence that the shooter supported Bernie Sanders. Some liberal groups with names similar to Together We Rise exist on Facebook, but the only Together We Rise page we could find that users can like on Facebook is a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of foster youth. The shooter also allegedly had a LinkedIn account where he listed causes he supported, including Animal Welfare,۝ Children,۝ Civil Rights and Social Action,۝ Environment۝ and Human Rights.۝ To propagandists, this seemed to prove the shooter was some kind of liberal social justice warrior. In response to a question about whether LinkedIn users simply choose pre-selected causes from a drop-down menu, LinkedIn spokesperson Tatiana De Almeida said, That is correct ۥ there is a dropdown menu of options such as Economic Empowerment, Education and more that the member can select from.۝ People used this information as proof of a motive, anyway. 6 p.m. ET The website YourNewsWire tweeted out an article making wild claims about the shooter۪s connections to antifa. The story cobbled together photos from the Facebook page allegedly belonging to the shooter with a photograph of a different person holding an anti-fascist flag. The article claimed that the shooter vowed to start a civil war by targeting white conservative churches۪ and causing anarchy in the United States.۝ The story also included screenshots from a new guy: Brian (cousin).۝ This person, Brian, supposedly talked to some people who were inside.۝ That۪s how Brian learned that two shooters entered the church, threw an antifa flag over the pulpit and then killed people who failed to properly recite verses from Karl Marx۪s three-volume foundational critique of capitalism, Das Kapital. There is zero evidence any of this happened. The byline on the story was Baxter Dmitry.۝ No one in U.S. public records has that name. The story appeared to be shared more than 264,000 times on Facebook, making it a blockbuster. Dmitry۝ and YourNewsWire did not respond to a request for comment about Brian. 6:14 p.m. ET Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones joined the fray. Jones a prominent promoter of the false theory that antifa was going to violently overthrow the Trump administration on Nov. 4  wondered whether the shooter was part of the Antifa revolution against Christians and conservatives۝ or a Isis op?۝ Authorities have provided no evidence the shooting was connected to the Islamic State militant group also known as ISIS, and again, said it was not religiously or politically motivated. 6:42 p.m. ET Cernovich doubled down. He tweeted that Photos of Texas shooter is consistent with profile of Antifa member. This is looking more and more like Antifa terror.۝ (Authorities have provided no evidence to date of the shooter being tied to antifa.) In response to questions from HuffPost about the legitimacy of his reporting and how he can identify antifa members based on photographs, he asked: Do you disavow this HuffPo column claiming a violent response to Trump is as logical as any۝? Do you disavow this HuffPo column calling for a white wounding۝? Do you disavow poltical [sic] violence by antifa? Or do you see yourself as a PR agent for antifa?۝ (The referenced columns appeared on HuffPost۪s contributor platform and were written by a person who is not a HuffPost employee.) Sunday Afternoon: Remember Dave? Sometime on Sunday, a YouTube user published a video linking the shooter to antifa. It claimed to show the same screenshots of the alleged message posted by Dave Pollack۝ revealing secret antifa plans: Go after the heart of the far-right: conservative churches.۝ Dave۪s message was allegedly made on a Facebook page for It۪s Going Down, a digital community center for anarchists and other activists. Conspiracy theorists pointed to this message, without evidence, as proof that Dave inspired the shooter. We did not have enough information to find Dave. A spokesperson for It۪s Going Down told HuffPost in an email that they couldn۪t find Dave, either. If the screenshots are not fake, we would highly suspect they were posted there by online trolls in the lead up to November 4th, to be used by conspiracy theorists to claim that antifascists wanted to engage in violence against everyday Americans.۝ The group also denied that the shooter is involved with anti-fascist organizing. As the far-Right did after the Las Vegas shooting, they have tried to draw a connection between the two as a means of influencing public debate and also keeping their own conspiracy theory based internet companies and careers afloat,۝ the spokesperson said. That same YouTube video claimed the shooter۪s most recent voter registration showed he listed his political party affiliation as UAF,۝ which the presenter claimed stands for United Against Fascism Party,۝ a British anti-fascist group. The alleged voter registration showed Kelley registered at a former address in Colorado. The United Against Fascism Party۝ is not an active political party in Colorado or Texas. The shooter۪s actual Colorado voter registration states that his party affiliation is UAF.۝ In Colorado, as in many other states, UAF stands for unaffiliated. Kelley۪s Texas voter registration states that he did not register with a political party. The shooter was not registered with any political party, according to public records. Monday Evening By late Monday night, hundreds of thousands of users across multiple platforms had shared fake news about the shooter. As these theories swirled around the internet, Google was criticized for helping spread their rise. Justin Hendrix, executive director of the NYC Media Lab , tweeted screenshots showing that the search engine was listing conspiratorial tweets about the shooter as Popular on Twitter.۝ (HuffPost did not independently verify Hendrix۪s screenshots.) On Monday, the search engine also auto-completed the shooter۪s name, Devin Patrick Kelley, with antifa, according to The Daily Beast.

On Thursday, the conservative radio host announced on his show that he۪d be evacuating South Florida, where he lives, and would be off the air for the next couple of days. This comes mere days after he lambasted media stations for their coverage and storm preparers for battening down their hatches. May as well announce this: I۪m not going to get into details because of the security nature of things, but it turns out that we will not be able to do the program here tomorrow,۝ Limbaugh said on his Thursday broadcast. We۪ll be on the air next week, folks, from parts unknown... Tomorrow will be problematic. Legally impossible for us to originate the program out of here.۝ Limbaugh has long been hell-bent on saying hurricanes and storms like it are part of a liberal conspiracy solely aimed at furthering the discussion on climate change , but his claims about Irma in his Tuesday broadcast sent many over the edge. Limbaugh ranted on air, Here comes a hurricane, local media goes on the air, Big hurricane coming, oh, my God! Make sure you got batteries. Make sure you got water. It could be the worst ever. Have you seen the size of this baby? It۪s already a Cat 5. Oh, my God, oh, my God, it۪s bigger than the island of Haiti.

The views expressed by the host of this program documented to be almost always right 99.8 percent of the time,۝ he said. There is a reason for that because we engage in a relentless and unstoppable pursuit of the truth and we find and proclaim it and that happens to drive people crazy.۝ The devastation of Hurricane Irma is expected to be even more catastrophic than that of 1992_s monster storm Hurricane Andrew."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-business-council-charlottesville_us_59947976e4b0acc593e4757f","The White House۪s two advisory councils of top business executives disbanded on Wednesday amid intense public blowback against President Donald Trump۪s response to the deadly attack by an accused white supremacist in Charlottesville, Virginia. The move came two days after executives began resigning from the dwindling American Manufacturing Council and hours after the billionaire financier who headed the separate Strategic and Policy Forum hosted a call with other members of that panel. Trump took credit on Twitter for dissolving the advisory panels in order to alleviate pressure on the executives. He took the coward۪s way out and disbanded the business council before anyone else bailed out,۝ Jonathan Bernstein, founder of the consultancy Bernstein Crisis Management, said to HuffPost. Rather than face more resignations,he just further proved that he was only interested in people who agreed with him.۝ The tone of Trump۪s announcement was a sharp departure from his previous, combative statements lashing out at those who had already resigned in protest of his refusal to quickly and pointedly condemn white supremacists. After Merck & Co. CEO Kenneth Frazier, the only African-American on the manufacturing council, stepped down on Monday, Trump lambasted his company۪s high drug prices. Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich dropped out later Monday evening, just hours after Trump gave a press conference in which he said that racism is evil۝ and called out the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis. On Tuesday, the president disparaged the two businessmen as grandstanders۝ and vowed to replace them. But his criticism did nothing to stem the departures. Exactly 15 minutes after Trump posted his tweet,Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, quit the manufacturing council. Paul tweeted that  It۪s the right thing for me to do .۝ On Tuesday evening, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka announced his resignation amid mounting pressure from unions in the federation. The retreat continued on Wednesday with Inge Thulin, chief executive of the industrial conglomerate 3M, resigning after  careful consideration .۝Denise Morrison, chief executive of the Campbell Soup Company, resigned soon after. And within minutes of Trump۪s tweet announcing the end of both panels, Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky sent out a press release declaring to be unacceptable۝ the president۪s statements equating those who are motivated by race-based hate with those who stand up against hatred.۝ In an email to HuffPost, a spokeswoman said Gorsky had resolved to resign from the manufacturing council before the president posted his tweet. She did not respond when asked if the White House had alerted Johnson & Johnson of the disbanding of the councils before making it public. The 16 members of the Strategic and Policy Forum, meanwhile, remained mostly quiet. Steve Schwarzman, chief executive of financial giant BlackStone Group, and Mark Weinberger, chief executive of the professional services firm EY, made statements condemning hatred and bigotry, but told HuffPost on Tuesday that they planned to remain on the panel. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon issued a strong rebuke of Trump۪s response to the Charlottesville violence in a statement posted on the company۪s website. But he indicated that he planned to stay on the Strategic and Policy Forum. A spokeswoman for Toby Cosgrove told HuffPost that the chief executive of the nonprofit hospital chain Cleveland Clinic planned to remain on the panel too because it gave him access to the highest level of government to give direct input on healthcare issues.۝ Three executives either declined to comment Tuesday or were away on vacation. The nine other members ۥ including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi and General Motors CEO Mary Barra ۥ did not respond to HuffPost۪s request for comment. On Wednesday, protesters descended on BlackStone and JPMorgan headquarters demanding that their chieftains leave the council. Late that morning, Schwarzman ۥ a close Trump confidant ۥ held a conference call with other members of the Strategic and Policy Forum, according to The New York Times . The executives talked and decided to abandon the group. All those defections are likely to further isolate the White House from the very corporate leaders whom Trump has intensely courted with pledges to lower taxes and eliminate regulations deemed onerous. Even before the violence in Charlottesville and Trump۪s halfhearted response, people had been leaving the Strategic and Policy Forum. In February, then-Uber CEO Travis Kalanick stepped down in hopes of distancing his ride-hailing service from Trump۪s executive order barring travelers from several Muslim-majority nations. In May, Tesla and SpaceX chief Elon Musk resigned after Trump۪s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord left him no choice.۝ Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger also resigned over the president۪s decision to pull the U.S. out of the historic climate agreement, which was signed by every country except Syria and Nicaragua. West Wing infighting, repeated policy fumbles and bombastic public statements from the president have dimmed executives۪ hopes that the Trump administration will accomplish its ambitious pro-business agenda. The instability sown by the president۪s response to the Charlottesville attack, which left anti-racism protester Heather Heyer dead and nearly two dozen injured, won۪t help. He۪s clueless on what to do, he doesn۪t want to admit he۪s clueless on what to do, he brings in advisers, and when they don۪t agree, he fires, criticizes or both,۝ Bernstein said. That is making the entire business world nervous, even though, at first glance, the Trump administration would seem to be business friendly.۝"

Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) was still scrambling to do damage control Monday after it was revealed that he switched his vote on the GOP tax bill to yes soon after a tax deduction was added that could benefit his real estate investments. Asked on ABC۪s This Week۝ on Sunday about the late addition to the tax bill, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said it was meant to cobble together votes۝ to pass the Republican measure . Corker was the only GOP senator remaining Friday who had declared his opposition to the bill. But by the end of the day, after the new deduction became part of the final bill, he issued a surprise statement announcing that he was backing the tax bill because it was an opportunity۝ for business . Voting on the bill is expected to begin Tuesday. Corker had long been opposed to the tax bill because of projections it would add an estimated $1 trillion to the federal budget deficits over 10 years. It۪s possible that the latest version of the bill (with the government getting even less money with the new deduction) could mean even worse news for the nation۪s debt.Corker۪s switch was so troubling۝ because nothing about his concerns about the deficit were addressed, tweeted Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.). Corker is now being lambasted with the trending hashtag #CorkerKickback . The International Business Times has reported that Corker, other GOP leaders and Donald Trump and his family stand to pocket millions of dollars in reduced taxes under the new provision. Corker has denied that his change of heart was related to the new perk and said that he had nothing to do with drafting the provision nor did he know it was in the latest version of the tax bill.Then why did he switch his support if he didn۪t know what was in the new version of the bill? Corker admitted to the IBT: I had like a two-page summary I went through with leadership. I never saw the actual text .۝ Corker wrote Sunday to Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Finance Committee, asking that he clarify how the new deduction came to be in the bill . Hatch۪s letter backed Corker,saying that the Tennesseean had nothing to do with the provision and that he was disgusted۝ by any implication that Corker switched to supporting the bill in exchange for the real estate perk. The new provision tacked on Friday offers a 20 percent deduction on real estate and other income earned through pass-through۝ entities, such as limited liability companies and partnerships.Such companies don۪t pay corporate tax but pass through the income to owners who then pay through their individual tax returns. Under the new bill, Corker could save as much as $1 million in taxes on income from several real estate partnerships, IBT determined. Corker۪s press spokesman did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment. But in an interview with The New York Times, Corker called the accusations against him  disheartening .۝ There۪sʉnothing to buy me off with,۝he insisted.

On Tuesday, Wilson said she was with Myeshia Johnson, a constituent and the widow of the late Army Sgt. La David Johnson, when the president called to express his condolences. She said she overheard the conversation on speakerphone and said Trump told the grieving widow that her husband must have known what he signed up for.۝ The comment sparked a wave of criticism , with many calling it insensitive.

Scaramucci announced during Friday afternoon۪s press briefing that deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders will take over Spicer۪s role. Spicer۪s messaging frequently clashed with that of President Donald Trump . Trump most recently contradicted Spicer۪s Jan. 31 explanation that the president۪s controversial executive order on immigration was not a ban.۝ I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!۝ Trump tweeted on June 5, days after a major attack in London prompted him to renew his call for the Supreme Court to reinstate the order to bar citizens of six majority-Muslim countries from traveling to the U.S. Spicer۪s tenure was marred with questionable moments, including a struggle with White House messaging on the firing of FBI Director James Comey on May 9.At one point, Spicer hid among some bushes to avoid answering journalists۪ questions about Comey۪s firing. CNN reported the next day that Trump and his team had monitored Sanders۪ performance at the White House daily press briefing, where she filled in while Spicer fulfilled his U.S. Navy Reserve duty. Spicer was tapped to be Trump۪s press secretary in December 2016. Before that , he worked as chief strategist and communications director for the Republican National Committee.

He accused members of the media of engaging in deliberately false reporting۝ and refused to take questions. Spicer۪s war with the media continued throughout his time in the White House press office. In February, he blocked several news outlets , including CNN and The New York Times, from attending an off-camera press briefing. In March, he was criticized for telling senior journalist April Ryan to stop shaking her head . In April, Spicer claimed Nazi leader Adolf Hitler never used chemical weapons . Spicer went on to refer to the gas chambers used to kill millions of Jews as Holocaust centers.۝ He later sent a clarification on his remarks that he revised three separate times . Spicer used his position to spread falsehoods and repeat unverified claims made by Trump, including accusations of widespread voter fraud and claims that Obama had ordered wiretapping of Trump۪s team during the 2016 presidential election.

Robert E. Lee in Emancipation Park Saturday night was littered with evidence of President Donald Trump ۪s cultivation of the far right: protest signs with messages like The Jewish Media Is Going Down,۝ The Goyim Know۝ and We Support President Donald Trump.۝ Only several hours earlier here, white supremacist demonstrators and counter-protesters had engaged in open combat for hours . The sounds of screams had mixed with the sounds of people coughing, their lungs full of mace. Tear gas canisters and rocks and full water bottles and bags of feces flew through the air. Blood stained the sidewalk. A few blocks away at the intersection of Fourth Street and Water Street Saturday night, police collected evidence from where a 20-year-old white supremacist named James Alex Fields Jr. had allegedly plowed his car into marching counter-protesters, sending bodies flying. A 32-year-old paralegal named Heather Heyer was killed and at least 19 others were injured. Police removed metal barricades from the street as a helicopter circled overhead. Nearby bars, usually bustling on a Saturday night, were shuttered and empty. On the sidewalk, a lone Always Anti-Fascist۝ poster  dropped or discarded during the day۪s chaos  stared up from the sidewalk. Meanwhile, at a friend۪s house in the area, 25-year-old Eli Mosley stepped away from a party he and his white supremacist buddies in the alt-right۝ group Identity Evropa were enjoying to talk to HuffPost over the phone. His voice was hoarse. He had spent the day screaming and chanting among thousands of like-minded people carrying Nazi and Confederate flags to protest the potential removal of the giant Lee statue in the park. The Anti-Defamation League said it was the largest gathering of white supremacists in more than a decade. Our people are feeling real good right now,۝ he said. We view this is as a civil rights movement at this point. We۪re advocating for white rights and white people, who will soon be a minority in this country. This day was a milestone pushing us into our next stage. We had a large turnout.۝ We۪re coming back to Charlottesville,۝ he added defiantly. The clashes like the one in Charlottesville are largely a phenomenon of the Trump era. Over the past year, HuffPost has followed the white nationalists in their escalating war with their extremist opposite, from Berkeley to Portland to New Orleans to Gettysburg . In May, again in Charlottesville , white nationalists marched with torches and chanted Nazi slogans. Over the course of these battles, each side has grown angrier, and more heavily armed. Eli Mosley is typical of the alt-right۝ movement ۥ the latest incarnation of organized racism in America ۥ which has grown exponentially larger since Donald Trump announced his run for the White House. He۪s young and media-savvy and knew how to bring thousands of white supremacists together for Saturday۪s Unite The Right۝ rally. Years ago people like Mosley saw themselves as a fringe group in American politics. Now, under Trump, they feel like their views are gaining momentum, even becoming mainstream, they say. In Trump۪s statement about Charlottesville Saturday, he refused to specifically condemn the white supremacists who besieged this picturesque college town. We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides ۥ on many sides,۝ he told reporters during a late-afternoon news conference in New Jersey. White supremacists were more than pleased with his reaction. Trump۪s comments were good,۝ read a post on the prominent white nationalist site Daily Stormer as they live-blogged yesterday۪s events. He refused to answer a question about White Nationalists supporting him,۝ the post continued. No condemnation at all. When asked to condemn, he just walked out of the room. Really, really good. God bless him.۝ With a president of the United States not condemning Nazism, and after over a year of signaling his support for white nationalism, experts are deeply concerned that we۪re in store for political violence even worse than the kind that visited Charlottesville. That۪s because an emboldened fringe right, has in turn, emboldened the far left. Professor Brian Levin, head of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, said in an interview with HuffPost by phone that the fatality and injuries Saturday ensure that the much smaller and less coalesced far left,۝ which includes anti-fascist or Antifa protesters, would go looking for revenge.۝ It۪s a reciprocal dance of extremism,۝ Levin said. Heidi Beirich, head of the Southern Poverty Law Center۪s Intelligence Project, agreed. When anti-fascists show up to violently fight white supremacists, she said, it only gives oxygen۝ to the white supremacist cause. We۪re concerned this is going to spill out of Charlottesville into many other places,۝ she added. Something that would go a long way in breaking this vicious cycle, they both agreed, is decisive action from the White House. In a statement Sunday the Anti-Defamation League spelled out what that action could be. The group called on Trump to terminate all staff۝ with any ties to white nationalists, likely referring to prominent White House advisers Steve Bannon, Steven Miller, and Sebastian Gorka, all of whom are linked to racist, fringe figures and groups. This is a moment that demands moral leadership,۝ ADL President Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement. President Trump should acknowledge that this is not a matter of equivalence between two sides with similar gripes. There is no rationalizing white supremacy and no room for this vile bigotry. It is un-American and it needs to be condemned without hesitation.۝ On Sunday morning, Eli Mosley said he was preparing to leave the house where he had partied and slept the night before with his fellow white nationalists. He said he thought Trump۪s comments were neutral in a way۝ that he liked. He claimed to have lost his job three months ago after being exposed as a white nationalist online. He said he۪s working full-time now as an alt-right organizer. For this new life, he said he was preparing to drive home to Pennsylvania Sunday so he could pack his things for a move to Virginia. In Virginia, he said, he could more easily organize the next big alt-right rallies in the state capital, Richmond, and of course, in Charlottesville.

The Republican majority in Congress has voted dozens of times since 2011 to repeal all or part of the Affordable Care Act, and a central element of the GOP۪s pitch to voters during last year۪s election was that giving Donald Trump the keys to the White House and leaving Congress in the Republican Party ۪s hands was all that was needed to bring an end to Obamacare. But when presented with their first genuine opportunity to do so ۥ and to have to answer for the consequences ۥ enough Republican senators flinched that the effort failed, despite pressure from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and President Trump.

Collins and Murkowski had looked apt to vote no all week after opposing the motion to proceed to the initial legislation. For nearly an hour, Republicans ۥ including Vice President Mike Pence, who was on-hand to break a tie ۥ tried to persuade McCain and Murkowski to no avail. They had made up their minds. McCain, who was diagnosed with brain cancer last week, was only on hand because of a dramatic return Tuesday to open debate on the bill. After voting for the motion to proceed to the bill, McCain delivered an impassioned speech in which he indicated he didn۪t support the health care plan. But many thought that, with the scaled-down version of the bill up for consideration, McCain would vote to advance the legislation so that the Senate could conference the bill with the House. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) offered some assurances that he would establish a conference committee, but they apparently weren۪t enough for McCain. Or, at least, McCain thought it was time Republicans try a new approach. The entire health care process has been marked by an incredible breach of the normal congressional procedures. Even the vote itself came in the wee hours of the morning Friday , capping off an extraordinarily rushed, chaotic and secretive legislative process. Senators had about three hours to weigh the consequences of legislation McConnell hastily assembled Thursday and made public after 10 p.m. EDT . McConnell pulled the bill and returned it to the Senate calendar, which enables him to bring it back up at a later date if he chooses. Republican congressional leaders have pledged since the Affordable Care Act became law that they would repeal it, and Trump made that a main tenet of his 2016 presidential campaign. In its place, they promised to establish a new and better health care system with lower costs and more choice. As Congress has considered repeal this year, the promise to kill the law has been the primary, if not solitary, rationale for hurrying ahead with legislation that could add millions of people to the ranks of the uninsured and cause turmoil in the health insurance market. In the end, this motivation proved inadequate for three Republican senators. And with that, the Obamacare repeal campaign is as close to dead as it has ever been. The law has now survived the Republican takeover of Congress, President Barack Obama ۪s 2012 reelection campaign, two Supreme Court rulings and Trump۪s victory last year. The bill that died in the Senate on Friday would not have fully repealed the Affordable Care Act. The Health Care Freedom Act was limited to striking a handful of the law۪s core elements. The legislation would have eliminated the fines associated with the law۪s mandate that most Americans obtain health coverage or face tax penalties and canceled enforcement of its requirement that large companies offer health insurance to full-time workers until 2025. Left in place would have been Obamacare۪s health insurance exchanges and subsidies for low- and middle-income families, its provisions guaranteeing coverage to people with pre-existing conditions and a standard set of benefits, its Medicaid expansion, and its myriad rules and regulations on the health insurance industry. The Senate bill wouldn۪t even have repealed all of the Affordable Care Act۪s taxes, such as those on wealthy people, but it would have extended a current moratorium on a tax on medical device sales until 2021. The legislation also would۪ve halted federal payments to Planned Parenthood for one year. Under this legislation, health insurance premiums would have risen by 20 percent and 16 million fewer people would have health coverage ۥ 15 million of them next year alone, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected in a report released Thursday night. In spite of the Senate vote, repeal remains the stated goal of the Republican Party , and polls indicate its core voters still want it. And Trump, who۪s been clear he would sign any health care bill that could clear Congress, won۪t like being denied a political win this early in his tumultuous presidency. House Republicans also won۪t be satisfied. In May, the lower chamber passed its own bill to repeal and replace۝ the Affordable Care Act. Lawmakers who supported that legislation will be displeased that the Senate۪s failure made their risky vote meaningless. The House۪s American Health Care Act would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 23 million , according to the CBO, and disadvantage older, poorer and sicker people in the health insurance market. The legislation passed the House by a narrow margin with some lawmakers voting yes ۥ ironically, in hindsight ۥ with the expectation that the Senate would come up with a better bill. It did not. As for the Senate, the collapse of repeal on Friday strongly suggests that there isn۪t a deal that can be made and that Republican senators may be eager to move on to other business. Theoretically, the House bill could serve as a vehicle to revive the repeal effort. But senators immediately rejected it when it passed. And on Tuesday, the Senate failed to achieve a majority on a broadly similar bill, the Better Care Reconciliation Act . That Senate bill would۪ve added 22 million people to the ranks of the uninsured, according to the CBO. Moreover, the principal problem confronting congressional Republicans isn۪t the fine details of the policies contained in the various bills lawmakers have considered this year, nor is it arcane procedural rules that complicated their legislating. At its heart, the dilemma is that the Republican Party does not have, and has never had, a clear vision of what kind of health care system it wants. Republicans have become skilled at pointing out the Affordable Care Act۪s failings and imperfections ۥ the real ones, the exaggerated ones and the fabricated ones. But they have never agreed on how to fix those problems or how to reform the health care system in ways that deliver on their promises of lower costs and more choice. Nearly 2,700 days have passed since Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law. Yet on the one day the Senate had its best chance to repeal it, Republicans still didn۪t have a plan.

The percentage of voters identifying as Democratic has remained at 44 percent. The lower numbers could be a cause for alarm for the GOP in midterm elections next year.

The number of Hispanics who identify with the GOP has dropped 3 percent. Intriguingly,there has been a 1 percent increase in African Americans who identify with the GOP, Gallup found. But that number was extremely low to begin with: Only 10 percent of black Americans considered themselves Republicans a year ago. College graduates saw a 4-point dip in identification with the GOP, while those without a bachelor۪s degree saw a 5-point drop. There are now more Americans who consider themselves independents with no leanings toward either party (14 percent, compared with 10 percent a year ago), or do not have an opinion (5 percent, compared with 4 percent last year), Gallup found. Those identifying with the Democratic Party have maintained an edge over followers of the rival party throughout the year from 5 to 9 points because GOP affiliation has dropped.

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-pardon-joe-arpaio_us_599da366e4b0a296083b9758","WASHINGTON ۥ President Donald Trump on Friday pardoned a notorious former Arizona sheriff who willfully violated a federal judge۪s order by unlawfully detaining individuals his officers claimed might be in the country illegally. Former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who had previously proclaimed himself America۪s toughest sheriff,۝ was convicted of criminal contempt last month for violating a 2011 order that barred Arpaio and his office from detaining individuals solely based on suspicions about their legal status. Arpaio, 85, was scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 5. Throughout his time as Sheriff, Arpaio continued his life۪s work of protecting the public from the scourges of crime and illegal immigration,۝ the White House said in a statement late Friday. Sheriff Joe Arpaio is now eighty-five years old, and after more than fifty years of admirable service to our Nation, he is a worthy candidate for a Presidential pardon.۝ Trump۪s pardon of Arpaio, the first of his presidency, amounts to a tacit endorsement of Arpaio۪s discriminatory tactics and reads as a favor to a political ally. The media-savvy former sheriff, known for parading inmates around in pink underwear,supported the former reality TV star۪s presidential campaign and spoke at the Republican National Convention last summer. Both men were prominent promoters of the racist conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama wasn۪t born in the United States. Arpaio, who served as sheriff from 1993 through 2016, had long been accused of discriminatory practices against Latinos. A 2011 report by the U.S. Department of Justice۪s Civil Rights Division concluded there was reasonable cause to believe that Arpaio and his office engaged in a pattern or practice of unlawful policing and racial profiling. Arpaio۪s officers called Latinos wetbacks,۝ Mexican bitches,۝ fucking Mexicans۝ and stupid Mexicans,۝ the Justice Department found, and Latino drivers were four to nine times as likely to be stopped by his officers as non-Latino drivers were. A lawsuit filed by the Justice Department was settled in 2015 . With his pardon of Arpaio, Trump has chosen lawlessness over justice, division over unity, hurt over healing,۝ Cecillia Wang, deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement Friday. Once again, the president has acted in support of illegal, failed immigration enforcement practices that target people of color and have been struck down by the courts. His pardon of Arpaio is a presidential endorsement of racism.۝ Arpaio took a break from dinner with his wife on Friday night to call into Sean Hannity۪s program on Fox News. Hannity said Arpaio was convicted ... only of criminal contempt۝ and said he was very relieved۝ for Arpaio. Arpaio said that it was great۝ to hear about the pardon and that he loves the president. Hannity, who apparently thought that a former sheriff charged with a federal crime would have somehow landed in his former county jail, joked with Arpaio about the conditions in Arpaio۪s former facility, referencing pink underwear and the bologna sandwiches served there. But Arpaio said incarceration wouldn۪t have been that big of a deal. Sean, it۪s federal, I could play bocce. ... It would۪ve been alright,۝ he said. At a Tuesday evening rally in Phoenix, Trump had signaled that the pardon was coming . The president claimed Arpaio had beenʉconvicted for doing his job.۝ But Trump said,ʉI۪ll make a prediction: I think he۪s going to be just fine, OK?۝ Ahead of his trial, the Justice Department had argued that Arpaioʉ viewed his defiance of the federal government۪s directives on immigration as a badge of honor۝ and bragged about his deputies۪ contemptuous immigration enforcement practices to the press.۝ In finding Arpaio guilty of criminal contempt, U.S. District Judge Susan R. Bolton said in July that the former sheriff had shownʉflagrant disregard۝ for the 2011 order banning him from detaining people because he thought they were in the country illegally. Not only did Defendant abdicate responsibility, he announced to the world and to his subordinates that he was going to continue business as usual no matter who said otherwise,۝ Bolton ruled on July 31. The evidence at trial proves beyond a reasonable doubt and the Court finds that Judge Snow issued a clear and definite order enjoining Defendant from detaining persons for further investigation without reasonable suspicion that a crime has been or is being committed; that Defendant knew of the order; and that Defendant willfully violated the order by failing to do anything to ensure his subordinates۪ compliance and by directing them to continue to detain persons for whom no criminal charges could be filed.۝ Arpaio۪s lawyers have since moved for an acquittal , arguing that the government۪s handling of the case reeked of unconstitutional selective prosecution.۝They questioned the court۪s motivations۝ in not allowing a jury trial.They also claimed that the verdict was driven by the desire to vindicate the authority of a fellow judge.۝ And they argued that Arpaio had a right to be present for the issuing of the verdict, which was in fact emailed to his lawyers. The prosecution has not yet responded to the defense۪s motion. Trump۪s pardon of Arpaio skipped over the typical review process for pardons , which are usually routed through the Justice Department۪s Office of the Pardon Attorney. The pardon came less than two weeks after the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that turned deadly when a neo-Nazi sympathizer crashed his vehicle into a crowd of anti-racist demonstrators. Trump faced criticism for what was seen as his lackluster condemnation of white supremacists and his attempt to equate the racists in Charlottesville with those who turned out to oppose them. Civil rights advocates like Vanita Gupta, the former chief of the Justice Department۪s Civil Rights Division, warned that pardoning Arpaio ۥ who she said  personifies the same bigotry and intolerance we witnessed in Charlottesville۝ ۥ would sow hate and division. If President Trump uses his power to pardon a discredited law enforcement official who persistently engaged in illegal racial profiling of the Latino community, it will not be a dog whistle to the so-called alt right۪ and white supremacists, but a bull horn,۝ Gupta said. This is a developing story. Check back for updates."

Kammen noted in his letter that he has served the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the State Department in a number of roles since 1996. The Science Envoy program , which he was a member of, brings together U.S. scientists and engineers to identify opportunities for sustained international cooperation.۝ Kammen is one of seven envoys listed on the State Department website.

Multiple members of two White House advisory boards resigned in protest of the president۪s comments,and he officially disbanded the councils. Kammen in his letter also pointed to Trump۪s efforts to undermine energy and environmental research, as well as his decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Accord on combating climate change, as moves he finds unacceptable.

The man, a retired public relations professional in the western United States who asked not to be identified, read ProPublica۪s story this week on Kasowitz and sent the lawyer an email with the subject line: Resign Now.۪۪ Kasowitz replied with series of angry messages sent between 9:30 p.m. and 10 p.m. Eastern time. One read: I۪m on you now. You are fucking with me now Let۪s see who you are Watch your back , bitch.۝ In another email, Kasowitz wrote: Call me. Don۪t be afraid, you piece of shit. Stand up. If you don۪t call, you۪re just afraid.۝ And later: I already know where you live, I۪m on you. You might as well call me. You will see me. I promise. Bro.۝ Kasowitz۪s spokesman, Michael Sitrick, said Thursday he couldn۪t immediately reach Kasowitz for comment. ProPublica confirmed the man۪s phone number matched his stated identity. Technical details in the emails, such as IP addresses and names of intermediate mail servers, also show the emails came from Kasowitz۪s firm. In one email, Kasowitz gave the man a cell phone number that is not widely available. We confirmed Kasowitz uses that number. The exchange began after the man saw our story featured last night on the Rachel Maddow show on MSNBC. We reported that Kasowitz is not seeking a security clearance even though the Russia case involves a significant amount of classified material. Experts said Kasowitz could have trouble getting a security clearance because of what multiple sources described as a recent history of alcohol abuse. Former employees also said Kasowitz had engaged in behavior that made them uncomfortable. Since the story was published, his spokesman issued a statement disputing several parts of the story: Marc Kasowitz has not struggled with alcoholism,۝ Sitrick wrote. He has not come into the office intoxicated, attorneys have not had to go across the street to the restaurant during the workday to consult Kasowitz on work matters.۝ The rigorous background investigation that goes into getting security clearance also considers any information relevant to strength of character, honesty, discretion, sound judgment, [and] reliability.۝ The exchange of emails Wednesday began at 9:28 p.m. Eastern when the man sent the following message to Kasowitz۪s firm account. Five minutes later, Kasowitz responded with two words: Fifteen minutes after that, Kasowitz sent a second email: The man responded politely: But Kasowitz continued to harangue him: And then, just 33 minutes after the man۪s initial email, Kasowitz sent a fourth response, referring to his own Jewish heritage and the man۪s name, which he presumed to be Jewish. The man told us that the email exchange disturbed him so greatly he forwarded it to the FBI so there would be a written record in case Kasowitz followed through on the threat. Experts in the laws on harassment and online threats differed on whether Kasowitz۪s emails could put him in legal jeopardy. When considering whether words constitute a true threat versus protected speech, the threat has to be credible and the person has to intend to make the victim fear imminent physical harm,۪۪ said Danielle Citron, a University of Maryland law professor and author of a book on online harassment. Citron pointed in particular to Kasowitz۪s statements: I already know where you live۝ and you will see me. I promise.۝ She said: That۪s incredibly troubling language. If I۪m a prosecutor I۪m going to think hard about that.۝ Ron Kuby, a New York lawyer who argued a case that overturned a portion of the state۪s harassment law on free speech grounds, said he believed Kasowitz had not violated the law with his missives. When Kasowitz says things like I already know where you live۪ he is inching closer to the line. But in my view  as someone who despises the Trump administration, but who has litigated these issues  he is well on the legal side of the line.۝ For over 15 years, Trump has periodically retained Kasowitz, who has cultivated a tough-guy image.

Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.) took a victory lap in her feud with President Donald Trump after the White House was caught falsely maligning her for the second time this week. Twice this week the White House accused Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.)of lying and each time the facts have vindicated her version of events. Most recently,evidence emerged disproving an accusation by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly that Wilson had gloated over securing funds for an FBI building in her district. Earlier this week, Wilson escalated a political firestorm over President Donald Trump ۪s response to the deaths of four American military service members in Niger. After bragging of his willingness to call the families of fallen troops, Trump spoke with the loved ones of the most recent casualties, including Myeshia Johnson, the widow of Army Sgt. La David Johnson, and a constituent of Wilson۪s. Wilson, who was with Johnson when Trump called and heard the conversation on speakerphone, said Tuesday that Trump had told Johnson that her husband must۪ve known what he signed up for.۝ The comments during a condolence call, Wilson said,showed that Trump has no feelings for anyone.۝ Trump responded the following morning by alleging that Wilson totally fabricated۝ the conversation and claiming he had proof۝ that her version of events was not true. Then, on Thursday, La David Johnson۪s mother Cowanda Jones-Johnson , who said she was also present during the call, corroborated Wilson۪s version of events. Yes, the statement is true,۝Jones-Johnson said. I was in the car and I heard the full conversation.۝ Caught in a lie, the White House, which had never offered evidence to contradict Wilson۪s description, quickly shifted its public relations strategy. In remarks to the White House press corps on Thursday, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly suggested that Trump spoke appropriately. Kelly, whose own son died serving in Afghanistan, recalled his son۪s commanding officer saying something similar. He knew what he was getting himself into,۝ Kelly said, quoting his son۪s commanding officer. It was exactly where he wanted to be. That was the message.۝ But in keeping with Trump۪s relentless combat with critics, Kelly could not resist taking another false potshot at Wilson. As part of a larger attempt to paint Wilson as a political showboat, Kelly alleged that Wilson had taken credit for securing the federal funding for the construction of a new FBI building in Miramar, Florida. Kelly was present at the 2015 ceremony dedicating the building in his capacity as head of the U.S. military۪s Southern Command. A congresswoman stood up, and in a long tradition of empty barrels making the most noise, stood up there in all of that and talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building, and how she took care of her constituents because she got the money, and she just called up President Obama, and on that phone call, he gave the money, the $20 million, to build the building, and she sat down,۝ Kelly said. Here too, Kelly was either gravely mistaken or deliberately lying. The legislation allotting the federal funds for the creation of the building passed Congress in 2010, shortly before Wilson began her first term in office, McClatchy reported on Friday. Instead, Wilson drew praise at the ceremony from Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (Fla.) and then-FBI director James Comey for pushing through legislation naming the buildings after two deceased FBI agents. Wilson during her ceremony speech took credit for ensuring that the buildings were named after the agents, but not for securing the funding, according to a video of the event obtained by the Sun-Sentinel . CORRECTION : This article initially identified Cowanda Jones-Johnson as Sgt. La David Johnson۪s aunt, she is his mother."

John Kasich , a top Republican leader and former candidate for the party۪s presidential nomination, on Sunday said the GOP may be on a trajectory to lose supporters like him. If the party can۪t be fixed, Jake, then I۪m not going to be able to support the party, period,۝ he told Jake Tapper on CNN۪s State of the Union,۝ a few minutes after he noted that Americans seem more eager to hear from independent candidates than ever before. The governor۪s comment came in response to a question about how Republicans should react to Alabama politician Roy Moore securing their party۪s nomination for that state۪s open Senate seat. Moore is a former judge who was twice removed from Alabama۪s Supreme Court for violating legal standards, and Tapper noted that he has said homosexual conduct should be illegal, questioned the birthplace of former President Barack Obama and suggested Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) should not be allowed a position in Congress because he is a practicing Muslim. Well, look, I don۪t run the party. I can tell you for me, I don۪t support that. I couldn۪t vote for that. I don۪t know what the heck I would have to do, but I don۪t live in that state. I mean, those claims are ۥ I mean, they۪re ludicrous and they۪re divisive,۝ Kasich said, adding that the party needs to be fixed۝ to limit the influence of far-right elements and he sees his job as trying to get that done. The governor said he hopes figures like Moore do not represent the GOP۪s future. Tapper explicitly asked if Kasich might split from the GOP if it continues being associated with figures like Moore. No, not at this...۝ the governor responded, trailing off as if to hint that a time may come when he would consider parting ways with GOP. What I۪m saying to you is, we need to fix it. If our party, if the Republican Party is going to be anti-immigration, if it۪s not going to be worried about debt, if it۪s going to be anti-trade, this is not where our party can be. So I۪m going to fight like everything I have... it۪s why I۪m on these shows, because I want this party to be straightened out. But I not only want the party to be straightened out, I want the country to be straightened out. And so it۪s really a battle again inside of both parties, but people are beginning to say, I don۪t like either of them. And that says something big. So hopefully our party leaders will pay attention to this.۝ Despite his criticisms of President Donald Trump , Kasich retains influence in the party because of his popularity in Ohio and is seen as a standard-bearer for GOP centrists distressed by Trump۪s rise. He۪s also cultivated an image as a uniter, in contrast to Trump۪s divisiveness, reaching out to Democrats on issues like health care reform. The governor recently ruled out rumors of his running in 2020 on a joint ticket with Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-tax-bill-pass_us_5a395ec8e4b0c65287acc5f5","WASHINGTON ۥ After years of false starts and failed promises ۥ including another one Tuesday when House Republicans passed a tax bill with provisions that were struck down by the Senate parliamentarian ۥ House Republicans once again passed the final version of the GOP tax bill Wednesday , sending the bill to President Donald Trump۪s desk. Even though House Republicans had already passed a nearly identical form of this bill, and had already congratulated themselves in a series of speeches Tuesday, the House voted again Wednesday, 224-201, to pass the tax bill, this time with the stricken provisions omitted. The Senate passed this version of the bill on a party-line, 51-48 vote early Wednesday morning. House Republicans had passed what they thought would be the final tax proposal on Tuesday , 227-203, with 12 Republicans voting no.The bill passed Wednesday with the same 12 Republicans voting no, but with three absences on the GOP side and four absences on the Democratic side. It was a small gaffe that led House lawmakers to need to vote again, but one typical of this process. Republicans rushed a bill to the floor and ended up embarrassing themselves. Still, the hiccup was just a formality. Even though the Senate parliamentarian struck down college savings provisions benefiting home-schooled children ۥ a provision important to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) ۥ the bill still flew through the Senate late Tuesday night into Wednesday morning and had no trouble on Wednesday in the House. The bill is, without a doubt, Trump and the GOP Congress۪s most significant legislative achievement since Republicans gained control of the House, Senate and White House. But the win۝ may end up costing Republicans. This bill is far from the congressional victory Republicans had sought to run on during next year۪s midterm elections: It۪s deeply unpopular, with approval ratings that were already significantly under water and grew worse over the past few weeks as the legislation neared final passage. A CNN poll in November showed 31 percent of voters viewing the tax bill favorably, with 45 percent opposing it. A poll conducted in the past week showed 33 percent supporting the bill, but 55 percent now against it. When Senate Republicans passed their initial version of the measure just a few weeks ago, many Republicans didn۪t care that the bill wasn۪t popular. Republicans simply believed the lack of support was due to bad polling and voters not fully understanding the proposal. Likewise, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told reporters Tuesday morning that he had no concerns whatsoever.۝ I got to say, if people are out there on TV telling mistruths, disguising the facts of this thing, that۪s going to make it unpopular,۝ Ryan said, adding that taxpayers will be happy when they see changes in their pay next year ۥ both from adjustments to taxes withheld from their paychecks and higher pay from booming business conditions. But the facts of this bill are what make it unpopular. For one, the bill repeals the individual mandate in Obamacare, which would result in higher prices for people relying on Obamacare for health insurance. And far from a middle-class tax cut,۝ as Trump and other Republicans promised, the measure is truly a massive corporate tax cut ۥ the top rate goes down from 35 percent to 21 percent ۥ and a smaller tax cut for individuals in the seven individual income brackets. Independent analysts have said wealthy taxpayers would benefit the most, in large part because they pay more taxes from the start. But households at every income level would see a tax cut next year, according to an analysis of the conference bill from the Joint Committee on Taxation, which scores tax legislation for Congress. Starting in 2021, however, some income groups would start seeing slightly higher rates. And because the proposal sets most individual cuts to expire in eight years ۥ a budget gimmick to reduce the bill۪s cost in a 10-year budget window ۥ all households earning less than $75,000 would see higher taxes in 2027(due in large part to the bill including an unfavorable permanent change to the way tax brackets are indexed to inflation) Republicans have waved off concerns about the sunsetting tax cuts by saying a future Congress won۪t let them expire. That۪s a change from Ryan۪s position earlier this year, when he insisted the cuts be permanent. In the end, Ryan got half his way ۥ the corporate tax cuts are permanent, but the individual reductions are not. Republicans finance these cuts, in part, by raising taxes on some people. The bill ends much of the state and local tax deduction, which lets filers write off the cost of their local taxes. As a compromise to some of the high-tax states most affected, the bill allows filers to deduct up to $10,000 of their local taxes by some combination of their choice. But that won۪t be enough for many high-income people in states like New Jersey, New York and California. As with an earlier version of the bill, a number of Republicans from New Jersey and New York voted against the legislation, though most California Republicans still got onboard. Republicans chose a policy approach that came with a built-in political headache: They have been unable to guarantee that no household would face higher taxes under the plan even as it piles on all that debt. If their bill simply cut tax rates, everybody would benefit. But because of the way the bill lowers rates while eliminating deductions ۥ thereby exposing more income to taxation in some cases ۥ Republicans have been unable guarantee a tax cut for everybody. So even though most households would be better off under the changes next year, some will be worse off. Still, the majority of the bill is paid for۝ by increasing deficits. The measure would add $1.4 trillion to the national debt,the Joint Committee on Taxation said. Republicans have claimed that increased economic growth would boost business receipts and offset the revenue loss, though no credible economic analysis has shown that. Republicans have largely ignored those criticisms by just focusing on how the tax cuts would boost the economy. They۪ve also largely looked past the effects on housing, charitable giving and state budgets. Those effects flow from a simplification of the tax code. The legislation would increase the standard deduction from $12,700 to $24,000 for a married couple (an increase Republicans have falsely characterized as doubling۝ the deduction ). Currently, only about 30 percent of households find it worthwhile to itemize۝ for expenses such as mortgage interest, charitable donations and local taxes. With the bigger standard deduction, experts say only 5 percent would. While their tax filing process would be simpler, for many households, the tax incentive to take out a bigger mortgage or donate to charity would be smaller, which could squeeze housing markets and the nonprofit sector. And a new cap on the amount of local taxes that can be deducted would put pressure on state lawmakers to either reduce those taxes ۥ resulting in less revenue for priorities like public education ۥ or shift them to other sources that are still deductible, such as business payrolls. Don۪t be a high-tax state,۝ Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.) said after the vote. Be a low-tax state  According to Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the Senate parliamentarian said three provisions were ineligible for the fast-track process, including one measure allowing parents to use special 529 savings accounts for home-schooling expenses. In the mad dash to provide tax breaks for their billionaire campaign contributors, our Republican colleagues forgot to comply with the rules of the Senate,۝ Wyden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said in a joint statement. The lead House author of the bill, Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), has said he expects Congress will need to pass another bill next year to fix any mistakes in the tax bill .

Kennedy School of Government for the fall semester. His appointment was in keeping with the trend of America۪s broadly liberal institutions falling all over themselves to give a prominent platform to our country۪s worst, most illiberal voices, in an idiot kabuki of broadmindedness. According to the institute , Spicer is supposed to be engaging students in discourse on topical issues of today۝ by giving bright young minds a look at the inner workings of White House communications. Instead, according to a student who attended one of Spicer۪s Q&A sessions, The entire thing was just a defense of every waking moment he served.۝ He is a flack once more, only this time for himself. Over the course of this week, Spicer has been holding court during breakfasts, lunches, dinners and lectures to pass along to the groups of commingling graduate and undergrad students the many lessons of public service he digested along with all those pieces of gum in his time at the White House. HuffPost spoke with several of these students, who have been granted anonymity because the sessions were off the record,per the Harvard institute۪s standard visiting fellow rules. The school probably didn۪t need to worry too much. As one student explained,ʉHe۪s incredibly inarticulate, so it was really difficult to take any sort of notes.۝ The Harvard Kennedy School features a mostly liberal student body, and its students were particularly upset over the school۪s decision to rescind Chelsea Manning۪s fellowship while keeping that of both Spicer and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Despite that,everyone HuffPost spoke with said the questions Spicer received were relatively tame. No questions were pre-screened, but the sessions۪ moderators had full control over who was able to get in a question. Spicer, for his part, had his talking points ready.The students HuffPost spoke with emphasized that, regardless of the question, Spicer tended to circle back to a few familiar themes. Benghazi, for instance. Here are a few lessons Spicer imparted to the public servants of tomorrow,paraphrased by two students who attended several of Spicer۪s sessions: On politics today A lot of the problems in politics today come from the fact that we don۪t take the time to understand each other, and that we should listen first and then protest.If you dialogue with a politician on the other side, you۪re seen as a sellout by your own party. On the media Politico recently did an article on me, and they said that I was a press secretary when I was in the RNC, and if they can۪t get that right then what can they get right? [Spicer was the RNC۪s communications director.] One New York Times reporter had said to me, How can you face the fact that you work for a racist fascist?۪ That reporter can۪t possibly have been objective because he holds those views, and more broadly the media was incredibly biased in covering Trump. On why the Trump administration keeps lying Were you upset when Benghazi was blamed on a video by Jay Carney, Hillary Clinton and Susan Rice? There were no challenges from the media then. The Trump administration is being held to an unfair higher standard. Well, Obama promised that with Obamacare you wouldn۪t have to switch your doctor, but you did. On why Sean Spicer, specifically, lied I۪m a spokesperson for the president, and my job is to say what he wants me to say. I said in the first press conference that the inauguration was witnessed by the most people ever, so I was also talking about social media and online reporting of the inauguration, not just crowd sizes, which are obviously hard to calculate. On the difference between alternative facts and lies An alternative fact is 3+1=4 or 4+0=4. Those are alternative facts. A lie is 3+2=4. Alternative facts are legitimate tools to use in politics. On what Sean Spicer regrets I regret a lot of things. I regret things every day of my life, and I apologize. On the difference between working for the RNC and working for the White House Not much. On Sean Spicer۪s proudest White House moment My proudest moment as press secretary was getting the opportunity to give people tours of the White House. On Sean Spicer۪s coolest White House moment The coolest moment as press secretary was having the New England Patriots all standing in my office waiting to go meet the president. When I was growing up, I had to sit in the middle bleachers and watch them from the stadium. Now I have the whole starting lineup in my office and got to take a selfie with them before they met Trump. On White House press briefings White House press briefings are a waste of time. Reporters had the chance to go and knock on my door and see me any time, but they would only ask questions during the White House press briefing so they could be on camera. They could have asked me at any other time of the day.[HuffPost White House reporter S.V. Date reports thatʉthe door was almost always closed. You needed his gatekeeper۪s permission to get in. I never got permission.۝] On life after the White House I will continue to support the Trump agenda. I۪ve been at Harvard three days and no one has said anything negative publicly to my face. All very illuminating.We۪ve reached out to Spicer for comment and will update if he responds. Let۪s not forget, though, that this is about the students. And what are the students taking away from this encounter with a master of his field? I learned that the media was not misrepresenting him in how they were talking about him six months ago,۝ said one Harvard Kennedy School student. I was kind of expecting him to be better than how he was portrayed through the press, but he was pretty much just as slimy and weaselly as I۪d thought he was.۝"

Joe Biden served in the Senate from 1972 until 2008, while McCain has been a senator since 1987.

Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) introduced the resolution on Friday. Should the results of said exam be unfavorable, the resolution calls for Vice President Mike Pence and members of the Cabinet to remove Trump from office. The move would invoke the 25th Amendment , a rarely used constitutional provision that allows the vice president and a majority of Cabinet members to jointly remove the president from office and replace him with the vice president.

The Atlantic reported Saturday that their reporters had spoken to three Gold Star families who received condolence packages from the president this week. Timothy Eckels Sr., whose son Timothy Eckels Jr. was killed when the USS John S. McCain collided with a merchant ship in August, told the magazine he had not heard from Trump until Friday, Oct. 20.His letter from the White House was dated Oct. 18. The families of Corey Ingram and John M. Hoagland III,two other sailors who died in the USS John McCain collision, also received rush-delivered packages from the White House this week, according to the Atlantic. The sudden outreach appears to follow mounting criticism over Trump۪s reaction to the Niger ambush that killed four U.S.soldiers. When asked during a Monday press conference why he hadn۪t publicly acknowledged the deaths in Niger, Trump pitted himself against past presidents, saying he had written the soldiers۪ families personal letters, while President Obama and other presidents ... didn۪t make calls.۝ On Tuesday, Trump followed up that remark by claiming he had calledʉvirtually۝ all Gold Star families who had lost kin since he took office. To the best of my knowledge I think I۪ve called every family of somebody who۪s died,۝ Trump told Fox News۪ Brian Kilmeade during a radio interview . It۪s the hardest call to make ... the hardest thing for me to do is to do that.۝ He later hedged his claim to Kilmeade saying, I have called, I believe, everybody ۥ but certainly I۪ll use the word virtually everybody.۝ Hours after that Oct. 17 radio broadcast, the White House scrambled to identify and find the contact information for Gold Star families who lost a service member since January,according to an internal Defense Department email obtained by political news site Roll Call. The email exchange, between the White House and the Pentagon, revealed that senior White House aides knew Trump۪s statement about having called virtually۝ all Gold Star families was not accurate ۥ and they needed to correct it as soon as possible. The White House was attempting to find out which Gold Star families Trump had not yet reached out to, according to Roll Call. Multiple news outlets have found Trump has yet to reach out to a number of families who lost loved ones since January. In a report published Wednesday, the Washington Post interviewed the families of 13 service members who were killed after Trump took office: Half of the families received phone calls from the president, the remainder had not heard from Trump. The Associated Press reported it had reached out to the families of all 43 people who have died in military service since Trump became president,۝ but only made contact with about half of the families.۝ Some families told AP they were comforted by Trump۪s call, while others hadn۪t heard from the president. The family of Army Sgt. Jonathon M. Hunter, who died in a suicide bombing in Afghanistan in August,was promised a call from the president but instead heard from Vice President Mike Pence. Brittany Harris, the widow of Army Spc. Christopher Michael Harris who also died in Afghanistan in August, said she had not heard from the president either.

In one sense, the wins should have been expected: President Donald Trump is extremely unpopular , and the party that holds the White House usually does worse in congressional, state and local elections in years when the president isn۪t on the ballot. And the victories were expected in some cases. In New Jersey, Democrat Phil Murphy ,a former Goldman Sachs banker, consistently led in the polls and will now be the next governor. But elsewhere, outcomes were more uncertain. Many Democratic activists were worried that the party was going to let the Virginia governor۪s mansion slip from its grasp. Concern that Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam was failing to excite the base, along with a fear-mongering anti-immigrant campaign run by Republican Ed Gillespie, led to concerns it would be a repeat of the 2016 presidential race. Northam, however, sailed to victory Tuesday , guaranteeing Democrats a seat at the table when state legislative and congressional districts get redrawn in 2020. The party won the races for lieutenant governor and attorney general, too. The night was validation for the many activists around the country who joined the resistance after Trump۪s win and have been feverishly working at the grassroots to mobilize the party۪s base. There۪s no doubt that the victories will provide a jolt of energy for what۪s coming in the 2018 midterm elections. Today۪s progressive victories in Virginia make one thing clear: A newly awakened grassroots movement is rising up to reject Trump۪s politics of hate and reclaim political power,۝ said Maria Urbina,the political director of the progressive Indivisible movement, which has more than 180 active groups in Virginia. Democrats also saw the wins as a rejection of the type of nationalism championed by Trump and his former aide, Breitbart News Executive Chairman Steve Bannon, who maintained that a win by Gillespie in Virginia would prove that Trumpism without Trump can show the way forward.۝ Tonight, the message for Democrats and the country is that fear and division and hatred do not work,۝ Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) said. They don۪t work here in Virginia, and they۪re not going to work in Virginia.۝ Trump attempted to distance himself from the crushing GOP losses Tuesday night, tweeting from South Korea that Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for.۝ Almost no one expected Democrats to do as well as they did in the Virginia House of Delegates. Democrats targeted the 17 GOP-held districts where Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton defeated Trump. Winning all of the seats would swing control of the chamber, but few thought it was possible. Republicans have controlled the state۪s house of delegates for nearly two decades and held a 66-34 majority. The last time Democrats picked up more than one seat in the body was 2007, when they gained four . Last week, Virginia Democratic National Committeewoman Yasmine Taeb estimated that a pickup of six to eight seats would constitute a success.۝ But by 9:30 p.m., Democrats had already picked up 14 Republican-held seats in the House of Delegates, with eight more in play. Northern Virginia, a Democratic stronghold, turned only bluer. Voters outside a polling location in Fairfax, which supported Clinton by a two-to-one margin in 2016, cited health care, education and Trump as top issues that drove them to the polls Tuesday. It seems like the other guy, Gillespie, he۪s being supported by Trump, and [the president] tweeted about him,۝ Soleyman Ahmed, who voted for Northam, told HuffPost. Northam seems like he۪s a doctor, he۪s served in the government, he۪s got experience that could help.۝ The electoral wave lifted the fortunes of even very left-wing candidates, including Democrat Lee Carter, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America and supporter of single-payer health care. He unseated GOP House Majority Whip Jackson Miller in Northern Virginia۪s 50th District. Carter, a former Marine, failed to provide the state Democratic Party with daily updates about his campaign, prompting the party to deny him aid and go silent on his bid. The Washington, D.C., chapter of DSA stepped in to help with canvassing, and on Tuesday Carter won. In Virginia۪s 13th District, outside Fredericksburg, voters ousted Republican Del. Bob Marshall, the author of the state۪s bill to ban transgender people from using the bathrooms of their choice, and replaced him with Danica Roem, a transgender woman who ran on a platform of fixing the area۪s transit problems. Virginia Democratic Del. Charniele Herring said Roem۪s victory sends a message to politicians that the politics of bigotry is over. It۪s not acceptable to voters.۝ Chris Hurst , a former Roanoke news anchor whose girlfriend was fatally shot by a colleague on-air in 2015, beat an incumbent Republican in the state۪s 12th District, which stretches from Blacksburg, the home of Virginia Tech, to the West Virginia border. This isn۪t a wave. This is a tsunami,۝ said David Toscano, the Democratic leader in the Virginia House of Delegates. The wins in New Jersey, Virginia and Washington, where Democrats won a key Washington state Senate seat  and, with it, control of the only part of the state government they didn۪t already run  will have real policy consequences in the short term. Northam will be able to veto Republican legislation in Virginia, and Democratic pickups in the Virginia House of Delegates will give him much more leverage in the legislature. New Jersey, where Murphy ran on promises to legalize marijuana and introduce public banking will be under full Democratic control for the first time in nearly a decade.In Washington, Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee and the Democratic-controlled legislature will have much more freedom to enact their agenda. The election results will affect lives in other states, too. In Maine, voters approved a ballot measure expanding Medicaid to tens of thousands of people over the objections of Paul LePage, the state۪s Republican governor.In New York City, Bill de Blasio  who achieved a longstanding liberal goal of creating a universal pre-kindergarten program  became the first Democratic mayor to win reelection since Ed Koch in 1985. The big question for Democrats now will be whether they can translate wins in this year۪s elections to victories in next year۪s congressional midterm elections. The Virginia electorate in 2017 is not the same territory as the battlegrounds Democrats will face next year  for one thing, Trump is more unpopular in the state than he is in the nation as a whole . And, as FiveThirtyEight recently noted , Virginia۪s off-year results haven۪t been so predictive۝ as a barometer of each party۪s strength in the following midterm House races. But what Democrats hope is that the GOP loss in Virginia ۥ where Gillespie played up the nativist message popularized by Trump ۥ will make Republicans rethink their strategy. I think the appeal to the bad side of human instinct ۥ which Donald Trump did when he ran, and now Republicans are adopting ۥ does not serve America well, but won۪t serve them well either,۝ Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told HuffPost on Tuesday, before the results came in. Next up: A Dec. 12 special election for a U.S. Senate race in deep-red Alabama, where Roy Moore, a controversial-but-Republican judge , is narrowly leading former U.S. attorney Doug Jones, a Democrat, in the polls. But on Tuesday night, most Democrats were still focused on celebrating their victories, not preparing for the long slog ahead. The Democrats are like the field goal kicker who۪s missed three kicks in a row,۝ said Jared Leopold, communications director for the Democratic Governors Association. Now we۪ve made a few, and we۪ve got our groove back.۝ Welcome to the bounce-back,۝ said Paul Kent, an elated union member who attended Northam۪s victory party on Tuesday.

It was the fall of 1975, and the Columbia law student was interviewing for an internship at Weil, Gotshal & Manges, a prominent New York firm known for its prowess in antitrust litigation, the area of law he۪d decided was his future. As he walked into the men۪s room after his interview,he noticed a group of extremely tall men shuffle in behind him. One of them stepped up to the urinal next to him. It was Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the 7-foot-tall Los Angeles Lakers superstar. Kessler was stunned, even a little confused. Antitrust law and the world of professional sports had begun to overlap in the decade prior, when St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Curt Flood sued Major League Baseball to overturn the league۪s reserve clause, which bound players to their teams ۥ and restricted their salaries ۥ unless they were traded. But u ntil the moment Abdul-Jabbar sidled up next to him at the urinal, Kessler hadn۪t realized that his firm was at the center of another major sports case: a lawsuit brought by Milwaukee Bucks guard Oscar Robertson, the head of the NBA۪s players union, that aimed to end the NBA۪s version of the reserve clause, which limited free agency rights and gave teams near-complete control over their players. Kessler was a sports fan, and had long harbored an urge to work in public service. Growing up in the Sea Gate neighborhood in the outer reaches of Brooklyn, he was hardly a hippie, but he found it impossible to ignore the civil rights, feminist and anti-war movements erupting around him. An accomplished student, Kessler felt called to use his abilities to do some good in the world, and he saw the law ۥ and antitrust law, specifically ۥ as a way to do that. But at a time when the U.S. government had found a renewed zeal for using antitrust law to take on giant corporate monopolies, he۪d never considered a future in sports law. Now he was surrounded by NBA players who۪d come to Manhattan to take part in Robertson۪s case. I remember going home to my wife and saying, You۪re not going to believe who I saw in the men۪s room today,۪۝ Kessler said. Kessler never actually worked on that Robertson case. But soon after it settled, he joined the firm full-time, and over the next four decades, he would establish a reputation as one of the nation۪s pre-eminent sports lawyers ۥ a bulldog attorney willing to take up the cause of virtually any athlete who felt he (or she) had been wronged by the league above them. He began representing NBA players in the 1970s and NFL players in the ۪80s.

He۪s worked on behalf of all four major men۪s professional sports unions and the United States women۪s national soccer team. He has counted Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing, Tom Brady and Bill Belichick among his clients. All of that has led to perhaps the biggest case of his career: Jenkins v. the NCAA. The case, which Kessler filed on behalf of three college athletes in 2014 , could upend major college sports as we know them. Although there have been other major lawsuits against the NCAA in recent years, none have targeted the entire system of college athletics quite like this one. Kessler and his plaintiffs aren۪t seeking monetary damages. Instead, they want federal courts to rule that the existing model of major college sports ۥ specifically, men۪s basketball and football ۥ violates federal antitrust law. If they win, they could reshape the current collegiate sports structure, forcing schools and major conferences to finally pay athletes in their two biggest sports. But the case, like many of his previous battles in sports, isn۪t just about money: To Kessler, it۪s fundamentally a fight for college athletes۪ rights.  If we win,۝ Kessler told HuffPost, it could make a big difference.۝ The nature of Kessler۪s suit is a threat to the NCAA, but the real danger it poses stems directly from his involvement in it. The structure of professional sports gives athletes considerably less power than team owners and league executives. Over the last 40 years, though, Kessler has become athletes۪ David to the leagues۪ Goliath. Driven by a relentless belief that his clients are being wronged, he has used antitrust law to win ever-expanding rights for the players he represents. That instinct to do battle with the powerful was forged even before he stumbled into sports law.In 1976, Kessler and his fellow first-year law students at Columbia put on a musical. Kessler wrote a song to the tune of the Frank Sinatra number from the opening scene of Guys and Dolls,۝ said his classmate Allan Van Fleet. The modified lyrics, Van Fleet recalled, took direct aim at IBM, the computing giant that was then at the center of one of the country۪s largest-ever antitrust lawsuits. The course is antitrust, For me it is a must, Watching IBM go bust _۝ Kessler sang. For Jeff it was a must,۝ said Van Fleet, who also went into antitrust law. Some of us fell into it later.۝ Kessler was kind of a young idiot savant in the antitrust world۝ when he joined Weil, Gotshal & Manges full-time in 1977, said Jim Quinn, who worked on the Robertson case for the firm. Together, Quinn and Kessler built out the firm۪s sports law and antitrust practice, taking up more NBA cases and a lawsuit filed by the North American Soccer League against the NFL. Eventually, they represented NFL and NHL players in labor disputes and court cases as well. Then, in 1990, Kessler and Quinn picked up their biggest case yet: a lawsuit filed by New York Jets running back Freeman McNeil, who alleged that the league۪s restrictive free agency system artificially held down player salaries and violated federal antitrust laws. The NFL۪s case rested on the testimony of University of Iowa economics professor George Daly, who told the jury that his studies showed that free agency would spell economic ruin for the NFL,۝ according to a Sports Illustrated account of the trial. But on Sept. 7, 1992, in a courtroom in Minneapolis, Kessler launched into a devastating examination of Daly۪s claims that destroyed the NFL۪s case. Kessler repeatedly forced Daly to admit that he had not studied several aspects of the NFL۪s economic system, including how much money owners diverted out of revenues and into their own salaries, or how free agency might impact NFL revenues and salaries. Kessler pointed to Daly۪s projections that free agency would have harmful effects on Major League Baseball, even though it hadn۪t then (it still hasn۪t now). And he forced Daly to admit that he hadn۪t even reviewed football۪s financial statements or summaries. You are not an expert on statistics or on football, are you?_ Kessler asked near the end of his time with the witness, according to UPI reports from the time. No, I am not an expert on football,۝ Daly said. Then why do you say changing the [free agency] system in football would hurt the competitive balance of the game?۝ Kessler asked. I would defer to the football people on why they think that is important,۝ Daly said. It was a devastating encounter for the NFL. Four days later, the jury ruled that the league had violated antitrust laws, a decision that led to the creation of its modern free agency system. He۪s very difficult to outdo,۝ Quinn said of Kessler. He۪s quick on his feet, he comes up with very persuasive and sometimes novel theories and arguments, and they have a tendency to stick.۝ One reason Kessler has emerged as perhaps the most successful labor-side lawyer in sports is his belief in the righteousness of the cause athletes are fighting, said DeMaurice Smith, the executive director of the NFL Players Association, for which Kessler serves as outside counsel. You can find a lot of lawyers who certainly possess the expertise to fight the cause,۝ Smith said. But you either have the passion for the morality of the cause, or you don۪t.۝ In 2008, Kessler helped Oscar Pistorius , the South African sprinter born without the bottom halves of his legs, win the right to compete against able-bodied athletes at the Olympics, a case he considers a big win for disability rights.۝ Kessler is also currently representing members of the U.S. women۪s national soccer team, who shortly after winning the 2015 World Cup filed a lawsuit against their governing body in an effort to win equal pay to their male counterparts. That case, Kessler says, has a lot of meaning for the equal pay movement generally, way beyond sports, and even internationally.۝ (Indeed: U.S. senators and other equal pay advocates have continually highlighted the case as an example for the broader push for equal pay legislation.) Representing players in fights over money and, as he terms it, greater economic rights in their sports, is another front in that battle ۥ my way of fulfilling my initial goals to do cases that I think are protecting a group of people who are often mistreated,۝ he says. The suit against the NCAA ۥ like those against the NFL and NBA before it ۥ is not a discrimination case. But it۪s impossible to ignore its racial implications. A majority of the athletes in Division I men۪s college basketball and football, Kessler notes, are African American, while the people who reap the financial rewards of the current system ۥ college administrators, athletic directors, television executives and coaches ۥ are primarily white men. A lot of the athletes in both of those sports are African American,۝ he says. That is the reality. And a lot of these players, both white and black, come from fairly impoverished backgrounds. So the fact that they۪re exploited this way ... is a social justice issue.۝ At times, the passion that feeds Kessler۪s often-acerbic tongue has earned the ire of his opponents at the bargaining table, and even those in the sports media. In 2011, during a bitter labor dispute between the NBA and its players union, Kessler and NBA Commissioner David Stern۪s relationship boiled over after Kessler accused NBA owners of treating their players  like plantation workers .۝ Stern, who through an NBA spokesperson declined requests to comment for this article, told The Washington Post then that Kessler was  the single most divisive force ۝ in the negotiating process, and that his conduct was routinely despicable.۝ Anonymous sources from the players union even distanced themselves from the remarks, NBA legend Magic Johnson called them ridiculous,۝ and the sports media went to town, publishing stories about how Kessler۪s absence from negotiations improved the prospects of the two sides reaching a new labor deal. (Kessler, it should be noted, wasn۪t alone: HBO commentator Bryant Gumbel also compared Stern to a plantation master during the 2011 NBA lockout.) Kessler began exploring ways to take on the NCAA late in 2013, when his firm, Winston & Strawn, created a division solely focused on legal issues within college sports . There are good (legal) arguments that Division I football is basically a business, and that students are exploited as workers,۝ he told me in an interview that year . And therefore schools should be free to compensate athletes in any manner that they want to, without NCAA restrictions.۝ At a press conference ahead of Super Bowl XLVIII in February 2014, Kessler met Ramogi Huma, a former linebacker at UCLA who by then had become one of the country۪s biggest advocates for expanding the rights of college athletes. Huma was helping football players at Northwestern University in their attempt to form the first players union for college athletes , but he was also dreaming bigger.He wanted to strike at the heart of the NCAA۪s amateurism model, to destroy the pillar of the system the NCAA has used to defend itself in court. After chatting at the press conference, the pair agreed to meet for lunch near Kessler۪s office later in the week. Huma was immediately sold.ʉI۪ve talked to a lot of lawyers who wanted to bring cases,۝ Huma says of Kessler now, and none of them talked like that.۝ Together, Huma and Kessler worked to find a college athlete who could serve as a plaintiff on the suit. Huma had one in mind. He called Martin Jenkins, a defensive back at Clemson University. Jenkins had sensed something wrong with the collegiate model when, not long after he arrived at Clemson, the Tigers۪ compliance staff rattled off the long list of rules about what athletes are and aren۪t allowed to do if they want to maintain their eligibility to play. Red flags started going off in my mind,۝ Jenkins told HuffPost. This wasn۪t fair to the players, it wasn۪t fair to the people on the field who were doing the work.۝ Huma asked Jenkins if he۪d meet with Kessler, and Jenkins agreed. He seemed more excited and energized than I was, and I was really excited to be involved in it,۝ Jenkins said. In March 2014, a month after Kessler and Huma۪s meeting in New York, Kessler sued the NCAA. It has now been more than three years since Kessler sued the NCAA on Jenkins۪ behalf. In the interim, the case has picked up two other named plaintiffs ۥ former Middle Tennessee State football player Anfornee Stewart and ex-Wisconsin basketball player Nigel Hayes, who became an outspoken advocate for the rights of college athletes during a career that included two appearances in the Final Four. The big business of college sports, meanwhile, has only continued to explode.Today, the men۪s NCAA Tournament alone provides the organization with nearly $900 million annually in television revenue, while individual conferences have television contracts worth billions of dollars over their lifespans, and schools pay coaches and athletic directors multimillion-dollar salaries. Collectively, the men۪s basketball programs that make up Division I and the football programs in the Football Bowl Subdivision generate more than $7 billion in annual revenues. Big-time college sports look more like their professional counterparts than they ever have, with one major exception: The NCAA has restrictive rules in place that prevent schools from compensating athletes beyond the full cost of attending. The economics here are that basketball and football have become gigantic businesses,۝ Kessler said. The total revenue for basketball and football in Division I is greater than the total revenue of the NBA. It۪s greater than the total revenue of the NHL. _ It۪s the third biggest sport by revenue in this country. The idea that these are not businesses, it makes no sense. And you should allow those who are producing this revenue to be treated in a fairer way.۝ But even though Kessler believes college athletes should be better-compensated,he and his clients aren۪t seeking financial damages. The point of the case isn۪t to remedy past wrongs, but to completely alter the relationship between players and the system and prevent those wrongs from continuing.That۪s what makes the Kessler case different from other antitrust cases filed against the NCAA, including that of former UCLA basketball star Ed O۪Bannon, who won a partial victory for college athletes that allowed them to receive cost-of-attendance stipends beyond the value of a scholarship. During the O۪Bannon suit, NCAA president Mark Emmert suggested that even the largest athletic programs would  move toward a Division III model ۝ of college athletics if they had to pay their athletes (D-III schools don۪t offer athletic scholarships). Conference and university administrators have suggested that they can۪t afford to pay athletes, or that doing so would violate the spirit of amateurism in college sports. Kessler has read the headlines and heard these arguments. He knows some believe that his case could  suck the magic out of college sports ۝ and turn them into glorified minor leagues that fans simply wouldn۪t watch. But even if he wins, he argues, the outcome won۪t be nearly as dire or drastic as the skeptics predict. Kessler۪s primary argument is not against the NCAA itself, but its amateurism rules specifically. What violates antitrust law, he argues, is that the schools and major conferences band together under those rules to artificially cap the compensation an athlete can receive for his services to a school. In Kessler۪s world, conferences could set their own rules regarding compensation, then compete against each other: The Big Ten might stick to the current rules, for instance, while the Southeastern Conference might elect to pay athletes above and beyond the value of a scholarship. Another might follow the Ivy League model and refuse to grant athletic scholarships at all. The result would be something of a free market for men۪s basketball and football players. Alternatively,the NCAA, its schools and their conferences could follow in the path of major pro leagues, and negotiate a new system with athletes or a body that represents them. I know what they۪re going to argue in court,۝ Kessler said, sitting up in his chair and clapping his hands together, his voice nearly cracking from excitement ۥ and frustration. They۪ll argue what they۪ve always argued: that amateurism is this holy grail. The new version of it is that if you pay one penny more than the full cost of attendance ... the world will come to an end.۝ There are obvious parallels to his previous cases, where the NBA, Major League Baseball and the NFL all contended that more rights, and more money, for players would spell doom for their products. Free agency, of course, has had none of the dramatic and devastating effects the owners once predicted: Salaries have risen tremendously, sure, but so have revenues. Leagues, owners and players are all vastly richer today than they once were. It۪s utter and complete nonsense,۝ Kessler said. Allowing baseball, football, basketball and hockey players greater economic freedom and compensation did not destroy the NFL or NBA. It did not destroy the NHL or Major League Baseball. It made those sports fairer and better. It did not decrease popularity or interest in the Olympics.۝ It۪ll be interesting to see how it plays out,۝ Quinn, Kessler۪s former partner, said. I think the NCAA has some problems on its hands.۝ Last fall, U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken ۥ who also oversaw the O۪Bannon suit, and ruled that the NCAA was in partial violation of antitrust law ۥ rejected the NCAA۪s motion to dismiss the Jenkins case. The two sides have conducted expert depositions and discovery over the last six months, a process that will conclude this month. They۪ll return to court for hearings in August, and the case likely will head to trial sometime in 2018. It seems almost impossible that the two sides will reach a settlement before then, given the NCAA۪s steadfast refusal to bend unless forced. It is likely to take years for the case to reach a final resolution. Kessler is prepared to fight it all the way to the Supreme Court if he has to. But Kessler is confident, and his excitement that a potential trial is drawing nearer is obvious as soon as he begins talking about it. Among those on his side, there۪s a sense of optimism that Kessler is leading the fight. There۪s no question that this is the best possible case that could be brought,۝ Huma said. And a big part of that is because Jeff Kessler is heading it up.۝ CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misstated the year that Kessler encountered Abdul-Jabbar in the men۪s room; it was 1975, not 1976."

Donald Trump Jr. initially claimed the meeting with Kremlin-linked lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya was simply to discuss an adoption program. But after further reporting, the Times discovered that Trump Jr. had been promised the information about Clinton before arranging the meeting. Trump Jr. then released another statement that differed from his original explanation, offering two versions within a 24-hour period. On Saturday, the Times uncovered the meeting, which took place June 2016. It۪s the first confirmed meeting between Trump۪s inner circle and Russian figures during the presidential campaign, amid multiple investigations into whether Trump۪s campaign colluded with Russia. The meeting was also attended by Trump۪s then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and son-in-law Jared Kushner, now a senior White House adviser. Prior to the Times reporting that Veselnitskaya had promised damaging information about Clinton,Trump Jr. released a statement to the media on Saturday: It was a short introductory meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up. I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand.۝ Then on Sunday, he admitted to the Times that he was asked to meet with an individual who I was told might have information helpful to the campaign.۝ He clarified on Monday that he knew in advance that the meeting pertained to Clinton. In a Sunday statement to several news organizations, including Reuters, Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Trump۪s outside legal team handling matters related to the Russia probes, said that the president was not aware of and did not attend the meeting.۝ The Kremlin also denied knowing about the meeting, according to The Associated Press. Kushner has been under investigation after failing to disclose his own meetings with Russian officials during Trump۪s transition in December, and the Times found this new revelation through a revised version of a form that Kushner filled out to receive a government security clearance. So far, the investigations into whether Trump campaign officials colluded with Russia have focused on more indirect campaign associates, including former advisers Carter Page and Roger Stone, and now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Trump۪s former national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned in February after misleading administration officials about the extent of his own interactions with Russian officials. It is unknown whether Veselnitskaya, a lawyer who has represented Russian state-owned businesses and the son of senior Russian government official, actually had damaging information about Clinton, the Times reported. Trump Jr. addressed the Veselnitskaya meeting in a new statement Sunday but revealed the real reason he, Kushner and Manafort had attended: to obtain information that would be helpful to the campaign.۝ I was asked to have a meeting by an acquaintance I knew from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant with an individual who I was told might have information helpful to the campaign. I was not told her name prior to the meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to attend, but told them nothing of the substance. We had a meeting in June 2016. After pleasantries were exchanged, the woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton. Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information. She then changed subjects and began discussing the adoption of Russian children and mentioned the Magnitsky Act. It became clear to me that this was the true agenda all along and that the claims of potentially helpful information were a pretext for the meeting. I interrupted and advised her that my father was not an elected official, but rather a private citizen, and that her comments and concerns were better addressed if and when he held public office. The meeting lasted approximately 20 to 30 minutes. As it ended, my acquaintance apologized for taking up our time. That was the end of it and there was no further contact or follow-up of any kind. My father knew nothing of the meeting or these events.۝ On Monday , music publicist Rob Goldstone confirmed to several news outlets that he was the acquaintance who set up the meeting. Goldstone۪s client, singer Emin Agalarov, is the son of a Russian real estate mogul who had planned to partner with Trump to develop a Trump Tower in Moscow . In addition, Agalarov and Trump appeared in a music video for the 2013 Miss Universe pageant , which Trump owned at the time and took place in Russia that year. Later on Monday, the White House defended Trump Jr.Deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed that the elder Trump learned of the meeting in the last couple of days.۝ She also affirmed that Don Jr. did not collude with anybody to influence the election.۝ No one within the Trump campaign colluded,۝ she said, in response to the other Trump campaign officials with links to Russia. Sanders claimed the real problem was the inappropriate۝ leaks of information, a frequent line of attack from the Trump administration. The only thing I see inappropriate about the meeting was the people that leaked the information on the meeting after it was voluntarily disclosed,۝ she said. Read the Times۪ full report here .

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ryan-zinke-lisa-murkowski_us_5979f846e4b0da64e8773002","WASHINGTON  With a couple of phone calls to Alaska۪s Republican delegation, the Trump administration apparently thought it could bully Sen. Lisa Murkowski into supporting her party۪s attempt to repeal Obamacare . The approach was both rookie and reckless, according to former Interior officials. In the end, the Alaska senator stood her ground , joining two other Republican senators in defeating a skinny۝ repeal of the Affordable Care Act early Friday morning. The issue began when Murkowski voted Tuesday against a measure to begin debate on a health care bill. President Donald Trump used Twitter the next day to voice his dissatisfaction, saying Murkowski  really let the Republicans , and our country, down.۝ On Wednesday night, the Alaska Dispatch News first reported that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke had phoned Murkowski and fellow Alaskan Sen. Dan Sullivan (R) following Tuesday۪s vote.Zinke delivered aʉtroubling message,۝ indicating that Murkowski۪s defection could jeopardize future Alaska projects, in particular those involving energy extraction,Sullivan told the paper. In other words, Zinke wanted Murkowski to fall in line ۥ or else. But what Zinke and Trump apparently failed to consider before issuing the apparent threat is that government is a two-way street  and Murkowski has a great deal of influence. As chairwoman of both the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies,Murkowski has oversight over the Interior department and its funding. That puts her in a unique position to either advance or obstruct the administration۪s energy priorities. Alaska is among the nation۪s largest producers of oil and gas, and will likely prove key to the administration۪s push for energy dominance.۝ If the administration were to follow through on its warning, it would likely involve reversing course on opening additional areas of the state to energy developmentʉ a move at odds with its own policies. It۪s like, Don۪t move, I۪m going to shoot myself,۪۝ said Pat Pourchot, who worked as special assistant for Alaskan affairs under two interior secretaries, Sally Jewell and Ken Salazar. Zinke and Murkowski both support increased fossil fuel production in and around Alaska, and appear to have a lot to gain by working collaboratively. The Trump administration is looking to expand offshore drilling and open up currently protected areas of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans to oil and gas development. And Zinke signed a secretarial order May 31 to jump-start۝ oil production in Alaska, including in the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge.During a trip to the state in May, Zinke posted a photo showing him, Murkowski and several others standing alongside the Trans Alaska Pipeline . Last month, the Interior Department also took a first step toward allowing a controversial road to be built through Alaska۪s Izembek Wildlife Refuge  a project the Obama administration refused to green light and which Murkowski strongly supports. The administration probably could not follow through on its threat without negatively impacting its own interests, said Kate Kelly, who served as the communications director and senior adviser under Interior Secretary Jewell. The Interior Department did not respond to HuffPost۪s request for comment. Experts also noted that it was bizarre for an Interior secretary ۥwhose job it is to manage some 500 million acres of federal land, including 59 national parks ۥto call sitting senators to relay a vague-but-threatening message over a vote on an issue unrelated to the agency. There are so many things that seem to make this a pretty novice move,۝ said Kelly. Murkowski is beholden to no one, so the calculation that she would be swayed by this phone call is an interesting one.۝ Pourchot couldn۪t recall anything like this happening in his six years at the department. I scratch my head,۝ he told HuffPost. I don۪t particularly favor our government acting like this  in these raw, retribution-type of scenarios. But also, I don۪t understand the politics of it for the Trump administration.۝ A third former Interior official echoed Pourchot۪s comments, saying they were not aware of any other Interior secretary calling in such a threat against a member of Congress. There were times that Zinke۪s predecessors would talk to a legislator in an attempt to calm or improve a situation, the former official said, but never to deliver a threat or antagonize. In an interview with Politico, Alaska Oil & Gas Association President Kara Moriarty called the threats  unfortunate .۝  As the secretary has said , they want to have American energy dominance, and the only way to do that is through Alaska,۝ Moriarty told the publication. When the time comes when Alaskan energy projects are in front of Congress, I hope they are considered on their merits and not used as a political chits.۝ Murkowski has dismissed the idea that Zinke۪s phone call was a threat against her or her state.ʉHe was just sharing the concern that the president expressed to him to pass on to me,۝ she told the Associated Press, adding that she and Zinke have a cordial, respectful and friendly relationship.۝ On Wednesday, however, Murkowski postponed indefinitely a Thursday hearing to consider several of Trump۪s nominations to the Interior and Energy departments. She did not offer a reason. And while some speculated it was meant to send a message to the Trump administration, Murkowski told CNN that was not the case and that the delay was to work out a little bump.۝ In a post to Twitter, Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, speculated that Zinke۪s phone calls would result in an investigation by the inspector general and possibly the Department of Justice. Richard Painter, the former chief White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush,went a step further and called for Zinke to be removed from his post. Interior Department controls vast parts of our Country and cannot be allowed to use federal lands for an extortion racket,۝ Painter wrote on Twitter. Fire Zinke NOW.۝ A spokesperson for the Interior Department۪s Inspector General Office told Mother Jones it  does not have any plans to investigate the matter ,۝ but would assess a complaint if and when it received one. Late Thursday, Rep.Ra̼l M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), the ranking Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, and Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, sent a pair of letters to the Government Accountability Office and the Interior۪s Inspector General requesting investigations into whether Zinke and other administration officials are advocating for the Republican health care plan. The letters also request a formal determination regarding possible legal violations. Yesterday۪s phone calls by Secretary Zinke occurred shortly after President Trump۪s tweet expressing displeasure with Senator Murkowski, and just one day after DOE Secretary Perry generated concerns of impropriety with an editorial weighing in on the health care debate ,۝Pallone and Grijalva wrote in their letters. The close timing of these actions suggests an apparent pattern and organized effort within the Trump Administration involving the use of federal resources to advance partisan legislation.۝ Grijalva blasted Zinke in a statement earlier Thursday, saying threatening to punish your rivals as political blackmail is something we۪d see from the Kremlin.۝"

The FBI on Monday released early drafts of a statement that former director James Comey later released publicly in July 2016, when he recommended Clinton be exonerated in the probe of her emails as secretary of state. An email chain in the FBI document that begins on May 2 of that year appears to include a redacted draft of the statement, with Comey asking other bureau officials for any comments on this statement.۝ The dates of the email chain in the document suggest Comey had begun drafting his statement days before the investigation closed, about two months before he issued his formal recommendation, and before interviewing Clinton aides. Some Republican members of Congress had accused Comey of prematurely drawing a conclusion before gathering all the facts. Trump on Wednesday agreed wholeheartedly, and called on the Justice Department to investigate. As it has turned out, James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton,۝the president tweeted. He was the best thing that ever happened to her!۝ Trump also implied Comey had already decided to exonerate Clinton before the FBI interviewed her on July 2, 2016. It۪s impossible to tell from the FBI release when Comey made his final decision, as more than 50 pages in the document are blank due to redactions, as was the statement in the email chain. Trump fired Comey in May, as the FBI director was leading an investigation into whether the president۪s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election. Clinton, meanwhile, has blamed her election loss on Comey. He briefly reopened the email investigation after finding more emails in October, just days before the election.

Trump tweeted about Senate Democrats, but failed to comment on The New York Times۪ latest report, which said Don Jr. was informed in advance that the intel he would receive at the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya was actually gathered by the Russian government to help elect his father. Mark Corallo, the spokesman for the president۪s personal lawyer, told The New York Times on Sunday that the president  was not aware of and did not attend the meeting۝ with Veselnitskaya, a move some saw as an early effort to distance the White House from Don Jr., who does not serve in any official capacity in his father۪s administration. He and his brother Eric run the Trump organization . The president has not personally responded to the growing controversy surrounding his son۪s meeting last year with Veselnitskaya and has no public events on his schedule for the second day in a row.Last weekend, the Times reported that the younger Trump met with Veselnitskaya alongside the president۪s son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort to obtain information that would help the campaign against Clinton. Don Jr. hit back at the latest Times report on Tuesday, calling the meeting nonsense.۝ On Monday, the Times revealed that Don Jr. was informed via email ahead of the meeting that the promised intel was linked to the Russian government and its attempts to sway the election in his father۪s favor. U.S. intelligence agencies have all agreed that Russia, under the direction of President Vladimir Putin, actively worked on an influence campaign to help Trump get elected. At the G-20 summit last weekend, Putin denied any involvement in such machinations. Trump has rushed to defend almost any member of his inner circle, at least initially, who was subject to less than stellar media coverage, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn , his daughter Ivanka , his ultra-rich Cabinet officials and his attorney general, Jeff Sessions . Trump۪s decision to let Don Jr. defend himself was a notable departure in his efforts to protect his squadron of trusted confidants. In a statement provided to HuffPost, Don Jr.۪s lawyer, Alan Futerfas, also said the president knew nothing about۝ the meeting, calling it much ado about nothing.۝ Don Jr.۪s takeaway from this communication was that someone had information potentially helpful to the campaign and it was coming from someone he knew,۝ Futerfas said in the statement, which was first provided to The Times. Don Jr. had no knowledge as to what specific information, if any, would be discussed. Further, at no time was there ever any understanding or commitment that he, or anyone else, would find the information, whatever it turned out to be, to be reliable, credible or of interest, or would even survive due diligence. The meeting lasted about 20-30 minutes, and nothing came of it. His father knew nothing about it. The bottom line is that Don, Jr. did nothing wrong.۝ Don Jr. has admitted that he met with Veselnitskaya (in two separate, but differing statements ), but said she was vague, ambiguous and made no sense.۝ He claimed the conversation quickly turned to an obscure American law called the Magnitsky Act ۥ It became clear to me that this was the true agenda all along,۝ he said ۥ before he ended the meeting. The 2012 act allowed the U.S. to withhold visas and freeze Russian assets. In retaliation, the Kremlin halted U.S. adoptions of Russian babies. Legal experts said Monday۪s revelations about Don Jr. knowing that the intel he received from Veselnitskaya actually came from the Russian government were notable. Taking the meeting itself may have been illegal as the U.S. has very specific campaign finance provisions which prohibit contributions from foreign nationals to aid an election."

According to the officials present, Trump۪s advisers, among them the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, were surprised,۝ the NBC piece says. Officials briefly explained the legal and practical impediments to a nuclear buildup and how the current military posture is stronger than it was at the height of the buildup.

North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen,۝ he said in a short statement to reporters at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, before a meeting on the opioid crisis. He has been very threatening, beyond a normal statement,۝ Trump said of the country۪s leader, Kim Jong Un. And as I said, they will be met with fire, fury and frankly, power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.۝ Trump۪s ultimatum, which mirrors North Korea۪s rhetoric toward the United States , came as U.S. intelligence officials reportedly learned that North Korea has produced a miniaturized nuclear warhead that could be placed on a missile , a significant step in advancing its nuclear program. A few hours after Trump۪s news conference, North Korea۪s official KCNA news agency carried a series of statements from military spokesmen responding to the president۪s rhetoric. Using bombastic language typical to KCNA statements, a spokesman claimed that Pyonyang was carefully examining۝ plans to launch missiles at the U.S. island territory of Guam. In a separate post, another North Korean military spokesman warned that war is by no means a game۝ and claimed that U.S. war-thirsty forces are engrossed in war hysteria without discretion.۝ KCNA also published a post titled U.S. Reckless War Frenzy Slammed,۝ in which the propaganda arm blamed Washington for making plans to carry out a pre-emptive strike against North Korea. In recent weeks, the country has also claimed that it successfully tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles, which may be capable of reaching Alaska. U.S. intelligence officials do not know whether North Korea has tested the miniaturized warhead yet, according to NBC News and The Washington Post . On Monday, North Korea issued a similarly strong threat to the U.S. Should the U.S. pounce upon the DPRK with military force at last, the DPRK is ready to teach the U.S. a severe lesson with its strategic nuclear force,۝ foreign minister Ri Yong Ho said in a statement , referring to North Korea. Trump has regularly responded to North Korea۪s nuclear escalation with little specificity, insisting that all options are on the table.۝ He has taken particular issue with China , North Korea۪s only ally, for not doing more to rein in the nuclear program and suggested economic consequences against the country, an important U.S. trade partner. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, criticized Trump۪s rhetoric in an interview with KTAR radio on Tuesday . I take exception to the president۪s comments because you۪ve got to be able to do what you say you۪re going to do,۝ McCain said. In other words, the old walk softly but carry a big stick, Teddy Roosevelt۪s saying, which I think is something that should۪ve applied because all it۪s going to do is bring us closer to a serious confrontation.۝ McCain, however, said he was unsure of whether Trump۪s statement could be interpreted as a threat to North Korea.

The emails contradict White House lawyer Ty Cobb۪s claims that Michael Flynn, Trump۪s former national security adviser, acted independently when he reached out to Russian officials during Trump۪s transition to presidency. Hours after the Obama administration imposed sanctions against Russia for its meddling in the 2016 presidential election, Trump۪s former Deputy National Security Adviser KT McFarland suggested that the transition team would need to strengthen its relationship with Russia, according to email exchanges obtained by or described by unnamed sources to the Times. The sanctions, McFarland noted in the email , appeared to be the outgoing administration۪s attempt to discredit Trump۪s victory in the election and would make it more difficult for the incoming president to improve the U.S.۪s relationship with Russia. If there is a tit-for-tat escalation Trump will have difficulty improving relations with Russia, which has just thrown the U.S.A. election to him,۝ McFarland wrote, according to the Times . As Times reporter Michael S. Schmidt noted in the story and later on Twitter, it۪s not clear if McFarland believed that Russia threw the election in Trump۪s favor, but a White House lawyer told the paper on Friday that she was only saying Democrats were trying to make it appear that way . The leaked emails show how Trump۪s transition team worked to ease relations with Russia after former President Barack Obama attempted to punish the country for reportedly interfering in the U.S. election. These efforts would include Flynn reaching out to Russian ambassador Sergey I. Kislyak to discuss the sanctions hours after they were placed,McFarland wrote in an email, according to the Times. Flynn later resigned from his post in February following revelations that he lied about his conversations with the Russian ambassador . On Friday, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian government, including his conversation with Kislyak about the sanctions.After news of Flynn۪s guilty plea spread, Trump tweeted that he had to fire Flynn because he knew Flynn lied to Vice President Michael Pence and the FBI. On the same day Flynn pleaded guilty, the Associated Press identified McFarland as the unnamed senior official in court papers who is said to have talked to Flynn about what he would say to Russian officials during a discussion on the Obama administration۪s sanctions. Trump has called for friendlier relations with Russia and continuously denies claims that his election campaign colluded with Russia during last year۪s presidential election. Cobbs responded to Flynn۪s guilty plea by saying it implicates no one other than Flynn himself. The false statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year. Nothing about the guilty pleas or the change implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn,۝ he said in an official statement."

A 12-count federal grand jury indictment unsealed shortly after his surrender includes charges of conspiracy against the U.S., conspiracy to launder money, failure to file foreign bank reports and false statements. Manafort and Gates both pleaded not guilty to the charges in federal court. Separately, a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser has pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about Russian dirt۝ he was offered on Hillary Clinton, according to a plea deal prosecutors unsealed Monday.George Papadopoulos, 30,pleaded guilty on Oct. 5 and has been cooperating in the Russia probe. The charges are the first in the probe led by the office of special counsel Robert Mueller , a former FBI director.Monday۪s arrests come three days after news broke that a federal grand jury in Washington had filed charges stemming from Mueller۪s investigation. Manafort and Gates generated tens of millions of dollars in income as a result of their Ukraine work,۝ the indictment says. In order to hide Ukraine payments from United States authorities, from approximately 2006 through at least 2016, Manafort and Gates laundered the money through scores of United States and foreign corporations, partnerships, and bank accounts.۝ Failing to pay taxes allowed Manafort a lavish lifestyle in the United States,۝ according to the indictment, which alleges he spent millions of dollars on luxury goods and services for himself and his extended family through payments wired from offshore nominee accounts to United States vendors.۝ Manafort laundered more than $18 million, which he used to buy property, goods and services in the U.S., the indictment alleges.

Reports have suggested federal investigators could use criminal charges as way to pressure those arrested into providing more information about alleged collusion between President Donald Trump۪s campaign and the Kremlin to influence the election. The indictment charging Manafort and Gates makes no mention of Trump or the election. Trump has aggressively denied allegations that his team colluded with Russia to win the election.

Manafort ran Trump۪s presidential campaign from June 2016 until his resignation in August of that year,after reports surfaced about his past lobbying work for pro-Russian Ukrainian oligarchs. He retroactively registered as a foreign agent and disclosed more than $17 million in payments for his firm۪s consulting work in Ukraine, which occurred before he joined Trump۪s campaign.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-method-madness_us_59e125d7e4b03a7be580b923","WASHINGTON ۥ The conventional wisdom about President Donald Trump is clear enough: He۪s an infantile, ignorant moron surrounded by a shrinking political base, a phalanx of enemies who used to be friends, and more investigators than the FBI Academy. Washington reacts with alarm to his inflammatory tweets, and lately has made a parlor game out of chronicling his outbursts of anger, dismay and ignorance, as news organizations offer a cascade of vivid in-the-room portrayals of an out-of-control boy king. Democrats hope against hope that he will be impeached over Russia. His approval rating is lower at this point in his term than any previous modern president۪s. His former consigliere Steve Bannon has reportedly said Trump has only a 30 percent chance of lasting a full term. But by the end of this week, it was clearer than ever that if Trump is a moron, he is a moron on a mission ۥ and with more method to his madness than his enemies understand or want to consider. The tweets are a useful distraction ۥ a kind of air cover for his carpet bombing of federal policy and programs. In quick succession, the president and his small but focused dead-end gang have used administrative diktats to wreak havoc on clean air rules, immigration procedures, Obamacare and the Iran deal. Each of these moves ۥ whether designed to serve the interests of big business, Tea Party xenophobes or the new Sunni-neocon alliance ۥ is unpopular . Trump doesn۪t seem to mind. He knows what he wants. Outraged critics immediately turned to Congress and the courts for help, but it isn۪t clear whether they will get it. Republican majorities in Congress are fairly thin, but they۪re probably big enough to prevent legislative reversals of these and other Trump moves. On Iran, for example, Trump۪s newest GOP enemy, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), is working on a measure that includes some features of the president۪s new, harsher approach, and Corker was opposed to the Iran deal when it was approved initially. The president۪s foes are going to court ۥ or have already gone to court ۥ over his attacks on Obama-era immigration, clean air and Affordable Care Act measures. But the critics face two potential problems. First, many of the Obama-era rules are based on administrative actions, and are not armored by having been enacted by Congress and signed into law. That makes Trump۪s own use of the bureaucracy, and his contempt for proper administrative procedure,somewhat easier to defend for anyone inclined to do so. Second, Trump is fast filling vacancies in federal courts that will review these and other actions. He is doing so at a speedier clip than his predecessors. Names are fed to the White House in assembly-line fashion by Leonard Leo, the leader of the conservative Federalist Society and one of the least-known most powerful people in D.C. The Senate is only in GOP hands by a margin of 52 of 48. But it۪s rare for a Republican to waste a confrontation with Trump over a judicial nominee. And Democrats۪ efforts to delay or kill the president۪s picks are at risk of being undercut further by the Republican leadership. After having been repeatedly humiliated in public and private by Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) now says he personally favors getting rid of a custom that allows any senator, even one in the minority, to scotch a nominee from his or her own state. By the time challenges to ACA, the Environmental Protection Agency and other rules reach trial, the complexion of the court may well have changed in Trump۪s favor. Do Trump۪s moves jeopardize the GOP۪s control of the House or Senate (or both)? Maybe ۥ especially when it comes to health care, where premiums may rise and Democrats can blame it on Republicans and the president. But does he care? Not clear. He۪s already at war with his own party, and his renegade buddy Bannon is preparing the ground for the next stage of the nihilistic anti-everything revolution. If the Democrats take control of Congress, there will at least be some partisan consistency in Trump۪s attacks on it. Just because Trump tweets furiously and seems easily distracted doesn۪t mean that he and the die-hards around him ۥ like Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, speechwriter/foreign policy agitator Stephen Miller and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt ۥ aren۪t playing a long game. One of the top minds on the mainstream left predicted confidently to me ۥ and somewhat dismissively ۥ that Trump would not seek a second term, should he not be impeached and convicted. Maybe. But Trump۪s father, who belittled him while repeatedly demanding that he grow up to be a killer۝ and a king,۝ died at the age of 93.Donald will be 74 in 2020. And he already thinks he is a king."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-mcconnell-criticism_us_598b54c8e4b0a66b8bb0aa01","President Donald Trump on Thursday lashed out at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) over Republicans۪ latest failed attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. He also implored the Kentucky lawmaker to get back to work۝ and pass legislation on tax reform and infrastructure spending. Trump۪s comments echoed similar ones he۪d made the day before, rebuking McConnell۪s claim that the president had been overly optimistic about health care reform. Senator Mitch McConnell said I had excessive expectations,۪ but I don۪t think so,۝ Trump tweeted on Wednesday. After 7 years of hearing Repeal & Replace, why not done?۝ McConnell had accused Trump of having excessive expectations۝ for legislative progress during remarks to a Rotary Club in Kentucky on Monday. Part of the reason I think that the storyline is that [lawmakers] haven۪t done much is because, in part, the president and others have set these early timelines about things need to be done by a certain point,۝ he said. McConnell hinted that Trump۪s insistence on haste had made Congress۪ failure to repeal the ACA, also known as Obamacare, look more damning than it actually was. Our new president, of course, has not been in this line of work before,۝ McConnell said Monday. And I think he had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process.۝ Taking McConnell to the woodshed on social media apparently wasn۪t Trump۪s first move. Prior to the tweet۪s posting, Trump phoned McConnell to complain about the senator۪s remarks, The New York Times reported. Trump also reportedly vowed to continue calling for a repeal of Obamacare and urged McConnell to do so as well. Trump had certainly projected optimism about the prospects of repeal well before there was any real chance of it. In February, he claimed repeal was on track to succeed by the middle of March . It went on to fail in the House in March, before passing in a revised form in May. The president rarely lets criticism go unanswered. Trump۪s social media director Dan Scavino lambasted McConnell on Twitter earlier on Wednesday for offering more excuses.۝ Trump has issued stinging indictments of trusted allies in the past, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions , his first supporter in the Senate. But this is his first public spat with McConnell, the steely tactician responsible for shepherding the remainder of Trump۪s legislative agenda through the notoriously tricky Senate. In a nod to McConnell on Tuesday, Trump endorsed McConnell۪s preferred candidate in the Republican Alabama Senate primary:Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.), who has been occupying the seat vacated by Sessions earlier this year. It is unclear how a chill in relations between Trump and McConnell might affect the GOP agenda. Trump is pushing a bill introduced by Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and David Perdue (R-Ga.) that would dramatically reduce legal immigration . He also has ambitious plans to overhaul the tax code and pass a budget with deep spending cuts. McConnell indeed presided over the narrow defeat of the so-called skinny۝ Obamacare repeal bill at the end of July. McConnell appeared to be as blindsided and disappointed in the result ۥ made possible by Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and John McCain (Ariz.) breaking with their fellow Republicans ۥ as Trump was. The bill۪s collapse signaled the end of efforts to repeal Obamacare for the foreseeable future."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-strategy-charlottesville_us_5994b068e4b06ef724d61291","WASHINGTON  Let۪s be clear about what President Donald Trump was up to Tuesday during his press conference in Trump Tower , and what his longer-range plan is for surviving, if not prospering, in the White House for at least four years. Speaking publicly in the family fortress in the wake of the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, he wasn۪t trying to convince anyone of the facts. There could be no dispute about them if you saw, say, the Vice video of hideous neo-Nazis, KKK members, generic white supremacists and rancid anti-Semites in the streets carrying torches and chanting Jews will not replace us.۝ No, the president was doing something else: trolling the media, deliberately goading reporters he knew were waiting for him in his echoing marble lobby. He basked in their urgent outrage and determined focus on Charlottesville. He had scripted himself as the alt-right۪s Daniel in a fake news۝ lion۪s den of his own devising. Was he upset by the resulting headline and denunciations from the likes of the former presidents Bush, father and son ? Hardly. He had sought them. In fact, word on Wednesday was that Trump had been in a good, almost celebratory, mood Tuesday after the confrontation he۪d created. He had unleashed himself, perhaps once and for all. He was in the fight, and the fight is all. More broadly and big-picture, look for more of the same. Having risen to power by dividing the country, his party leadership and even, at times, his own campaign team, his aim now is to divide or discredit any institution, tradition or group in his way. Donald Trump seems perfectly willing to destroy the country to maintain his own power. He is racing to undermine the federal political system  if not all American public life  before still-independent forces (for now, the federal courts, the press and Congress) undermine him .  The goal, as always with Trump, is to win amid the chaos he sows, to be the last man standing in rubble. And winning۝ is rapidly being reduced to the raw, basic terms he prefers: brute survival. With a record-setting low approval rating, world crises everywhere and a special counsel on his tail, the main victory he can hope for is staying in office. It۪s not only an emotional imperative for Trump, it۪s a deliberate ۥ and thus far successful ۥ strategy. I am told by lawyers familiar with special counsel Robert Mueller۪s methods and those of similar investigations that Mueller almost certainly obtained the president۪s federal tax returns long ago. Whether Trump knows that directly or not, he has to assume it  and be driven wild by it. The counsel also has assembled an industrial-strength team of experts in international money-laundering, criminal tax fraud and forensic accounting. So the survival urge is more urgent. How does he do it? Here is some of what۪s ahead: More white-right protests Trump doesn۪t plan them (unless you consider his own rallies), but he also may not mind seeing more of them take place. He certainly hasn۪t called for any group to cease and desist. San Francisco is next , with the Patriot Prayer group leading the way. Those who worry about the coming SF event note that it is scheduled for a park controlled by the National Park Service. Focus on anti-Trump protesters Trump avoided Vietnam with a medical deferment, which is perhaps why he now sees glamour in being The Leader Under Siege. Federal prosecutors have obliged this storyline by issuing sweeping subpoenas for the internet records of possible demonstrators at his inauguration. Focus on voter fraud۪ This isn۪t a substantial problem, but it is a substantial opportunity for Trump not only to try to limit Democrat-leaning votes but also to force Democrats to spend extra time and messaging on the cause of minority rights. When he says they۝ about the Democrats, he wants his own base to see what he means. Goad the press In his first tweet on Wednesday , Trump took aim at Amazon , which is owned by Jeff Bezos, also the owner of The Washington Post. The president accused the site of doing great damage۝ to main-street retailers. But regulatory or tax threats aside, Trump will continue to troll the news pages and airwaves of the Post and other major outlets, knowing that the more righteous indignation they show, the less his hard-core base will believe them. Muscle witnesses Paul Manafort, Trump۪s former campaign chairman, denied in a filing that he was cooperating۝ with Hill investigators who are looking into whether the campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election. The message was meant for Trump. Manafort, who had extensive dealings with Vladimir Putin allies in Ukraine, didn۪t want his vindictive (former) boss to think that he۪d flipped۝ to the other side. But the president۪s allies sent a message back just in case. The National Enquirer, with close ties to Trump, recently published a long piece claiming that Manafort had had a sick affair۝ with a younger woman and had somehow been betraying his country.۝ Stack the courts This is far from the headlines, but it۪s critical, and it influences the places in which the Trump administration۪s attempts to dismantle the regulatory state, civil rights laws and voting rights will literally be judged. It is also where Mueller will ask for any prosecutions of those in the Trump circle. And unlike most of the rest of the Trump administration, where disorganization and understaffing are the rule, the judge-picking process has largely been left to the Federalist Society, which is efficient in the extreme. As of now, Democrat-nominated judges still predominate, but in another year or two Trump could well have created a firewall for himself in most circuits. Drain Obamacare Even many Republicans want to infuse emergency cash into strapped health care markets; that is, to shore up Obamacare unless and until it is killed off. But Trump will favor benign neglect at the most, and not just because he wants Obamacare to fail.۝ The program۪s problems offer the added political benefit of dividing the Democrats on a key issue. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and company are now making support for a single-payer,۝ Medicare-for-all system a litmus test for candidates . But it is a test that other liberal Democrats warn is divisive and unrealistic. Music to Trump۪s ears. Thirty-four Trump must keep the allegiance of this many Republican senators to defeat any attempt to convict him in an impeachment trial in the Senate, if there ever is one. You can be sure he knows this number, and that much of his strategy is made with it in mind. He۪d rather have a small number of hard-core locked and loaded۝ supporters than a larger number of unreliable moderates; it۪s the impeachment version of his 2016 Electoral College strategy. Trump evidently regards Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell , the GOP Senate leader, as too weak to be reliable. But the president had better think twice about trying to have him replaced. The Louisville-based senator is friends with a politician from across the Ohio River named Mike Pence."
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jared-kushner-security-clearance_us_596783aae4b0a0c6f1e67433","WASHINGTON ۥ House Republicans voted Thursday to block an effort aimed at revoking the security clearance of White House senior adviser Jared Kushner . Several members of Congress have questioned the appropriateness of Kushner maintaining a security clearance following bombshell reports that he met with a Kremlin-linked lawyer who promised incriminating information about 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton during last year۪s campaign. The president۪s son-in-law failed to disclose the meeting, as well as several other meetings with Russian officials, on the security clearance form he submitted before the Trump administration took office. Knowingly omitting such information is a crime. Kushner۪s lawyers, however, maintain the omissions were an error and have amended the form. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), who chaired the Democratic National Committee during much of last year۪s campaign cycle, proposed an amendment targeting Kushner during a House Appropriations Committee markup session Thursday. It was voted down, 22-30, along party lines. The measure would have barred the government from issuing or maintaining a security clearance for any White House individual under a criminal investigation by a Federal law enforcement agency for aiding a foreign government.۝ Wasserman Schultz also attempted to introduce an amendment that would bar the government from issuing or maintaining a security clearance for White House staff who deliberately fail۝ to disclose meetings with foreign nationals. It was voted down by the same margin. In addition to the revelations from the past week, The New York Times reported in May that federal and congressional investigators are looking into a December meeting between Kushner and a Russian banker with ties to Russian intelligence. McClatchy also reported this week that investigators in Congress and the Justice Department are looking into whether the Trump campaign۪s digital team, which was led by Kushner,directed Russian operatives to key U.S. states. This amendment is an important step in protecting the American people from the threat of hostile foreign interference. That is not a controversial or a political goal,۝ Wasserman Schultz said during the hearing. Revoking Jared Kushner۪s security clearance would send a clear signal to anyone who would consider aiding and abetting a foreign enemy state to affect the outcome of a U.S. presidential election that they will not be entrusted with our nation۪s most sensitive information,۝ she added. Republicans called the move a stunt, arguing that it is unnecessary and unproductive under current federal regulations. This is already the law,۝ Rep. John Culberson (R-Texas) said. The use of funding prohibitions to deny or remove security clearances is simply a political stunt and utterly unnecessary because security clearances can already be revoked because of criminal conduct.۝ Reports of Kushner۪s failure to disclose meetings with Russian officials also drew the ire of Democrats in the Senate this week. There is a crisis of trust that the White House has to deal with,۝ Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said Wednesday, adding that Kushner ought to resign ."
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mueller-jared-kushner-flynn_us_5a21889ae4b03350e0b6773f","President Donald Trump ۪s former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Sergei Kislyak , the former Russian ambassador to the U.S.One of the alleged falsehoods that led to Flynn۪s indictment appears to implicate Trump۪s own son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner . Court filings and multiple reports hint at an elaborate, multinational effort led by Flynn and Kushner to undermine then-President Barack Obama at the behest of then-President-elect Trump. In December 2016,the United Nations Security Council was nearing a vote on a resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Jerusalem.The Obama administration, then in its last full month in office, had decided not to veto the resolution, a landmark shift in U.S. policy toward Israel. Trump, weeks away from assuming the presidency, publicly urged Obama to veto the resolution. It now appears that, behind the scenes, members of Trump۪s transition team may have pressured other countries to delay the vote until Trump took office. Such coordination could be a violation of the Logan Act, a federal law passed in 1799 that forbids unauthorized citizens from negotiating with foreign governments. Flynn said a very senior member of the Presidential Transition Team۝ directed him to call officials from foreign governments in an attempt to block the vote, according to court records. Sources told several news outlets that Kushner is that senior official . Jared called Flynn and told him, you need to get on the phone to every member of the Security Council and tell them to delay the vote,۝a Trump transition official who was in the room with Flynn at the time of the call told BuzzFeed ,adding that Kushner described the issue as a top priority for the president.۝ Mueller reportedly questioned Kushner about Flynn behind closed doors in November. Kushner۪s alleged direction to interfere with the vote is a major development as Mueller۪s investigators close in on members of the president۪s inner circle. The New York Times also reported Friday that Mueller۪s investigators have learned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked Trump۪s transition team to lobby other nations to back Israel , citing two people briefed on the inquiry. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Mueller۪s team was examining Kushner۪s contacts with foreign leaders."

Trump endorsed Moore earlier this month in spite of a mounting list of sexual harassment and assault allegations against the candidate, including child molestation.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-party-congress-senate-alabama_us_5a2d3a0ee4b0a290f0517742","Narrow wins in special elections don۪t typically qualify as major political events, but Tuesday night۪s Senate race in Alabama , in which Democrat Doug Jones is the apparent winner, may be the exception. The last time Alabama sent a Democrat to the Senate was 1992, when it elected Richard Shelby, who later switched parties to become a Republican. Jones isn۪t switching parties. He looks like a bona fide Democrat, if a relatively moderate one by national standards. That alone makes the election result newsworthy, especially since strong turnout by African-American voters ۥ in a state famously hostile to those voters ۥ arguably made Jones the winner. But Tuesday۪s result will have a profound, near-immediate effect on how Washington operates for the very simple reason that a shift in this one seat dramatically alters the makeup of the Senate ۥ making it more difficult for the GOP to pass the kind of radical agenda its leaders have in mind. More broadly, it sends a message that the usual rules of politics still apply: that the more Republicans defy public opinion, the more likely they are to suffer electoral consequences. For the last year, Republican strategy on major legislation, like their tax cut and repeal of the Affordable Care Act , has been to pass bills through using budget reconciliation rules. That۪s the special, expedited process in which senators can۪t filibuster, so a simple majority will suffice. Right now, Republicans have 52 seats, which means they can afford to lose only two seats on such proposals. (In case of a 50-50 tie, Vice President Mike Pence can break the tie in Republicans۪ favor.) When Jones takes his seat, that GOP majority shrinks to 51, which means Republicans will be able to lose just one GOP vote if all Democrats vote against them. The GOP۪s margin for error just shrunk by half. That۪s a pretty big deal. As it was, GOP leaders in the Senate couldn۪t hold enough seats to pass Obamacare repeal. The closest they came was on repeal legislation in July , when they lost three of their own ۥ Susan Collins of Maine, John McCain of Arizona and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Some Republicans are hoping to revisit repeal next year, figuring they could flip one of those three to yes. Now, with Jones and the diminished GOP majority, they۪d have to flip at least two of them. That۪s a lot more difficult, especially since none of those three have shown any sign of wavering on their core commitment to preserve the program۪s Medicaid expansion and protections for people with pre-existing conditions. As for the major legislation under discussion right now, the GOP tax cut, its prospects look better. Although it۪s not totally out of the question that the effort could stall , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said the party will vote on the proposal before Jones takes his seat. Even Collins is voting yes, although she۪s counting on Republicans also passing a series of side measures to keep the health care system stable ۥ and it۪s not clear House Republicans are willing to do that. But whatever happens for the tax cut, the prospects for passing similarly sweeping legislation afterward, once Jones is in the Senate, are slim ۥ at least unless Republicans decide to abandon their strategy of passing legislation with party-line votes and try actual bipartisanship. Of course, even with a suddenly diminished Senate majority, Republicans will still be able to enact an agenda, mostly because of President Donald Trump ۪s ability to shape policy through appointments and regulations. As HuffPost۪s S.V. Date notes, there۪s zero reason to think Tuesday۪s result will change Trump۪s behavior, because nothing changes his behavior. He is happy to defy political gravity and take his chances. But together with the results of November۪s Virginia gubernatorial election, in which another Trump-backed Republican suffered an even more crushing defeat, Tuesday۪s results are proof that political gravity still exists ۥ that despite all the built-in advantages Republicans have, from thinly veiled suppression of African-American votes across the South to a conservative echo chamber that perpetuates the most unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, the voters still get their say. The Alabama race had a lot to do with the idiosyncrasies of the campaign and the Republican candidate, Judge Roy Moore . But it also had to do with the GOP brand, which is hugely unpopular, and the way Trump is governing.One of the most remarkable results Tuesday was exit polling that showed Alabama voters split down the middle, 48 percent to 48 percent, on whether they approved of Trump۪s performance in office. That۪s quite a statement from voters in a state that voted overwhelmingly for Trump just a little more than a year ago. If that sentiment persists, it could mean major Democratic gains in the 2018 November midterms. Forecasters already thought control of the House was in play but were more dubious about Democratic prospects in the Senate, largely because only two Republican seats ۥ one in Arizona and one in Nevada ۥ seemed vulnerable. But now that Alabama۪s seat has flipped, Democrats could seize control by winning those two vulnerable seats while holding on to the ones they are defending. In the meantime, assuming the Tuesday results hold up, Republicans are going to find legislating even harder than they have so far ۥ and it۪s not like they۪ve gotten much done already. Correction: The original version of this article said that Shelby last ran and won as a Democrat in 1986. It was 1992."

We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence,۝ Trump said in an impromptu statement on Monday after returning to the White House from his golf club in New Jersey. Racism is evil, and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, Neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans,۝ he added. Trump had come under widespread criticism for not immediately denouncing the far-right groups , instead blaming many sides۝ for Saturday۪s mayhem . On Sunday, White House officials clarified that Trump was referring toʉwhite supremacists, KKK, Neo-Nazi and all extremist groups,۝ in his previous remark, but the statement notably did not come from the president himself and was attributed to an unnamed spokesperson. Other members of the Trump administration, including Vice President Mike Pence, attempted to clarify Trump۪s Saturday statement by claiming that he meant to condemn extremist groups.

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-health-bill-insurers-unworkable_us_59697eb7e4b0d6341fe9111c","Two organizations representing the U.S. health insurance industry just called a new provision of the Senate Republicans۪ health care proposal simply unworkable in any form۝ and warned that it would cause major hardship, especially for middle-class people with serious medical problems. The organizations, America۪s Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, speak for the businesses that would be responsible for making the new system work ۥ or at least attempting to do so. That may help explain why, with a vote on the bill planned for next week, they are letting loose with what, by Washington lobbying standards, sounds like a primal scream. In a publicly posted letter to Senate leaders , the two groups focused their attention on an amendment that would undermine the Affordable Care Act ۪s protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The amendment, crafted by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), would allow insurers to resume sales of policies that leave out key benefits, such as prescription drugs or mental health. More important, it would allow insurers to discriminate among customers based on medical status, charging higher premiums or denying policies altogether to people with existing medical problems ۥ from the severe, like cancer, to the relatively mild, like allergies. The Affordable Care Act prohibited those practices, forcing insurers to sell policies with comprehensive benefits and at uniform prices to everybody, no matter their medical status. This made coverage available to people who couldn۪t get it before, but it also forced insurers to raise underlying insurance premiums, because it meant they had to cover medical bills they had previously been able to dodge. The Affordable Care Act also has tax credits that offset these higher premiums, but they are based on income, and not everybody qualifies ۥ leaving many people, particularly in the middle- and upper-middle-class, paying a lot more for coverage. R epublicans have seized on these high premiums as one of the big flaws in Obamacare, promising that, if given the chance to repeal the law, they would eliminate the costly mandates۝ driving them. But, tellingly, Republicans almost never speak explicitly about getting rid of pre-existing condition protections. Over the years, even as they were coming up with plans to weaken or eliminate the new insurance rules, they would promise publicly to keep those protections for pre-existing conditions in place. As recently as Friday, during an address to the nation۪s governors, Vice President Mike Pence said the legislation ensures that every American with preexisting conditions has access to the coverage and care they need ۥ no exceptions.۝ Cruz has attempted to maintain the same illusion, describing his amendment as the best of both worlds because it would still require insurers to offer some policies that conform to the existing rules ۥ that is, with all of the Affordable Care Act۪s essential benefits and available to all people at uniform prices. On Friday, the insurer groups explained why that couldn۪t work: A s healthy people move to the less-regulated plans, those with significant medical needs will have no choice but to stay in the comprehensive plans, and premiums will skyrocket for people with preexisting conditions.۝ Subsidies would still shield some from the increases,but they would generally be smaller than the subsides under the Affordable Care Act and would be available to fewer people. For people who didn۪t qualify for assistanceʉۥ because their incomes exceeded 350 percent of the poverty line, or $86,100 for a family of four in 2017 ۥ the prices would become unaffordable, the insurer groups explained. Cruz and his allies have said the amendment contains provisions designed to make it viable ۥ including a $70 billion stability۝ fund to help insurers keep premiums in the regulated plans from getting too high. In the letter, the insurers said, We also firmly believe dedicated funding included in the bill to address the cost of plans that cover people with pre-existing medical conditions is insufficient and additional funding will not make the provision workable for consumers or taxpayers.۝ The insurers noted that a key element in any market-based coverage system is risk adjustment۝ ۥ basically, an arrangement in which insurers that end up with more healthy beneficiaries relinquish some of their income, while those with less healthy beneficiaries get an injection of funds. But risk adjustment can only work when there are uniform benefit requirements across the market,۝ the insurers warned ۥ and, under the Cruz proposal, benefits would vary wildly in the unregulated part of the market. Millions of more individuals will become uninsured,۝ the insurer organizations said, concluding that we strongly oppose this provision.۝ The substance of the warnings was not new. Ever since Cruz began discussing his proposal, and especially since it became apparent that Senate GOP leaders intended to add it to their bill, a chorus of independent experts, industry officials and trade groups has criticized it and warned of its potential effects. Among those weighing in recently were the American Academy of Actuaries , who released a report Friday that even included illustrations to explain how insurance is supposed to work ۥ and what would happen if healthy and sick people gravitated to different sets of plans. That report did not mention the Cruz proposal by name, but it made the same points ۥ stating, among other things, that, in a market with separate risk pools for compliant and noncompliant coverage, costs would no longer be spread over the broad enrollee population.۝ But Friday night۪s blast from the insurer groups is noteworthy because AHIP, in particular,has a relatively conservative outlook and tends to have close relationships with Republicans. Among health care groups weighing in on repeal proposals over the last few months, insurers have been among the more reserved ۥ generally offering a nuanced mix of support and criticism. That changed Friday, just in time for a weekend when a handful of holdout Republicans have said they will study the bill and consider how to vote on it. Two Republican senators,Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky, have already said they oppose it ۥ and would not vote yes on a so-called motion to proceed, which is necessary to begin formal debate and, eventually, have a vote on the bill. If one more Republican joins them, GOP leaders won۪t have the 50 votes necessary to pass the motion, thereby halting the process and quite possibly killing the bill."

In an afternoon press conference, Trump said that over the weekend, he wrote letters to the families of the four service members, who died in the deadliest U.S. combat operation of Trump۪s term thus far.The letters, Trump said,either have been sent already or will be sent Monday night. He also said he intends to call the families. Trump then took a moment to compare himself favorably to former presidents, saying he likes to call families when I۪m able to do it.۝ The traditional way, if you look at President Obama and other presidents ۥ most of them didn۪t make calls.A lot of them didn۪t make calls.I like to call when it۪s appropriate, when I think I۪m able to do it,۝ Trump said. They have made the ultimate sacrifice, so generally I would say that I like to call. I۪m going to be calling them. I want a little time to pass.۝ Other presidents have also gone beyond writing letters. Ari Fleischer, who served as spokesman for President George W. Bush ۥ who launched the United States into the Iraq and Afghanistan wars ۥ said Bush frequently went out of his way to interact with the military community. I know he wrote to the families and I often was with him when he met with families at military bases to commiserate in person,۝ Fleischer said. Toward the end of Bush۪s presidency, The Washington Times reported that Bush  met privately with more than 500 families of troops killed in action and with more than 950 wounded veterans,۝often during private sessions. President Barack Obama , meanwhile,made a late-night visit to an Air Force base in Dover, Delaware, in 2009 to receive the bodies of several soldiers who were killed in action . President Trump۪s claim is wrong,۝ an Obama spokesman told HuffPost Monday. President Obama engaged families of the fallen and wounded warriors throughout his presidency through calls, letters, visits to Section 60 at Arlington, visits to Walter Reed, visits to Dover, and regular meetings with Gold Star Families at the White House and across the country.۝ Other former aides to Obama called out Trump for his comments Monday. Later in the press conference, a reporter pressed Trump on his claim about Obama. Trump backtracked a bit, saying: I don۪t know if he did. I was told that he didn۪t often. And a lot of presidents don۪t.۝ President Obama, I think, probably did sometimes. Maybe sometimes he didn۪t. I don۪t know. That۪s what I was told. All I can do is ask my generals,۝ he added. Other presidents did not call. They۪d write letters. Some presidents didn۪t do anything. But I like the combination.When I can, I like the combination of a call and also a letter.۝ Trump didn۪t then specify which presidents supposedly never called service members۪ families. Before he was president, Trump circulated conspiracy theories about Obama supposedly failing to personally reach out to the families of fallen troops. In August 2012, he tweeted an accusation that Obama didn۪t actually sign some condolence letters himself because he was too busy playing golf.۝ Trump was actually playing golf on Oct. 7 , the day one of the soldiers۪ bodies was returned to Dover Air Force Base after the Islamic State ambush in Niger.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roy-moore-trump-accusers_us_5a0b63d0e4b0bc648a0e8541","WASHINGTON ۥ Senate Republicans are increasingly lining up behind the women accusing Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore (R) of sexual misconduct, saying he shouldn۪t be able to serve given the disturbing allegations against him. The women who have come forward are entirely credible,۝ Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) declared Tuesday. He۪s obviously not fit to be in the United States Senate.۝ But ask those Republicans if they believe the women who accused President Donald Trump of sexual assault, and the conversation is over. Look, we۪re talking about the situation in Alabama,۝ McConnell told HuffPost, when asked about Trump۪s accusers. I۪d be happy to address that if there are any further questions.۝ Moore۪s scandal has put his party in an incredibly uncomfortable predicament: the more Republicans say the allegations by five women against Moore are proof that he doesn۪t belong in the Senate, the more hypocritical they look for ignoring the 16 women who have accused Trump of sexual assault and helping him become president. The White House position on the president۪s accusers is that they are all liars . Trump denied all of the allegations again last month, calling them fake news۝ and made-up stuff.۝ So why do Republicans believe Moore۪s accusers but not Trump۪s? HuffPost spent Tuesday asking GOP senators why the situations are different. Few could offer a convincing argument, instead opting to shrug their shoulders, pivot or abruptly walk away. Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kansas) said Moore should step aside۝ because the women accusing him of misconduct appear to have the preponderance of the evidence.۝ Asked if he believes Trump۪s accusers, Roberts replied, I don۪t know them.۝ He started to leave but turned back and said, referring to Moore۪s accusers, I don۪t know the others, either.۝ Perhaps realizing his answers made no sense, Roberts turned back again and said with a smile, Or [Bill] Clinton.۝ Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) said Moore۪s accusers certainly seem credible.۝ He had a harder time responding to the allegations against Trump. You۪re obviously asking what everybody۪s asking. You know, what about all these other folks,۝ said Cassidy, before taking a lengthy pause. You know, I don۪t know. Without going into [Bill] Clinton, or Trump, or anyone else, I۪ll just stay with where I am with Roy Moore.۝ Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) argued that the sheer volume and the level of detail that۪s been provided۝ by Moore۪s accusers draws enough conclusion۝ for him to say the Alabama Republican ought to withdraw from the race. As for whether Trump۪s accusers should be believed, Burr said he was only addressing Roy Moore.۝ It۪s no secret that Republicans don۪t want Moore in their ranks, and it۪s not just because of the latest allegations against him. He thinks homosexuality should be illegal and compared it to bestiality . He fueled conspiracies about former President Barack Obama being born in Kenya. As chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, Moore was expelled from office ۥ twice ۥ for defying the U.S. Supreme Court۪s ruling on marriage equality and for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments statue from the courthouse. Perhaps most unnerving to Republicans, though, is that Moore has Steve Bannon۪s support . Bannon, a former top aide to Trump and executive chairman of the conservative website Breitbart, is on a mission to dismantle the political establishment in Washington and sees Moore۪s candidacy as a way to do it. He۪s vowed to use his website۪s platform to try to unseat Republican incumbents in 2018 and wants McConnell out as majority leader. That۪s arguably the biggest factor in Republicans siding with Moore۪s accusers. GOP leaders are so desperate to keep Moore out, they۪re exploring the idea of a last-minute write-in campaign for another Republican candidate, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions , who previously held the seat. Moore۪s name, however, will still appear on the ballot as required by Alabama law ۥ prompting some Republicans to call for a vote to expel him if he wins the Dec. 12 special election. We۪ve looked at all the options,۝ McConnell said Tuesday. For now, Republicans insist that Moore۪s accusers are enough proof that he doesn۪t belong in the Senate ۥ even if they can۪t explain why they don۪t see Trump۪s accusers as just as credible. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) said he believes the women accusing Moore of sexual misconduct but threw his hands in the air when asked about Trump۪s accusers. I don۪t think in this particular case that there was a lot of disagreement among those individuals, so ...۝ he said, trailing off. Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), one of four senators who endorsed Moore۪s campaign, walked away without saying anything when asked if Trump۪s accusers deserve the same benefit of the doubt as the women who accused Moore of sexual assault. I۪m working on taxes right now and concentrating on that and heading to a meeting where I have to speak and that۪s what I۪m concentrating on,۝ Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) told HuffPost, walking quickly down a Senate hallway. Asked if he has any thoughts at all on the Moore scandal, he replied, My thoughts are on taxes. If you want to talk about taxes.۝ OK. Do you want to tax Roy Moore?۝ asked HuffPost. Enzi said nothing and walked away."

I know it۪s a hard storm to recover from,۝ Duke told reporters outside the White House. But I know it is really a good news story in terms of our ability to reach people and the limited number of deaths that have taken place in such a devastating hurricane.۝ But the situation continues to be dire as people in need await aid deliveries,said Cruz, who was shocked and appalled by Duke۪s statement.

Where is there good news here?۝ It۪s been more than a week since Maria ripped through Puerto Rico as a powerful Category 5 hurricane ۥ the strongest storm to hit the island in over 80 years.There have been at least 16 Maria-related deaths on Puerto Rico, though experts said they expect the death toll to rise as recovery efforts continue. President Donald Trump has come under fire over his response to the disaster. He tweeted over a dozen times last weekend about the NFL, yet didn۪t mention Puerto Rico once on the social media platform during that time. The president pushed back against claims from lawmakers who suggested he ought to spend more time focused on disaster relief and less on the football players protesting during the national anthem. I have plenty of time on my hands,۝ Trump said Tuesday during a news conference when asked if he was too distracted by the NFL to focus on Puerto Rico.  All I do is work .۝ The seemingly contradictory statements were followed up Friday with tweets, in which the president quoted Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello۪s statement about the federal government۪s relief efforts. Cruz isn۪t buying it though. She made another desperate appeal to Trump on Friday, asking him to step up the response efforts and figure out a way to deliver much-needed aid to struggling Puerto Ricans, despite logistical issues. Thank you for calling San Juan yesterday and listening for our May Day call,۝ said Cruz, speaking directly to Trump through CNN. There are 77 other towns that are waiting anxiously and will be very grateful to you and to the American people if you continue to step up to the moral imperative that you have taken on all over the world to help those in need.۝ So help us,۝ she continued. I know he can do it because he did it yesterday with San Juan. Somebody heard me. They just came to San Juan and things started moving and rolling. But this has to happen on a continuous basis for the entire island of Puerto Rico.۝ Let۪s get it done. ...

During the daily White House press briefing,Miller expanded on a new Senate bill pertaining to immigration reform that would favor English-speaking applicants. CNN۪s Jim Acosta questioned Miller about whether that bill is keeping with American tradition۝ and cited the most famous portion of The New Colossus۝: Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.۝ Miller brushed off Acosta۪s reference, arguing that the poem written by Emma Lazarus was added later۝ and has no significance. I don۪t want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of liberty and lighting in the world; it۪s a symbol of American liberty lighting the world. The poem that you۪re referring to was added later. It۪s not actually part of the Statue of Liberty,۝ Miller argued. It۪s true that The New Colossus,۝ which was never intended to be a statement of political policy, was added to the Statue of Liberty in 1903 and that the statue itself was dedicated in 1886. But they are widely associated with each other: The poem was written to help raise funds for the statue۪s pedestal and is currently featured on a bronze tablet in the museum in the base of the Statue of Liberty. Sections of the National Park Service۪s website about the statue are devoted to the poem and Lazarus. The poem was often cited earlier this year as Trump tried to ban people from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. During a rally against the travel ban, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the poem a statement of values of our country.۝ It۪s a recognition that the strength of our country is in our diversity, that the revitalization constantly of America comes from our immigrant population,۝ she said .

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-tax-plan-rich_us_59cd6a14e4b05f005d3328cb","Most Americans suffer from the unfortunate delusion that economic problems are violations of some mathematical order. When recession, severe inflation or other hard times engulf society, it is because the sacred equations have been angered. If we adjust the right variable just so, a set of very important numbers will respond appropriately, and a process of mystical, self-sustaining prosperity will begin. Knowledge of these secret statistical potions is closely guarded, and its practitioners deploy sophisticated abstractions to explain away common-sense calls for reform. Why do so many people work 60-hour weeks for poverty wages while a few luxuriate in the fabulous returns of interest-bearing assets? Why are the citizens of Puerto Rico threatened by a deadly social collapse while the fruit of the island۪s labor is shipped to Wall Street bondholders? The answer surely cannot be that some wealthy members of our society are exercising political power over the lives and incomes of others. We must consider growth, productivity, liquidity, gross domestic product and the debt-to-GDP ratio. But at the heart of every important economic issue are simple and straightforward power relationships. When you are in debt, someone else has financial power over the ordering of your affairs. Wealth enables rich people to buy their way out of troubles that overwhelm the lives of the poor. For much of our history, the American government granted some people the right to own other people. Economic problems are political problems. They have always been so; they can never be otherwise. And so in a perverse sense, President Donald Trump۪s most recent tax proposal is a great gift to society. It clears away much of the obfuscating hocus-pocus that leaders of both political parties have been busy constructing around our politics over the past 40 years. Trump wants a massive tax cut for the very wealthy. He doesn۪t really care how much it costs, or what it will do to the federal budget deficit, or to economic growth or to worker productivity. He isn۪t even very picky about how , exactly, taxes for the rich are reduced, so long as they are diminished by a very large amount. His framework suggests eliminating the estate tax, dramatically slashing corporate taxes, reducing the top rate on individual income taxes, and limiting the levies on special pass through۝ accounts ۥ all perks that generate terrific sums for CEOs and hedge fund managers. If you want to tack on a few hundred dollars for middle-class families, Trump will not raise a fuss. We could describe this as a complex, disembodied economic idea ۥ the mathematical inelegance of extreme inequality or the fearful ratios implied by a ballooning deficit. But it is really a simple expression of power. The Trump tax plan is a public demonstration of the political priority the American government has decided to grant to the wealthiest members of our society. It is a clear, unequivocal statement that in America, some citizens are more equal than others. Everything else we can say about the plan with statistics is window-dressing. The billionaire donors cheering it on don۪t need the money. It will not make them wealthier in any meaningful sense. They will buy the same Herm̬s scarves and Tom Ford s unnies they would have purchased without it. Their yachts will continue to be elegantly contoured and divinely upholstered. Many quite literally cannot use the money Trump wants to offer them. One of the biggest perks in Trump۪s proposed framework is the elimination of the estate tax ۥ a levy that falls not on the millionaires of today, but on the inheritances of their heirs and heiresses. A wealthy individual needs to leave behind over $5 million to trigger the estate tax. For a married couple, the figure is nearly $11 million. So Trump loves the rich so much he will cut their taxes even when they are dead. And the ultra-rich love Trump۪s plan because it is a formal political recognition of their social prestige, an acknowledgement that they carry more weight than others in the political system we still optimistically refer to as a democracy. This is, as they see it, how it should be. It has, after all, been the way of things for decades. In 2010, billionaire Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman was enraged by President Barack Obama۪s suggestion that taxes on private equity and hedge fund managers be increased from 15 percent to 35 percent ۥ the level that other wealthy people have to pay on their salaries. It was war,۝ according to Schwartzman, who likened the plan to when Hitler invaded Poland.۝ Obama settled for 23.8 percent. I believe one of the major things people want from politicians is psychic income,۝ former House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) told HuffPost in 2014 . They want to be told that they are wonderful people, that their jobs are important for the human race, that they contribute greatly. Lloyd Blankfein was not really kidding when he said that, We are doing God۪s work.۪ That۪s his inner feeling. I don۪t think that the [Dodd-Frank financial reform] legislation really hurt them much, and I think a lot of them, frankly, some of them welcome it because they۪re not under competitive pressure to do stupid things  now, nobody can do them. But we really hurt their feelings mightily, particularly the president. You۪ve seen that with these ridiculous statements from Steve Schwarzman going on about Nazis.۝ Frank was close, but not quite right. Many Wall Streeters did have their feelings hurt when Obama told CBS that he didn۪t run for president to protect the paychecks of fat cat bankers.۝ But this was because the president۪s words implied a political demotion. After years of being celebrated as Masters of the Universe,۝ bankers were suddenly threatened with the prospect of becoming ordinary, humdrum members of a democracy; people whose actions might be subject to democratic forms of accountability. It must have been terrifying. Wall Street۪s very public freakout ۥ a fellow named Anthony Scaramucci implored Obama to stop bashing the Wall Street pi̱ata,۝ and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon declared he could now barely tolerate calling himself a Democrat ۥ obscured the profound degree to which Obama was protecting Wall Street interests. Obama named a top lobbyist from JPMorgan Chase as his chief of staff. He and his attorney general, Eric Holder, steadfastly refused to prosecute what everyone knew to be widespread criminality on Wall Street during the 2008 financial crisis. The Obama foreclosure relief plan became a vehicle for big banks to harvest funds from desperate families through illegal foreclosures . Obama even protected the bonuses at AIG and big banks that received taxpayer bailouts. When vulture fund investors descended on Puerto Rico, forcing the closure of schools and hospitals in the name of debt payments, Obama waved through a half-hearted reform plan that preserved the political priority of bondholders over basic social services. These bailouts and bonuses and other protections were not only infuriating because bankers were rich. They divorced socially destructive activity from political accountability. You could enrich yourself by destroying entire communities ۥ you could even break the law to do it ۥ and face no meaningful consequences. Members of a democracy, it seemed to many people, ought to be able to protect themselves from such abuses. And yet studies by respected academics from Princeton, Northwestern University and the University of Connecticut concluded that the concerns of the wealthy dominate the congressional agenda. Some reporters on Capitol Hill noticed the same trend . But the idea has generally been dismissed by Washington officialdom, which prides itself on interpreting the mathematical codes and metaphors that show why simple problems of power are in fact very thorny economic matters. Paul Ryan, in particular, hypnotized D.C. journalists in the days before he became House speaker with pronouncements about debt and deficits. Ryan۪s story conveniently excluded credit default swaps, proprietary trading and other high-risk activity on Wall Street. He warned of an inevitable debt crisis۝ just around the corner if America didn۪t cut its spending ۥ particularly on social programs for the poor and elderly. This wasn۪t because he hated the indigent, mind you ۥ he merely recognized that we now had too many takers۝ and not enough makers۝ and were nearing a tipping point.۝ He even found the magic number: If America۪s public debt reached 90 percent of its gross domestic product, we were headed for another 2008, only worse. The figure, based on research from two prominent conservative economists, was eventually discredited by a lowly graduate student who discovered it was the result of a very simple Microsoft Excel error. Today, as Trump proposes massive tax benefits for the super-rich, the deficit hawks and austerity mongers have fallen strangely silent. The profound ratios and disequilibria that once threatened to dissolve society itself have disappeared now that they are being fueled by tax cuts rather than spending programs. We can have a political system that respects its citizens as political equals, or we can have a society dominated by the arbitrary interests of unaccountable wealth. Trump, like Obama before him, has chosen the latter. In the not-so-distant past, polities ruled by unaccountable wealth have demonstrated a marked tendency to generate less accountability and an astonishing capacity for statistical deception and logical absurdity. In 1929, the global economy was in terrible shape. There was a tremendous amount of work to be done ۥ highways to be built, telephone lines to be wired, electrical grids to be constructed ۥ yet millions of people were out of work. The British economist John Maynard Keynes co-authored a political pamphlet with a simple solution: The government could hire the unemployed people to do the work. Financiers in the city of London were aghast at the idea, and told the public that it was all much more complicated than Keynes suggested. If the government hired people, after all, it would deprive future generations of the chance to get a job. All of the work would already have been done. Keynes knew he wasn۪t proposing anything particularly clever, just trying to knock down silly ideas that people only took seriously because they were delivered by very prestigious people. Our main task,۝ he wrote, will be to confirm the reader۪s instinct that what seems sensible is sensible, and what seems nonsense is nonsense.۝ No one in power listened to him then, and there will probably be plenty of Democrats and Republicans in Congress who shrug off critics of the Trump tax plan now. Our government, like those of the Gilded Age, likes to give the wealthy what they want. At least with Trump, we will not mistake a simple act of political domination for the music of the spheres."

Mueller, who was appointed special counsel in May, is looking into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the election, among other matters. Congressional committees are also investigating the matter. That Mueller continues to expand his team means the probe is not going to end anytime soon, said Robert Ray, who succeeded Kenneth Starr as independent counsel for the Whitewater investigation during the Clinton administration. It۪s an indication that the investigation is going to extend well into 2018,۝ said Ray. Whether it extends beyond 2018 is an open question.۝ The special counsel last month asked the White House to preserve all of its communications about a June 2016 meeting that included the president۪s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. Russian officials have denied meddling in the U.S. election, and Trump denies any collusion by his campaign. Among the cases Andres oversaw at the Justice Department was the prosecution of Texas financier Robert Allen Stanford, who was convicted in 2012 for operating an $8 billion Ponzi scheme. Before that, Andres was a federal prosecutor in Brooklyn for over a decade, eventually serving as chief of the criminal division in the U.S. attorney۪s office there. He prosecuted several members of the Bonanno organized crime family, one of whom was accused of plotting to have Andres killed. A graduate of Notre Dame and University of Chicago Law School, Andres was a Peace Corps volunteer in Benin from 1989 to 1992. He is married to Ronnie Abrams, a U.S. district judge in Manhattan nominated to the bench in 2011 by Democratic President Barack Obama. Others on the special counsel team include Andrew Weissmann, chief of the Justice Department۪s fraud section; Andrew Goldstein, former head of the public corruption unit at the U.S. Attorney۪s Office in Manhattan; and James Quarles, who was an assistant special prosecutor in the Watergate investigation that helped bring down President Richard Nixon."

Some even argued there was no point in government making the attempt. I don۪t think this is a problem a law is going to fix by itself,۝ Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said. HuffPost asked several GOP senators about possible government action two days after a gunman in Las Vegas killed at least 58 people and wounded more than 500 others ۥ the deadliest such attack in modern U.S. history. Studies say mass shootings are becoming more frequent and deadly , so it۪s likely only a matter of time before another bloody massacre spurs fresh calls for congressional action to curb gun violence. As Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) put it Tuesday on the Senate floor, How many of these can you have before you say enough is enough?۝ For some Republicans, though, mass shootings are the price of freedom ,۝ as former Fox News host Bill O۪Reilly put it. For others, the answer lies in preventing people with mental health problems from buying guns. Mental health reform is the critical ingredient to making sure that we can try and prevent some of these things that have happened in the past,۝ House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin told reporters Tuesday . Earlier this year, however, Republicans rescinded an Obama administration regulation that had made it tougher for the mentally ill to get a gun. They claimed the rule, put into place after the 2012 mass shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, unfairly impeded the Second Amendment rights of people with disabilities. No GOP senators who spoke with HuffPost expressed support for broader gun control measures, such as limiting magazine capacity or banning assault weapons. Some sounded resigned about their inability to address gun violence ۥ which kills over 30,000 people a year. Sadly, violence will always be part of our lives,۝ Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said. People are going to have to take steps in their own lives to take precautions to protect themselves,۝ said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota. Here۪s how the GOP senators responded to the question of what Congress can do to prevent mass shootings:  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) I think it۪s particularly inappropriate to politicize an event like this, it just happened in the last day-and-a-half. It۪s entirely premature to be discussing legislative solutions, if any. We۪re in the middle of an investigation. We۪ll see what that reveals. And at the end of that will be an appropriate time to discuss it. In the meantime, our priority is on tax reform, as my colleagues have indicated, we۪re going to press ahead with that in the Budget Committee this week.۝  Cruz The facts are still developing, but it appears this was a crazed madman and sadly violence will always be part of our lives. But it underscores the need for more effective law enforcement and more effective measures to prevent domestic terrorism. And I expect in the coming days the facts will develop as to whether there were warning signs that should have led to further investigation of this individual before he carried out this horrific attack.۝  Graham I don۪t know, I mean, let۪s find out, see if you can establish a motive. I mean, I don۪t know why he did it. Any laws he broke, any loopholes and laws he took advantage of? Other than that I۪m just at a loss. I don۪t think this is a problem a law is going to fix by itself.۝  Sen. Richard Shelby (Ala.) I don۪t know if legislation can [prevent mass shootings]. We cry that everything is a government problem and a government solution. But everything is not. That was a terrible thing that happened, the worst thing I۪ve ever seen. But from what I read and seen on TV ... the man didn۪t have a prior record, had no problems, [passed] a background check [when buying weapons], had no apparent obstacles to him. So, we۪re dealing with the human condition, sometimes it doesn۪t manifest itself very well. I don۪t know why anybody would want to kill anybody like that. But I don۪t know that the government can ۥ I tell you what we could do, is more checks in hotels, you know, just like it۪d be hard to take a gun [into Congress] because people are checking. I suppose, in the future when they build new buildings, they۪re going to have to think about security.۝ HuffPost: Do you want metal detectors on the doors of casinos? That۪s up to them, but I would think of any way to protect my clientele.۝  Sen. Johnny Isakson (Ga.) First of all, you never accept the fact that you can [prevent mass shootings]. So I۪m not even going to address answering that question. The second thing you ask is what you can do to help prevent them, and that۪s why we have a Congress and I۪m on my way to debate those issues. But you should never accept the fact that you can do it.۝  Sen. Cory Gardner (Colo.) I just met with a group of Colorado behavioral health providers, something that has had great bipartisan success ۥ working on mental health needs and finding out what۪s happened. Look, I mean, we need information on what happened in this terrible tragedy in Las Vegas, I think, to figure out really what can be done.۝  Sen. Pat Roberts (Kan.) This is a rather unique situation. I don۪t know all the facts and I don۪t think we will for the next couple of days until we figure out what was behind all this. This is not your typical person ۥ to do something as heinous as this. At least today, it۪s my understanding, that every firearm that he used is already illegal.۝  Sen. Bob Corker (Tenn.) I don۪t know, I really don۪t. I۪m all for looking at reasonable ways of ending mass killings. We always jump to something that has nothing to do with the event that just occurred.۝ ...  I۪m like everyone else in our nation, I۪d like to see it stop. ... I۪m not in any way indicating that I know of some change that needs to happen, but hopefully the Judiciary Committee and Homeland Security Committee hearings will enlighten us. It always seems that what comes out legislatively had nothing to do with the last incident. It۪s an impetus for something to happen that۪s unrelated. I do hope we۪ll have a fulsome discussion about the threat that we have. You can imagine this happening at a [Southeastern Conference college] football game. I know nothing about the background of this person, or what it was that drove him to do this. But it۪s a problem in a country that has the freedoms like we have, and so many mass events like that one was. I don۪t have the solution but I۪d be more than glad to listen to some.۝  Thune It sounds like he used conversion kits and other things, you know, to make these weapons more lethal. ... We۪ll look at the facts when we get them all in here. I think that all of us want to do everything we can to prevent tragedies like that from happening again. You know, it۪s an open society. And when somebody does what he wants to do, it۪s going to be hard to prevent anything.

Arpaio referred to his own county jail as a  concentration camp .۝ For over two decades, he operated Tent City,۝ where detainees were kept in brutal conditions, including temperatures soaring well above 100 degrees Farenheit . They were also forced to work on chain gangs and to wear pink undergarments as a form of humiliation. Arpaio was convicted in July of criminal contempt for ignoring a court order prohibiting the detention of people based on mere suspicions about their legal status. In an email to HuffPost Saturday, Andrea Pitzer, the author of One Long Night: A Global History of Concentration Camps ,defined a concentration camp as a mass civilian detention outside the standard legal process, usually on the basis of race, ethnicity, or political activity.۝ While Pitzer said Tent City was a prison technically constructed to hold those convicted by law, it bore familiar elements to a concentration camp, including brutal dehuminization.۝ Once Arpaio began neighborhood sweeps and traffic stops deliberately targeting Latinos, and then detaining them without charges, his whole enterprise tilted further toward being a concentration camp for that set of detainees,۝ she wrote. And even for those who had been convicted of crimes, it was a harrowing, often deadly experience.۝ Pitzer said Trump pardoning Arpaio legitimized the 85-year-old former sheriff۪s operation. When it was just Arpaio and his deputies doing it, it was a freelance, loose-cannon operation. What happened yesterday is that the President of the United States put his position behind it and used executive power to bless these tactics,۝ she wrote. Historically, when this kind of thing has happened, it۪s encouraged other people to take up the same tactics. I think we need to hear from the Department of Justice whether official guidance is forthcoming about the use of these strategies by law enforcement.۝ The White House said Friday Arpaio deserved a pardon because of his history in law enforcement. Trump has faced widespread criticism for his decision to pardon Arpaio, including from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.)."

And I۪ll tell you what ۥ I۪ve been watching this thing from the beginning. And I have to say, our Team USA,wow, did you play well.۝ Trump made his remarks at the Presidents Cup golf tournament at Liberty National Golf Course in Jersey City, New Jersey. Trump۪s attempt to appear engaged by giving a shout-out to the storm victims made the optics of the whole situation even worse. A person at the ceremony yelled, You don۪t give a shit about Puerto Rico!۝ according to reporters at the event. A golf trophy does nothing for the people who are struggling to recover after the devastating hurricane. Only 5 percent of Puerto Rico۪s electrical grid is back up and running, and it could be months before residents get regular service back. More than half the U.S. territory remains without drinking water. Trump is the first sitting U.S. president to present the trophy to the winning team, and the first sitting president to attend since 2000. Trump, however, loves golf. Last weekend, as the crisis in Puerto Rico was unfolding, the president spent time at his own private golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.Trump was there this weekend as well. Although his administration received praise for its response to the hurricanes that hit Florida and Texas, Trump has appeared more out-of-touch for Hurricane Maria. He and his top officials have insisted that they are doing a superb job responding, attracting harsh rebuttals from people who are actually on the ground. Elaine Duke, the acting head of the Department of Homeland Services, called what was happening in Puerto Rico  a good news story in terms of our ability to reach people and the limited number of deaths that have taken place.۝ That assessment was quickly hit down by the mayor of San Juan, who was disgusted by the comments.

Chris Baldridge told the publication that a few weeks after his 22-year-old son, Army Cpl. Dillon Baldridge, was gunned down by an Afghan police officer on June 10, he had a 15-minute phone call with the president. Baldridge said he told Trump of his struggle with the manner in which his son was killed,۝ according the Post story, and was offered $25,000 after telling the president about his frustration with the military۪s survivor benefits program. Baldridge said he can barely rub two nickels together,۝ and that his ex-wife would receive the Pentagon۪s $100,000 death gratuity because she was his son۪s beneficiary. According to the Post story:ʉ[Trump] said, I۪m going to write you a check out of my personal account for $25,000,۪ and I was just floored, Baldridge said. I could not believe he was saying that, and I wish I had it recorded because the man did say this. He said, No other president has ever done something like this,۪ but he said, I۪m going to do it.۪۝ But Baldridge told the Post he had not yet received a check yet. He said he did receive a condolence letter from the administration, adding that he opened it up and read it ... hoping to see a check in there.۝ I know it was kind of far-fetched thinking. But I was like, Damn, no check.۪ Just a letter saying I۪m sorry,۪۝ he told the Post. Shortly after the Post story appeared on the newspaper۪s website Wednesday, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said that a check was sent, but it was not made clear when that was. The story comes on the heels of backlash Trump is taking from some Gold Star families, who called the president۪s delayed response to the Oct. 4 deaths of U.S. soldiers in Niger  an abdication of his first duty as commander in chief to recognize the sacrifices of the troops and their families .۝ Trump waited more than a week to address the incident, and a call he made to the widow of one of the soldiers killed has become shrouded in controversy.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-tax-bill-technical-corrections_us_5a380422e4b01d429ccb49c8","WASHINGTON ۥ Republicans wrote their massive tax legislation in such a rush that even before they۪ve sent it to the president۪s desk, they۪re already talking about writing another bill to fix all the mistakes in the first one. Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), the lead author of the tax legislation in the House of Representatives, said Friday that he expected Congress would need to draft another bill to makeʉtechnical corrections.۝ I can۪t imagine any major undertaking like this that doesn۪t require technical corrections in the future,۝ Brady told reporters . Republicans have repeatedly adjusted major provisions of their legislation over the past several weeks. The final version of the bill released Friday contained yet more significant changes to a business deduction that tax experts have warned could result in a lot of creative accounting and unintended consequences. Technical corrections to major legislation are indeed common, but usually they aim to fix errors that lawmakers discover after passing a bill ۥ not ones they assume exist beforehand. Steven Rosenthal, a lawyer and tax expert who formerly worked for the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, said he was not aware of any other instance in which lawmakers anticipated technical corrections for tax legislation that had not even been enacted. This legislation is tax policy malfeasance,۝ Rosenthal said. Brady said he hoped Democrats would go along with fixing the tax bill post-passage ۥ a curious request since it wasn۪t so long ago that Republicans wanted nothing to do with corrections for another piece of major legislation: the Affordable Care Act. Obamacare contained drafting errors and mistakes, including one that nearly proved devastating to the law۪s implementation ۥ a passage that didn۪t specify whether tax credits for buying health insurance should be available in all states or just some.A simple one- or two-word change to the law۪s language would have cleared up the ambiguity. Rather than working with Democrats to enact such a measure, so that it had the votes to pass Congress, Republicans supported a lawsuit that, if successful, would have cut off the tax credits for millions ۥ leaving most of them with no health insurance at all. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court, which slapped it down by a 6-3 vote. But that history may loom large if or when Republicans turn to crafting technical fixes for the tax bill. GOP lawmakers are enacting the tax bill itself through the budget reconciliation process, which means that it can pass with a simple majority and no threat of a filibuster ۥ an essential requirement for the Republicans, because they have only 52 seats in the Senate now and that drops to 51 once Doug Jones takes the Alabama seat now occupied by a Republican.But a bill fixing the tax legislation next year would not necessarily have the same advantage of the lower Senate vote threshold, meaning Republicans could need Senate Democrats to get it done. We can do even more to improve this tax code,۝ Brady said. I۪m hopeful Democrats, who۪ve always said they۪re for tax reform but today are defending the status quo, I hope they rethink that and work with us to improve the code.۝ As congressional committees have written and rewritten parts of the GOP legislation over the past month, lobbyists and tax experts have already identified multiple apparent drafting errors that Republicans subsequently fixed , such as a mistake in the Senate bill that could have allowed employees to claim a deduction intended only for business owners. But it۪s not just additional little mistakes that Republicans might need to address going forward. There could be major substantive problems, too, because of policy choices made in the hasty construction of the bill. For instance, the House and Senate bills both eliminated deductions for state and local income taxes, but allowed filers to continue deducting what they pay in property taxes up to a $10,000 limit. The new joint bill, which combines the House and Senate versions, would allow filers to deduct a mix of property and income taxes up to that same amount. Limiting deductions is important because that offsets federal revenue loss, by more than $600 billion over 10 years, from the lower tax rates and other breaks in the legislation. But state governments, to defend their own budgets,could take actions that undermine that tradeoff. The effort to curb state and local tax deductions in particular would put pressure on states, since they could lose political support for taxes that can no longer be deducted on voters۪ federal tax returns. States might protect their revenue by reducing taxes on individual income and property while increasing taxes on business payrolls, which businesses could still deduct. And since the joint tax legislation would still let individuals take deductions for charitable donations, states might let people make deductible donations۝ in exchange for a state tax credit. Many states already have laws in place granting state income tax credits for donations to certain funds, and the IRS has allowed taxpayers who take advantage of these credits to deduct their payments as charitable contributions rather than as state taxes,۝ a group of tax scholars wrote in a paper published Monday,  The Games They Will Play ,۝ which identifies a wide array of tax avoidance ploys that could be fostered by the GOP tax bill. If states simply shift how they gather taxes, and households and businesses wind up deducting as much in local levies from their federal tax returns as they do currently, then the tax legislation would increase federal budget deficits by $600 billion more than Republicans intend. But Darien Shanske, a tax professor at the University of California Davis School of Law and one of the scholars who wrote that paper, suggested that the potential revenue loss is not necessarily something Republicans would act to fix,۝given that their legislation would already add more than $1 trillion to the national debt. They clearly don۪t care about the deficit,۝Shanske said. The provision that۪s probably gone through the most mutations, and the one experts say is ripest for abuse, is a new deduction for certain types of business income. Republicans wanted to cut business taxes, but since most commercial enterprises aren۪t taxed as corporations, cutting corporate tax rates wasn۪t enough. So lawmakers added a tax break for owners of pass through۝ firms whose business income is taxed on their individual returnsʉۥ a deduction worth 20 percent of qualified business income. If those kinds of firms end up paying a much lower effective tax rate than wealthy individuals do, high earners will have a strong incentive to find a way to reclassify their personal income as business profit. People with high incomes could turn themselves into pass-through business entities for tax purposes, despite provisions of the legislation that Republicans describe as guardrails۝ to prevent such gaming. The Senate bill had a list of business types not eligible for the new break, including doctors, lawyers, engineers, architects or any trade or business where the principal asset of such trade or business is the reputation or skill of one or more of its employees.۝ The final bill resembles the Senate version, but for some unknown reason, engineers and architects have been removed from the list of those restricted from taking the full deduction. The final bill also contains a new provision allowing pass-through companies to count the value of physical property toward their deduction ۥ an apparent gift to the real estate industry. Sorting out what type of businesses qualify for the pass-through deduction will be a major challenge for the Internal Revenue Service, one compounded by budget constraints and a short timeline. Republicans aim to pass the law this week, and then it would go into effect Jan. 1. The concept of allowing lower tax rates on income that passes through a partnership or that is earned by an independent contractor is completely novel,۝ Rosenthal said. This experiment is completely untested.۝"
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-mccain-puerto-rico-jones-act_us_59caebd1e4b02aef6cd6061d","UPDATE: Sept. 28 ۥ The White House announced Thursday that Trump waived the Jones Act for Puerto Rico for 10 days, effectively immediately. PREVIOUSLY: WASHINGTON ۥ Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is urging acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke to take an action that could significantly help Puerto Rico amid its unfolding humanitarian crisis: waive the Jones Act. The law requires that all goods shipped between U.S. ports be carried by American-owned and operated ships. That means Puerto Rico pays double the shipping costs for goods from the U.S. mainland compared to neighboring islands. DHS has gotten emergency waivers to the Jones Act twice in the last months in response to recent hurricanes, and McCain says Duke should waive the law again to speed up relief efforts on the island decimated last week by Hurricane Maria. It is unacceptable to force the people of Puerto Rico to pay at least twice as much for food, clean drinking water, supplies and infrastructure due to Jones Act requirements as they work to recover from this disaster,۝ McCain said in a Tuesday letter to Duke. We must treat this emergency relief with urgency ۥ every day that business owners are unable to recover their assets and account for lost business, the economy will retreat even further into devastation.۝ Here۪s the full letter: DHS was not receptive to McCain۪s request. DHS spokesman David Lapan declined to comment specifically on McCain۪s letter. But he said DHS۪ ability to waive the Jones Act is limited to national defense۝ purposes, and that its previous waiver was targeted specifically at disruptions in the oil supply system resulting from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The fuel concerns associated with Hurricane Harvey were driven by the loss of numerous refineries and the shutdown of the primary pipeline moving refined fuel to the East Coast and Southeast. In those cases, we needed additional vessel capacity to make up for those losses,۝ Lapan told HuffPost. We do not lack U.S.-flagged vessel capacity to move commodities to Puerto Rico.۝ Asked for comment on Puerto Rico having to pay twice as much for supplies at a time when it is economically and geographically devastated, Lapan said the department has not analyzed the potential cost savings of waiving the Jones Act since that is not material to our decision-making.۝ A group of eight House lawmakers reached out to Duke on Monday with the same waiver request as McCain. DHS did not appear supportive. McCain has been trying to repeal the Jones Act for years. He introduced a bill in 2010 to get rid of it, and then again in July. The law, formally known as the Merchant Marine Act, was enacted in 1920 to protect the U.S. shipping industry from foreign competitors. But critics say it is archaic and note that it costs Puerto Rico hundreds of millions of dollars every year. In his letter to Duke, McCain said that now is the time more than ever۝ to curb the harmful effects of the law on Puerto Rico. Since Hurricane Maria hit last week, at least 13 people have died and most of the 3.5 million Americans there don۪t have water, power or cell service. Just two weeks earlier, Hurricane Irma blew through and caused as much as $1 billion in damages to the island. (Click here to donate money to help). I am confident that repealing this law would lead to hastened recovery efforts where our country needs it most,۝ McCain said. I look forward to your assessment and recommendations to resolve this urgent issue.۝ This was updated to include additional comment from Lapan and information about the separate House lawmakers۪ request."

In his remarkable interview with the Times this week, Trump said he would have picked somebody else۝ if he knew before he nominated him that Attorney General Jeff Sessions was going to recuse himself from the Russia investigation, which Trump described as very unfair to the president.۝ Trump claimed ۥ inaccurately ۥ that the F.B.I. person really reports directly to the president of the United States,۝ a false assertion he called interesting.۝ Trump went on to reveal that he knew very little about Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man he appointed to the crucial No. 2 position in the Justice Department. Trump repeatedly said that Rosenstein was from Baltimore,۝ and complained that there are very few Republicans in Baltimore.۝ (Rosenstein, in fact, is a Republican. He was born in Philadelphia, has lived in the D.C. suburb of Bethesda, Maryland, for years, and spent much of his career working in the U.S. capital, except for when he commuted to Baltimore as U.S. attorney for Maryland.) This week certainly isn۪t the first time Trump violated DOJ norms. His direct overtures to former FBI director James Comey and former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara blurred the divisions between DOJ and the White House and made both men uncomfortable. There was the unusual sight of a U.S. attorney speaking from the White House press room. And Trump met directly with his nominee for U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, which CNN reported on Thursday was virtually unheard of۝ in past administrations. But his comments this week on Sessions, Rosenstein and special Counsel Robert Mueller went even further beyond the pale for many Justice Department veterans. And Trump۪s comments came as The Washington Post reports that the president is trying to learn more about his pardon power. It۪s not just Obama administration veterans who have concerns. John F. Wood , an attorney with the law firm of Hughes Hubbard & Reed who served as a counselor to the attorney general and as U.S. attorney for the Western District of Missouri during the George W. Bush administration, told HuffPost he found Trump۪s comments unusual۝ and a break with the traditional restrictions between the White House and DOJ. I could not imagine President Bush saying something like that about really anyone who worked for him,۝ Wood said. I think it hurts morale. I think it is disruptive, and it undermines the attorney general within the Justice Department. That said, I think people also recognize that President Trump changes his mind frequently, and so you never know if next week he۪s gonna say something very supportive of Jeff Sessions.۝ While Sessions brushed off resignation talk on Thursday morning,Bharara said he thinks Trump۪s comments make it next to impossible for him to do his job. Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates said that Trump۪s attack on Sessions۪ recusal on Russia reveals yet again his violation of the essential independence of DOJ, a bedrock principle of our democracy.۝ And former Attorney General Eric Holder said that Trump can۪t define or constrain۝ the Mueller investigation.Doing so would create constitutional, and criminal, issues, he said. Wood said Trump۪s comment on Sessions probably makes people a little bit nervous۝ about taking positions in the administration, but there are certain positions such as U.S. attorney that are highly sought after,۝despite Trump۪s statements. But I have heard that there are some positions that the Justice Department is having some trouble filling,۝ Wood said. He said that while he thinks that many Trump White House staffers are more aware of the limitations on DOJ contacts, the president is not. I think it۪s certainly correct that the president is not really familiar with the traditional lines between the Justice Department and the White House,۝ Wood said. The president himself is used to shooting from the hip and doesn۪t know that there۪s some things that he۪s better off not getting involved in.۝ In a series of tweets Saturday , Trump insisted he had complete power۝ to pardon and questioned why the Justice Department wasn۪t investigating Hillary Clinton or former FBI director James Comey."

But for Donald Trump , Hurricane Harvey has been a golden opportunity to promote himself. We want to be looked at in five years, in 10 years from now as, this is the way to do it ,۝ the president said on Tuesday. We want to do it better than ever before.۝ Right now, however, Trump wants to be looked at in a way that makes people say, I would really like to wear that hat, and I۪d be willing to pay that man $40 for it.۝ The president has repeatedly worn his own campaign merchandise , which is on sale at his website, to Hurricane Harvey events. Nearly every chance he gets, Trump brags about the size of his hurricane. He doesn۪t have to deal with just any old storm like his predecessors did ۥ he is confronting a huge storm. The biggest storm you۪ve ever seen. A storm that only he could handle. And of course, he wants everyone to know that he and his administration are doing a heckuva job . Trump also continued to tout how many supporters he has, and the size of his crowds, which he also does at nearly every campaign rally. On Tuesday, he remarked on the crowd size while visiting Corpus Christi, saying,  What a crowd, what a turnout .۝ He was at a fire station to meet with local officials about the disaster response. It was not a rally. Reporters at the event heard no mention from the president of the dead, suffering or displaced Texans, nor did they hear Trump express any sympathy for them, according to a Dallas Morning News reporter. Trump seems to be taking a certain amount of satisfaction from the attention he and the hurricane are getting on TV, where cable news has nearly non-stop coverage. On Tuesday, Trump boasted that Federal Emergency Management Director Brock Long has really become very famous on television over the last couple of days.۝ And he defended his decision to pardon controversial Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio during Harvey, saying he did so because of how many people were tuning in: I assumed the ratings would be far higher .۝ On the same day that Trump was tweeting about the size of the hurricane, his great rescue operation, NAFTA and his insistence that Mexico will pay for the border wall, former President Barack Obama tweeted a donation link to the Red Cross.

At that meeting, he was told, he could obtain some official documents and information that would incriminate۝ former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Trump Jr., President Donald Trump۪s eldest son,released the images just as The New York Times published a story describing the emails. An editor for the Times confirmed that Trump Jr. posted the emails after being informed of the Times۪ story. In an email sent to Trump Jr. on June 3, 2016, music promoter Rob Goldstone said he could facilitate a meeting to provide Trump Jr. with information that would be very useful to your father,۝ at the time a Republican presidential candidate. The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,۝ Goldstone wrote in an email to Trump Jr. This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government۪s support for Mr. Trump ۥ helped along by Aras and Emin,۝ Goldstone added. What do you think is the best way to handle this information and would you be able to speak to Emin about it directly?۝ Trump Jr. replied, If it۪s what you say I love it.۝ The documents posted by Trump Jr. show that he forwarded the email exchange to Trump۪s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is now a presidential adviser, and to Paul Manafort, Trump۪s then-campaign manager, on June 8 ۥ one day before the meeting took place at Trump Tower in New York. As The New York Times notes, there۪s no evidence in the emails to suggest the meeting was related to the Russian hacking of Democratic National Committee emails, many of which were provided to WikiLeaks and released over the last few months of the presidential campaign. Tuesday۪s revelation comes after an earlier New York Times story on Trump Jr.۪s meeting with the Kremlin-linked lawyer.In response to that story, published Saturday, Trump Jr. claimed he primarily discussed۝ an adoption program with the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, whose clients have included Russian state-owned businesses and the son of a senior Russian government official. Trump Jr.changed his statement a day later, admitting he attended the meeting to obtain potentially helpful information۝ about Clinton. The president has so far remained silent on the controversy, tweeting instead about Senate Democrats, the Olympics and a military plane crash .Mark Corallo, the spokesman for the president۪s personal lawyer, told The New York Times on Sunday that the president  was not aware of and did not attend the meeting.۝ In a statement on Tuesday , Vice President Mike Pence۪s press secretary said Pence was not aware of the meeting."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/climate-change-report-draft-nyt_us_598907ece4b0a66b8bae1fc6","WASHINGTON  Contrary to President Donald Trump and his team۪s repeated claims, government scientists agree that climate change is already having a dramatic effect in the U.S. In a nearly 700-page draft report , scientists from 13 federal agencies conclude that the planet has rapidly warmed over the last 150 years, triggering many other changes to Earth۪s climate,۝ and find it extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.۝  Evidence for a changing climate abounds , from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans,۝ states the fifth and final draft of the report, still under review and posted this week by The New York Times. Thousands of studies conducted by tens of thousands of scientists around the world have documented changes in surface, atmospheric, and oceanic temperatures; melting glaciers; disappearing snow cover; shrinking sea ice; rising sea level; and an increase in atmospheric water vapor. Rainfall patterns and storms are changing and the occurrence of droughts is shifting,۝ the report reads.ʉMany lines of evidence demonstrate that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are primarily responsible for the observed climate changes in the industrial era, especially over the last six decades.۝ The draft,completed this year and part of the National Climate Assessment, has already been approved by the National Academy of Sciences , according to the Times. Its official release hinges on the Trump administration ۪s approval. On Monday, the Times published a story about a previous third draft, which it said had not been made public. One scientist who worked on the report told the Times that he and others feared the president would withhold it.On Wednesday, however, the Times issued a correction noting that, while not widely publicized, the report was uploaded by the nonprofit Internet Archive in January.۝ Indeed, the third draft of the report  which the Times based its article on  has been available for months and was even open for public comment, as co-authors pointed out on Twitter. It also continues to be available by request from the National Academy of Sciences. The Times subsequently published the fifth and final draft. Katharine Hayhoe , a co-author of the report and professor of political science at Texas Tech University, told HuffPost in an email Wednesday that the fifth draft is undergoing its final interagency review, which ends Aug. 18. The final draft, she said, differs from the third in that it includes revisions made in response to the National Academy of Sciences review. While the substantive messages did not change between the 3rd and 5th drafts, responses to NAS comments included adding new figures and references, expanding some sections of the text, and condensing others,۝ she wrote. According to the latest draft, scientists predict the average annual temperature will continue to rise throughout the century. Over the next two decades alone, global temperatures could increase between 0.5 and 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit. With very high confidence,۝ the scientists concluded that the magnitude of climate change beyond the next few decades will depend primarily on the amount of greenhouse (heat-trapping) gases emitted globally and on the remaining uncertainty in the sensitivity of Earth۪s climate to those emissions.۝ Since 1880, global sea levels have risen 8 to 9 inches, according to the draft report. In a post to Twitter, Gavin Schmidt, a climate scientist and director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said that nothing in the report is surprising for people working in the field but that it may be shocking to those that think [climate change] is just a future problem.۝ The report delivers a strikingly different message than the one being pushed by Trump and his Cabinet members, who continue to downplay the urgency of the threat as they work toward energy dominance.۝ Since taking office, Trump  who famously called climate change  bullshit ۝ and a Chinese hoax ۝  has moved quickly to derail America۪s actions to combat climate change , including rolling back President Barack Obama ۪s Clean Power Plan , a policy limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. Trump has pegged himself as a savior of America۪s dying coal industry and has vowed to increase oil and gas production, opening now-protected areas of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans to drilling. In June he announced plans to pull the U.S. out of the historic Paris Agreement on climate change ۥ the international accord in which nearly 200 countries committed to slashing carbon emissions in an effort to prevent global temperatures from increasing 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels,the line scientists say the world must stay below to stave off the very worst effects of climate change. Meanwhile, his Cabinet members have refused to say whether Trump believes climate change is real and continue to question how much the scientific community understands about the threat and the role humans play in observed changes. In March, Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt told CNBC,  No, I would not agree that [carbon dioxide is] a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.۝ And in June, Energy Secretary Rick Perry echoed Pruitt۪s comments , saying no۝ when asked by CNBC whether he believes carbon dioxide is the primary control knob for the temperature of the Earth and for climate.۝ Most likely the primary control knob is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in,۝ Perry said.ʉI mean, the fact is, this shouldn۪t be a debate about, Is the climate changing? Is man having an effect on it?۪ Yeah, we are. The question should be, you know, just how much, and what are the policy changes that we need to make to affect that?۝ Perry went on to defend his and others۪ denial of near-universally accepted climate science, suggesting that those who question the scientific community۪s findings are more intelligent. Also in June, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said glaciers in Montana۪s Glacier National Park started melting  right after the end of the Ice Age ۝ and that it has been a consistent melt.۝ He also dismissed the notion that government scientists can predict with certainty how much warming will occur by 2100 under a business-as-usual scenario. How the Trump administration decides to handle the report remains to be seen.The EPA and 12 other agencies have until Aug. 18 to approve the report. During George W. Bush ۪s presidency, federal scientists were discouraged from talking about climate change and even had climate change research altered . This article has been updated throughout to reflect the New York Times۪ correction about the draft version of the climate change report."

Mr. Manafort has consistently cooperated with law enforcement and other serious inquiries and did so on this occasion as well.۝ Manafort had no advance warning about the raid, which took place July 26. According to the Post, documents and other materials۝ were seized. Manafort is a key figure in the investigation into the Trump campaign۪s ties to Russia. One day before the raid, Manafort met with Senate Intelligence Committee investigators to discuss a meeting of a Russian lawyer and members of Trump۪s campaign team that took place during the 2016 presidential election. Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni said the former campaign chairmanʉanswered their questions fully.۝ On June 27, Manafort retroactively registered as a foreign agent thanks to$17.1 million his firm was paid from 2012 to 2014 for lobbying work he did on behalf of a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/net-neutrality-rules-repealed_us_5a31a282e4b01bdd7659c5c4","In a victory for internet service providers like AT&T, Comcast and Verizon, the Federal Communications Commission voted Thursday to repeal net neutrality rules. FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai , who was appointed by President Donald Trump , forged ahead with the vote,despite widespread opposition and a request from 18 state attorneys general to delay it over concerns that the public comment process was corrupted by fraudulent messages.The repeal proposal passed 3-2 on party lines. The hearing was temporarily delayed  and the room evacuated  by a bomb threat before Pai could cast the fifth and final vote. Commissioners were permitted to continue after police and dogs searched the empty chamber. The repeal rolls back so-called Title II۝ regulations that classified the internet as a public utility, and which, among other things, required internet service providers, or ISPs, to treat all of the data traveling on their networks equally. Without the protections of Title II, those ISPs can now legally begin treating data from some websites differently than others. So Comcast, for instance, could charge customers who use Netflix extra for using so much bandwidth; AT&T could, in theory, decide to block access to some websites entirely; or Verizon, which owns HuffPost۪s parent company Oath, could hypothetically decide wireless customers won۪t be charged data when they۪re viewing HuffPost content. (HuffPost۪s union is represented by the Writers Guild of America, East, which supports net neutrality and opposed its repeal.) Immediately after Thursday۪s vote, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman pledged to sue to halt the FCC۪s actions. In Congress, Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) joined with 15 other senators to contest the FCC decision via a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution. We will fight the FCC۪s decisions in the courts, and we will fight it in the halls of Congress,۝ Markey said in a statement . With this CRA, Congress can correct the Commission۪s misguided and partisan decision and keep the internet in the hands of the people, not big corporations.۝ Large tech companies like Netflix and Twitter also reiterated their support for the now-defunct rules. In a conference call with reporters Wednesday ahead of the vote, telecom industry executives sought to calm the storm of public opinion. Michael Powell, the head of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association and a former FCC chairman, argued that just because it۪s now legal for ISPs to discriminate against internet traffic and create fast lanes doesn۪t mean they will. We can۪t live by a principle that just because there isn۪t a rule banning something, it doesn۪t mean necessarily that something is going to happen,۝ he said. There are a lot of things in our society we don۪t expressly prohibit, but it doesn۪t mean that they۪re going to happen,۝ he added. There۪s no law that says I can۪t paint my house hot pink, but I assure you I have no intention of doing it.۝ He called arguments to the contrary  that ISPs are only repealing net neutrality rules so they can engage in the sort of behavior that would otherwise have been prohibited  a very lazy and unfounded way of looking at the problem.۝ While ISPs have previously pledged not to prioritize web traffic in this manner, under the new rules, customers can۪t do much but take them at their word. And their word is no ironclad guarantee. Last week, Comcast quietly altered a net neutrality pledge that had been on its website since 2014, removing a promise that it wouldn۪t prioritize internet traffic or create paid fast lanes۝ and replacing it with a much more cautious pledge to not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content.۝ If Comcast decides on a whim to change its pledge again next week,it absolutely can. In addition to repealing net neutrality, the new FCC rules also strip state and local governments of the power to enact their own laws regulating broadband service. That provision alarmed a group of nearly five dozen mayors from across the political spectrum, who signed a public letter last week slamming the FCC۪s actions as a stark, inexplicable, and unwarranted attack on the constitutional principles that lie at the heart of our system of government.۝ A collective of internet activist groups that have united under the banner ofʉ Team Internet ۝ responded to the repeal by calling on Congress to review and overturn the FCC۪s action. The telecom industry spent millions lobbying and spreading misinformation to pit Internet users against each other and turn net neutrality into a partisan issue,۝ the group said in an emailed statement to HuffPost. They have failed.۝ Net neutrality has more public support now than it ever has before. Internet users are educated, outraged, and strategic, and they know that Congress has the power to overturn the FCC vote,۝ the statement continued. Lawmakers cannot hide from their constituents on this issue. The Internet has given ordinary people more power than ever before. We۪re going to fight tooth and nail to make sure no one takes that power away.۝"

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-judicial-nominee-grasz-unqualified_us_59fa1df9e4b0b0c7fa37aa85","WASHINGTON ۥ Two days after the American Bar Association rated Leonard Steven Grasz not qualified۝ to be a judge, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a confirmation hearing Wednesday for Grasz۪s nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. It was brutal. With Grasz sitting in front of the committee, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) read aloud passages from the ABA۪s eight-page statement outlining why Grasz earned such a terrible and rarely designated rating by the nation۪s premier legal society. I assume you۪re keenly aware that you are the first Circuit Court nominee since 2006 to receive a unanimous not qualified۪ rating from the ABA?۝ Whitehouse asked Grasz. And that the last nominee who had such a rating was withdrawn?۝ That is my understanding, senator,۝ replied Grasz. Awkward! It only got worse. Do you think that this is a matter as to which the committee should have no concern?۝ asked Whitehouse. I have great respect for the amount of time and effort the American Bar Association put into the process,۝ said Grasz. I respectfully disagree with the result.۝ The Rhode Island senator noted that the ABA rated Grasz not qualified۪ in a unanimous 14-0 vote. He asked Grasz if he knew that was the tally. I۪m not keenly aware of that,۝ said Grasz. I believe there was one abstention.۝ That۪s why it۪s 14,۝ Whitehouse replied. There are 15 of them.... It۪s the full panel of 14 non-abstaining lawyers.۝ The ABA interviewed several colleagues of Grasz, who was Nebraska۪s chief deputy attorney general for 11 years, as part of its evaluation of his fitness to be a judge. Some described him as gratuitously rude.۝ Others expressed an unusual fear۝ of consequences if they said anything bad about him because of his deep connection and allegiance۝ to powerful politicians in Nebraska. ABA members also raised concerns that Grasz would be unable to separate his role as an advocate from that of a judge,۝ given his record on such issues as abortion. Among other things, he defended Nebraska۪s ban on partial-birth abortion, and, in a 1999 article, he argued that lower courts should be able to overrule Supreme Court decisions on abortion rights because abortion jurisprudence is, to a significant extent, a word game.۝ In sum, the evaluators and the Committee found that temperament issues, particularly bias and lack of open-mindedness, were problematic,۝ reads the statement submitted by Pam Bresnahan, the chair of the ABA۪s standing committee that reviews nominees. The evaluators found that the people interviewed believed that the nominee۪s bias and the lens through which he viewed his role as a judge colored his ability to judge fairly.۝ White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley defended Grasz۪s nomination. Steve Grasz is an outstanding lawyer, who has the full-throated support of the President, both U.S. Senators from Nebraska, and lawyers on each side of the political spectrum,۝ Gidley told HuffPost in a Wednesday statement. The ABA claims to be non-partisan, but the facts show it cannot be trusted to fairly evaluate exceptional nominees.۝ Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), who recommended Grasz to Trump, told the Senate committee she was shocked۝ by the ABA rating. She said she didn۪t come across one single temperament issue۝ when she talked to Nebraskans about Grasz. I am sad to say that, after thoroughly examining the substance of the ABA۪s report, it is evident to me the ABA evaluation of Mr. Grasz was a baseless political character assassination,۝ Fischer said. But Whitehouse pointed out that 40 of the 42 judicial nominees Trump has put forward so far have gottenʉqualified۝ or well qualified۝ ratings by the ABA. (Charles Goodwin, Trump۪s pick for a district court in Oklahoma, was the other nominee rated not qualified.۝) It would be hard for the committee to ascribe the outcome in this case to a general partisanship of the ABA process,۝ said the Democratic senator. It would not be consistent with the facts.۝ It۪s up to the White House to decide if it wants to plow ahead with Grasz. If the president doesn۪t withdraw his nomination, the Judiciary Committee could vote to advance him to the full Senate in a matter of weeks. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who chairs the committee, said Wednesday that he invited ABA representatives to testify at a Nov. 15 hearing about their Grasz rating. They accepted, he said, so that hearing will happen before Grasz is scheduled for his committee vote. This story has been updated to include Grassley۪s comments."

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said on Wednesday that they had reached an agreement with Trump to tie measures to grant Dreamers legal status to border security measures, but not to a wall. They said Trump had made clear he would continue to demand a wall, and that they had told him they would oppose it. Trump denied that a deal had been made, although he initially did not dispute key details of what the Democrats had said. But later, he said Dreamers۪ fates would be tied to the construction of a border wall, even if it۪s not part of legislation that addresses Dreamers. We have to be sure the wall isn۪t obstructed, because without the wall, I wouldn۪t do anything. _ It doesn۪t have to be here but they can۪t obstruct the wall if it۪s in a budget or anything else,۝ Trump told reporters in Florida, according to a pool report. He added that he wouldʉonly do it if we get extreme security, not only surveillance but everything that goes with surveillance,۝ Trump said. If there۪s not a wall, we۪re doing nothing.۝ The president also created more confusion by suggesting that he might not support allowing Dreamers to eventually gain citizenship. That would destroy any hope of a deal with Democrats, who want Trump to support the Dream Act, which would allow undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children to eventually become citizens. We۪re not looking at citizenship,۝ he said. We۪re not looking at amnesty. We۪re looking at allowing people to stay here.۝ That doesn۪t necessarily preclude eventually supporting Dream Act-style measures, however. The bill would not grant citizenship immediately; it would allow Dreamers to gain legal status that would make them eligible for eventual citizenship ۥ so there۪s potential that Trump could eventually back such measures and still claim they were not the amnesty۝ he opposes. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) similarly insisted that there was no deal on Dreamers. He said on Thursday that Trump told him there was no agreement۝ made with Democrats. It was a discussion, not an agreement or a negotiation,۝ Ryan said. Ryan laid out his own conditions on Dreamers: You cannot fix DACA without fixing the root cause of our problem. We do not have control of our borders.So we need border security and enforcement as part of any agreement.۝ Earlier on Thursday,Trump said in a series of tweets that any deal on Dreamers would be contingent on massive border security,۝although he didn۪t specify that it had to include a wall. He added that the wall isʉ already under construction in the form of new renovation of old and existing fences and walls۝ and would proceed. Trump also told reporters outside the White House on Thursday that  the wall will come later .۝ Asked if he favors amnesty, the president replied that the word is DACA,۝ referring to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The president also seemed to throw cold water on concerns that he wanted to deport beneficiaries of the DACA program. Pelosi and Schumer confirmed in their statement on Thursday that no final deal had been put in place. But they added,ʉWhile both sides agreed that the wall would not be any part of this agreement, the President made clear he intends to pursue it at a later time, and we made clear we would continue to oppose it.۝ Many of Trump۪s staunchest supporters, including Fox News Host Sean Hannity and conservative commentator Ann Coulter, quickly lashed out at reports that president seemed to be softening his stance on immigration. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders later tweeted that excluding the wall was certainly not agreed to ,۝ but a spokesman for Schumer shot back that, while the wall wasn۪t dead yet, it wasn۪t part of this deal specifically. This story has been updated to include Trump۪s additional comments to reporters, Ryan۪s comments, and a statement from Pelosi and Schumer."

In a 3-2 ruling, the Republican majority tightened the standards for determining when a company qualifies as a joint employer۝ for the purposes of labor law. As a result, it will be harder for unions and workers to file complaints against fast-food chains or other big companies that rely on franchisees and contractors to oversee work. The two Democratic members dissented. Earlier this year, McDonald۪s was put on trial as a potential joint employer so that it might be held responsible for violating the rights of workers employed by its franchisees. That case has not been ruled on yet, and the change in precedent Thursday could knock a hole in the workers۪ argument. While business groups cheered the policy change, labor groups and Democrats condemned it as a setback for worker rights. This shocking and brazen decision to overturn pro-worker precedent is further proof the Trump Administration will stop at nothing to line the pockets of corporations  no matter what price workers and their families are forced to pay,۝ Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate۪s labor committee, said in a statement after the ruling. The NLRB is an independent agency that referees disputes between employers and unions, though the policies it sets affect all private-sector workers, whether they۪re in unions or not. Trump recently filled two vacancies on the board with Republican picks, flipping the board from liberal to conservative for the first time in eight years. The board under President Barack Obama issued a number of decisions that enraged employer groups, the joint employer ruling chief among them. The then-liberal majority said that companies shouldn۪t be able to dodge their responsibilities to workers by using subcontractors or franchisees. If a company at the top of the contracting chain exerts control over the working conditions at the bottom, they reasoned, then it should qualify as an employer. The ruling Thursday reverts to an older standard for joint employment that makes it harder to hold the company at the top accountable. The National Restaurant Association, a leading industry lobby, said Thursday that it applauds۝ the new ruling. Today۪s decision restores years of established law and brings back clarity for restaurants and small businesses across the country.۝"

However, the validity of those comments was questioned on Monday when The Washington Post reported that Trump had personally dictated the response his elder son would use to address the media. The president۪s lawyer Jay Sekulow appeared on a series of Sunday news shows last month to defend the commander in chief following reports that Trump Jr. had met with attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya after being promised damaging information about 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton .

It was only after the Times followed up in preparation for another article that Trump Jr. issued a second (conflicting) statement. Sekulow issued a one-line statement in response to the latest story in the Post. Apart from being of no consequence, the characterizations are misinformed, inaccurate and not pertinent,۝ it reads.

On the day of the show Franken and I were alone backstage going over our lines one last time,۝Tweeden wrote in a post for 790 KABC, the radio station she works for in Los Angeles.

I said something like,ʉRelax Al, this isn۪t SNL... we don۪t need to rehearse the kiss.۪ He continued to insist, and I was beginning to get uncomfortable.۝ She finally relented, she said: We did the line leading up to the kiss and then he came at me, put his hand on the back of my head, mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth. I immediately pushed him away with both of my hands against his chest and told him if he ever did that to me again I wouldn۪t be so nice about it the next time. I walked away. All I could think about was getting to a bathroom as fast as possible to rinse the taste of him out of my mouth. I felt disgusted and violated. She did end up performing the skit as written, she continued, turning her head away while on stage so Franken couldn۪t kiss her. When Tweeden was on her way home to Los Angeles, she said, she fell asleep on the plane. While she slept, Franken grabbed her breasts and had a photo taken. I couldn۪t believe it. He groped me, without my consent,while I was asleep,۝ she wrote. I felt violated all over again. Embarrassed. Belittled. Humiliated. How dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it۪s funny?۝ Franken, who was elected to the Senate in 2008, responded to Tweeden۪s account in a press statement Thursday. I certainly don۪t remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann,۝ he said. As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn۪t.

The report is deeply disturbing and does not reflect the values of the USO.۝ At a news conference Thursday afternoon , Tweeden explained why she didn۪t speak out at the time.

When Tapper asked why Moore believed that Muslim Americans should be barred from Congress, Crockett said it was because the former judge thinks it۪s unethical for Muslims to swear on the Bible. You have to swear on the Bible to be an elected official in the United States of America,۝ Crockett claimed. Then Tapper informed the campaign spokesman that elected officials can be sworn in on any text of their choosing. Crockett, a former county commissioner, was left speechless.

When Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), a Muslim, took office in 2007, for example, he exercised his constitutional right to religious freedom and took a ceremonial oath using a Quran once owned by Thomas Jefferson . Other lawmakers have taken their oaths on the Constitution itself. After Crockett۪s interview aired, Rep.

It۪s pure fantasy to think that the tax bill will lead to significantly higher wages and growth.۝ Guthrie then pushed Ryan, asking: I۪ll ask you plainly, are you living in a fantasy world?۝ Ryan insisted surveys show that the huge corporate tax cuts at the center of the GOP bill will spur business leaders to pay people more money, higher wages.۝ Senate Republicans passed the bill early Wednesday , and the House is poised to give it final approval later in the day and send it to President Donald Trump. Ryan۪s efforts to defend the measure come amid one new poll showing only 24 percent of Americans think its a good idea. Attacks on the bill include that it benefits the wealthy, as opposed to the dwindling middle class, and that it will add an estimated $1.6 trillion to the government۪s deficit. On ABC۪s  Good Morning America ۝ on Wednesday, Ryan rebuffed the criticism about the bill not helping the middle class. I think minds are going to change and I think people are going to change their view on this,۝ he said. On the Today۝ show, he told Guthrie that it isn۪t possible to predict how the tax bill would affect the deficit. Guthrie referred to Ryan as a longtime budget hawk,۝ and asked:ʉAre you saying that the growth you۪re going to get from this tax cut will equal the amount it would cost on the deficit side so that it۪s a wash, so that you۪re not adding to the deficit at all because of this?۝ she asks. Nobody knows the answer to that question because that۪s in the future,۝ he said. But what we do know, this will increase economic growth.۝ He went on to say that many Americans areʉliving paycheck to paycheck,۝ and that another group of people in this country are about one check away from living paycheck to paycheck,۝ and the U.S. needs faster economic growth so that people can get ahead.۝ That۪s what we۪re doing,۝ Ryan said. The average tax cut for the median family of four in America is going to be $2,059. $2,000, if you۪re living paycheck to paycheck, is a serious tax cut.۝ Journalist Soledad O۪Brien responded to Ryan۪s comment with a tweet noting that a family of four that gets a $1 million dollar tax cut and a family of four with zero tax cut has an average۪ of half a million in tax cuts.۝ Projecting deficits, meanwhile, is always a matter of looking into the future, so Ryan۪s answer on the issue skirted the key question of the tax bill۪s impact of the government۪s red ink.

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jared-kushner-russian-lawyer_us_59664aa9e4b005b0fdca6b34","As attention focuses on Donald Trump Jr. for meeting with a Kremlin-connected lawyer to obtain negative information about Hillary Clinton, it۪s easy to overlook how damaging and embarrassing the episode is for Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump ۪s son-in-law and one of his closest advisers. Kushner attended the June 2016 meeting in New York, along with Trump۪s then-campaign manager, Paul Manafort. Kushner۪s lawyers recently discovered he failed to disclose it on a form he submitted to obtain a security clearance, according to The New York Times. Last Saturday, the Times broke the story on the meeting. Trump Jr. told Fox News۪ Sean Hannity on Tuesday night that Kushner attended the meeting with the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, for just a few minutes before he left. Kushner۪s lawyers reportedly have amended his security clearance form to disclose the meeting. But that wasn۪t the only such omission by Kushner. He maintains a security clearance even though he failed to mention multiple meetings with Russian officials on the form he submitted before the Trump administration took office. Those meetings were with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the U.S., and the head of a Russian-owned bank. Knowingly omitting such information is a crime; Kushner۪s lawyer has said the omissions were just an error . Also raising questions about Kushner۪s security clearance is a McClatchy report detailing investigations in Congress and by the Justice Department into whether the Trump campaign۪s digital team, overseen by Kushner, directed Russian operatives to key states. McClatchy reported DOJ investigators are skeptical that Russians spreading fake news would have known the areas to target on their own. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Wednesday called on Kushner to resign, saying he knowingly allowed Trump and Vice President Mike Pence to falsely say that no one in their campaign had contacts with Russian officials. You don۪t think the Republicans would be calling for the resignation of an Obama official who allowed the president and vice president to openly lie about a major national security issue?۝ Murphy told reporters on Capitol Hill. He watched his father-in-law on TV say no one in [Trump۪s] campaign talked to the Russian government.۝ Kushner knew that was false,۝ Murphy said. Either he didn۪t alert the president and vice president, or there is a much bigger problem, and the president and vice president knew they were lying. There is a crisis of trust that the White House has to deal with.۝ Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said Kushner should probably۝ lose his security clearance. That۪s the decision the president gets to make,۝ he said,in response to a question about whether Kushner should step down. Let me put it this way: If he were not related by marriage to the president, I think he۪d already be gone.۝ Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.)also called on Kushner to resign on Monday. The president۪s legal team is reportedly frustrated by the way Kushner has advised Trump on the probes into alleged collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign while not being entirely forthcoming about his own activities that have drawn scrutiny. The New York Times reported Trump۪s legal team sees Kushner as an obstacle more concerned with his own self-interest than that of the president. Like his father-in-law, Kushner had no direct experience with a presidential campaign prior to the 2016 race. He was one of Trump۪s most trusted advisers on the campaign trail and has continued to serve in that capacity in the White House. But Kushner allies now believe his lack of political experience may be hurting him .

Charlie Rose asked Bannon, appearing on 60 Minutes۝ in his first televised interview since departing the Trump administration on Aug. 18, if rumors were true that he had described Comey۪s firing as the biggest mistake in political history.۝ That probably would be too bombastic, even for me,۝Bannon said, but maybe modern political history.۝ He added that Comey۪s departure directly spawned the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation into possible collaboration between the Trump administration and Russia to interfere in the 2016 election. I don۪t think there۪s any doubt that if James Comey had not been fired, we would not have a special counsel,۝ Bannon said. We would not have the Mueller investigation and the breadth that clearly Mr. Mueller is going for.۝ Bannon, largely credited with shaping the White House۪s policy since Trump۪s inauguration, left the administration last month and returned to Breitbart News, the right-wing website he ran from 2012 until he took a leave of absence in 2016 to join the Trump campaign. During the interview, Bannon also lambasted the pearl-clutching mainstream media۝ and said he is absolutely۝ going to war with Republican leaders, who he said were trying to nullify the 2016 election.۝ They۪re not gonna help you unless they۪re put on notice,۝ Bannon said, specifically pointing to Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). They۪re gonna be held accountable if they do not support the president of the United States. Right now, there۪s no accountability.۝ Earlier on Sunday, Politico reported that Bannon was planning to aid primary challenges against GOP senators who are unsupportive of Trump۪s agenda. Bannon, who described himself in the interview as a street fighter,۝ also said the government needed to focus on American citizens۝ when Rose asked about his position on DACA , the Obama-era program that offers some protections to young undocumented immigrants. America was, in the eyes of so many people, and it۪s what people respect America for, it is people have been able to come here, find a place, contribute to the economy,۝ Rose said. That۪s what immigration has been in America. And you seem to want to turn it around and stop it.۝ You couldn۪t be more dead wrong,۝ Bannon countered. America was built on her citizens ... This country۪s gonna be greater, more united, more powerful than it۪s ever been ...This is not astrophysics, ok? And by the way, that۪s every nationality, every race, every religion, every sexual preference. As long as you۪re a citizen of our country.

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-voter-fraud-investigation_us_5957c971e4b0da2c7323d93c","President Donald Trump cast doubt about the neutrality of a commission he created to investigate election integrity,۝ tweeting that it was a probe focused on voter fraud. Critics have warned that the creation of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity is just a way of looking for voter fraud, which several previous probes have found is not a widespread problem. Trump himself confirmed those fears when he labeled the probe a voter fraud panel۝ in a tweet Saturday morning and suggested election officials ۥ including at least one Republican ۥ were concealing information about illegal voters. The White House has sought to present the panel, created in May, as a bipartisan, neutral effort to investigate confidence in elections. In a conference call mapping out logistics for the commission this week, Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), who are leading the commission, told commissioners they were open to whatever the commission would find and didn۪t want anyone to have preconceived notions about what its conclusions would be. Appearing on MSNBC Friday, Kobach, who has a history of stoking fears about voter fraud , said the purpose of the panel wasn۪t to confirm Trump۪s unsubstantiated claim that millions voted illegally in the 2016 election. Kobach said Friday we may never know۝ if that۪s true. Trump۪s revealing tweet came after several states refused to comply with the commission۪s request for voter information, saying they would not assist the commission in painting an inaccurate picture of fraud. Some states, including Kobach۪s Kansas, have said they are legally prohibited from providing the commission with some of the sensitive information requested, such as the last four digits of voters۪ Social Security numbers. Kristen Clarke, the president of the Lawyers۪ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, immediately seized on Trump۪s tweet to urge states not to comply with the commission۪s work, which she called a sham.۝ Earlier this week, voting advocacy groups raised alarm after Trump appointed Hans von Spakovsky, a former Justice Department lawyer, to the commission. Von Spakovsky has long suggested widespread fraud is a problem and advocated more restrictive voting measures. Trump۪s Saturday tweet was the latest example of the president undermining the work of the White House on Twitter. After White House press secretary Sean Spicer insisted Trump۪s executive order on immigration didn۪t constitute a travel ban۝ earlier this year, Trump called it a travel ban in a tweet. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit cited Trump۪s tweet in a June ruling saying the ban was unconstitutional."

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-planned-parenthood-teen-abortion_us_59653229e4b09b587d63018a","NEW YORK ۥ Republicans are trying to find a way to defund Planned Parenthood as part of an overall effort to limit abortion in America. But doing so had the opposite effect in Texas, according to a new study based on research from Texas A&M University. The study, conducted by economics professor Analisa Packham (now at Miami University), shows that in the first three years after Texas Republicans slashed the family planning budget in 2011 and shut down more than 80 women۪s health clinics , the abortion rate among teenagers in the state rose 3 percent over what it would have been had the clinics remained open.After cutting Planned Parenthood out of the state۪s subsidized women۪s health program, then-Gov.Rick Perry (R) said his goal۝ was toʉ ensure abortions are as rare as possible under existing law .۝ But the move actually interfered with an overall downward trend in abortions in Texas. This certainly isn۪t the way to have fewer abortions,۝ said Dr. Diane Horvath-Cosper, an OB-GYN in Maryland and an advocate with Physicians for Reproductive Health. The abortion rates nationally have decreased and are at a historic low. So for Texans to see an increase in adolescent abortions is really telling ۥ it seemed to have followed the national trend until these clinics were defunded.۝ The greatest rises in abortion rates occurred in rural areas, where access to affordable family planning care was already scarce.In Gregg County, where the local health center lost 60 percent of its family planning funding, the abortion rate increased by 191 percent between 2012 and 2014 . The Austin American-Statesman reported that at least five counties in East Texas also saw considerable increases۝ in abortions over that two-year period. The overall abortion rate in the state dropped 14 percent between 2013 and 2016 ۥ but this was largely because in some low-income rural areas, like the Rio Grande Valley, women would have had to drive over 100 miles to find the nearest safe and legal abortion provider. Those women either had to seek out unsafe, do-it-yourself procedures or simply have babies they didn۪t want or couldn۪t afford. President Donald Trump and the Republicans in control of Congress now want to defund۝ Planned Parenthood nationwide by preventing Medicaid recipients ۥ who account for more than half of Planned Parenthood۪s patients ۥ from going there for birth control and cancer screenings. The Congressional Budget Office estimates this would cause 15 percent of women in rural areas to lose access to family planning care entirely, which in turn would lead to more unplanned pregnancies and likely more abortions. Studies show that 40 percent of unintended pregnancies end in abortion, so cutting access to birth control is not the way to reduce the overall abortion rate. Only a few moderate Republicans, like Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), seem to understand the flaw in this plan. If you۪re serious about trying to reduce the number of abortions ,۝ Collins told reporters in March , the best way to do that is to make family planning more widely available.۝ This article has been updated to reflect Packham۪s current academic position."

All year long, outlets parachuted reporters into Trump Country۝ to observe his voters in their habitatʉ Cletus safari۝ is the derisive term of art  and the reporters returned with tenderly crafted soft-focus portrait after tenderly crafted soft-focus portrait of people aching to say the n-word. Trump supporters are mad, reporters told us. Maybe you۪ve heard? They۪re mad at the establishment, they۪re mad at Democrats, and most of all, they۪re mad that they۪ve been left behind. (And of course a lot of them are mad at black people, and many even say as much, but we try not to talk about that part.) These stories were a sort of pornography. They existed less as a way of explaining the country to their audience than as a way for media outlets to gratify themselves, or perhaps to atone for the perceived sin of overlooking Trump supporters the year before. Some profiles offered insight; many more did not. But together, in their sheer bulk, they illuminated a larger story: the longstanding media habit of indexing the American political narrative to the sanctified yearnings of a narrow slice of white voter. Reagan Democrats, independent voters, the undecided,۝soft Republicans  no matter how small their number, no matter how wide the electoral margin,these groups always become the axis on which the story of every election turns.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/j20-inauguration-rioting-felony-charges-journalist-alexei-wood_us_5a0cb991e4b0c0b2f2f78aed","Editor۪s note: Taking a cue from Slate , this article describes an American news story  the virtually unprecedented prosecution of nearly 200 protesters on felony charges  using language the American media typically reserves for news stories written about more repressive countries. Felony charges against American journalists are jarring. Our approach to this story is meant to be as well. WASHINGTON  An American photojournalist swept up in a mass arrest of hundreds of demonstrators conducted by security forces in the nation۪s capital earlier this year during a protest of a regime change ceremony will face a criminal trial here Monday. Alexei Wood, a 37-year-old freelance photojournalist based in the American southwest, has been charged with multiple felonies. If found guilty, he could face decades inside a mammoth prison system in the world۪s most incarcerated nation. Wood was one of more than 200 citizens captured en masse by police forces quelling demonstrations held at the same time as President Donald Trump۪s inauguration. Just weeks before, the tough-talking real estate magnate and reality television star shocked the nation۪s political class when his rightward, populist campaign beat out that of a candidate from America۪s predominant center-left political dynasty. The continued prosecution of Wood and nearly 200 protesters has raised alarm among many who worry it will have a chilling effect on dissent in America, a country that holds itself up as a beacon of free speech and political expression. Trump۪s inauguration here on Jan. 20 sparked mass protest, much of which was peaceful.But police forces quickly moved in when members of a loosely organized far-left rebel group dressed in black smashed business windows in the capital۪s downtown. Later that day, some set fire to a limousine, which they viewed as a symbol of the country۪s elites. The unrest resulted in more than $100,000 of property damage, and several members of the security force sustained minor injuries. The protests have been referred to as the J20_ protests, short for the date. The demonstrations were organized by a group called DisruptJ20, whose website had been subject to search warrants that critics called a fishing expedition. In recent years, security forces in Washington, also known as the District of Columbia, have generally exercised restraint in their response to demonstrations, which are more common here in the nation۪s capital than in most parts of this vast country of more than 300 million people. But once property damage began on the day of Trump۪s installment, the Metropolitan Police Department responded to the demonstrations with significant force. They threw stinger grenades, fired pepper balls and sprayed chemical agents that are banned in warfare . Following the lead of police, prosecutors also responded aggressively, moving to charge protesters using a rarely invoked riot act, which holds members of an entire group responsible for the actions of a few. Wood is now among nearly 200 defendants who, if convicted on charges of rioting, conspiracy to riot, inciting others to riot, and multiple acts of property destruction, could potentially each be sentenced to over 60 years in prison. Though such extreme sentences are unlikely, human rights observers point to the aggressive prosecution of those rounded up during the demonstration as yet another excess of the American criminal justice system, which has come under increased scrutiny in recent years especially in regard to its treatment of ethnic minorities. Wood and five co-defendants will be the first of those arrested during the protests to go on trial, with the remainder of the cases scheduled in the coming months. The trials will pit two groups routinely demonized by Trump ۥ journalists and protesters ۥ against security forces the American law and order۝ president has sought to embolden both through his rhetoric and through official government policy . Over the past year, prosecutors cracked into at least eight of the cellphones confiscated from defendants, extracting some of their internet histories, communications and pictures to be used as evidence in court. In April, security forces with judicial branch approval broke into the D.C. home of one protest organizer ۥ a tactic more commonly associated with investigations of drug rings and criminal enterprises ۥ seizing thousands of dollars worth of personal property, including computers, cellphones and art supplies. Media advocates and civil rights groups are particularly alarmed by the continued pursuit of severe felony charges against Wood, an eccentric photographer and videographer who has described his beat as resistance cultures and conflicts۝ and has covered political unrest and sectarian violence across the country. Prosecutors had dropped charges against seven other journalists arrested that day, most of whom had connections to established media outlets. But the charges against two freelance journalists, Wood and Aaron Cant̼ , remain. Wood livestreamed his experience on Facebook, a 13-year-old social media network which initially catered to college students and now has a great influence over the country۪s political discourse. Wood۪s video will likely play a prominent role in the case against him and other protesters, and may offer some insight as to why prosecutors continued pursuing charges against him and not other journalists. In the video, Wood appears to express support for those engaged in destruction. In one part, Wood shouts wooo۝ as someone tries to smash the window of a bar called Maddy۪s Taproom. At another point, Wood appears to celebrate as a masked individual spray-paints revolution or death۝ on a garage door. We۪ve got some gra-fee-taaay,۝ he says, adding an approving wooo۝ as the spray painter finishes. Such expression, especially in support of property destruction, is widely considered unacceptable by the standards of American journalism, which typically encourages avoiding direct advocacy for political causes, and would be grounds for dismissal at most of the nation۪s mainstream outlets. But constitutional rights aren۪t exclusively for journalists in this 241-year-old democracy, and press advocates like the Committee To Protect Journalists say Wood۪s political utterances during his documentation of the event should not result in any charges, let alone severe felonies. The country۪s constitutional protections, in theory at least, are supposed to protect the right to peacefully assemble and express oneself in a country that holds itself up as a bastion of freedom. In interviews with HuffPost outside the aging, fortified courthouse, not far from the U.S. Capitol, Wood acknowledged his behavior that day might not sit well with other journalists, adding that he did nothing illegal. My professionalism is certainly up to be criticized, and I۪m open to it and I۪m welcoming of it,۝ he said. But I absolutely stand by that I did nothing illegal and I did nothing wrong.۝ He says he was there as a journalist and had been hoping to sell his photos. I went there to document,۝ he said. The United States generally has a better track record on press freedom than most other countries. But arrests of journalists across the nation have seemingly been more common in recent years, with the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker logging 31 arrests of journalists in 2017 alone. Just over three years ago, for example, one of the authors of this story was arrested by local police inside one of the country۪s ubiquitous McDonald۪s restaurants in the American Midwest, where he۪d been covering demonstrations that broke out after a police officer shot and killed an 18-year-old ethnic minority. The demonstrators were protesting the suburban security force accused of rampant discrimination and corruption. Law enforcement isn۪t the only threat, as journalists have also been targeted and subject to harassment at political rallies and demonstrations. Earlier this year, a politician from the American West body-slammed a reporter from The Guardian, shattering his glasses. Voters elected him anyway. Trump has been particularly vocal in his condemnation of journalists, calling them enemies of the American people.۝ His top law enforcement official, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a conservative from the American South, has declined to rule out jailing journalists and greatly expanded the number of federal investigations into leaks to the news media. Earlier this year, prosecutors even secured the conviction of a woman who laughed during Sessions۪ appearance before the country۪s legislative branch, though authorities declined to put her on trial yet again when a member of the judicial branch tossed out the conviction based on the government۪s misconduct. Trump۪s response to protests has skewed authoritarian over the past two years. As a presidential candidate, he routinely called on his supporters to engage in violence against anybody disrupting his rallies. But after a resurgent neo-Nazi and white supremacist movement held a pro-Trump rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August, which culminated in a neo-Nazi driving his car through a crowd of counterprotesters, killing one woman, Trump was slow to condemn his supporters, eventually blaming the violence there on both sides.۝ Wood۪s trial Monday will be held before District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Lynn Leibovitz, who was appointed by the second president in the conservative Bush political dynasty, factions of which have tried to distance themselves from the current de facto leader of the Republican Party, Trump. Leibovitz, a former homicide prosecutor during the 1990s when Washington was known as the nation۪s murder capital, is a widely respected official some consider  D.C.۪s toughest judge .۝ She once sentenced a 79-year-old demonstrator who۪d been arrested multiple times to 25 days in jail, and she thus far has denied defense motions to dismiss cases against the defendants who argued the capital city۪s rioting laws were too broadly written. Wood and his co-defendants appeared before Leibovitz in court last week, watching over the course of two days as members of the jury panel of D.C. residents came in to tell the judge and attorneys a bit about themselves. The trial is likely to stretch out over the course of four weeks. Quick in this case is going to be a relative term,۝ Leibovitz said in court last week. The case is being prosecuted by the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, which is part of the executive branch۪s Justice Department. In the nation۪s capital, the U.S. attorney plays a unique role in that the office prosecutes both federal crimes and local crimes, which means prosecutorial decisions are made by an appointee of the country۪s ruling party rather than a prosecutor chosen by local voters. The vast majority of this rapidly gentrifying city۪s residents, many of whom are employed within the American bureaucracy, oppose the country۪s ruling party. Several were removed from the jury due to their close connections to the government and law enforcement agencies ۥ one potential juror, for example, was quickly dismissed because her nephew was a D.C. police officer and was injured during the protest. Even if jurors don۪t convict Woods on any charges, the journalist said the prosecution has already taken a serious toll on him. Getting arrested was traumatic. The pepper spray was traumatic. Honestly the whole experience was traumatic,۝ he said. The machinery and the inhumanity of pretty much every single bit of it.۝ Wood, who lives over 1,600 miles away in San Antonio, Texas, said he۪s already had to attend numerous pre-trial hearings, and had to either fly or drive the distance each time. This security force۪s response to the Jan. 20 protests is currently being investigated by local authorities in Washington. The heavily armed police that day never warned protesters they could face arrest if they didn۪t disperse, as is required by the department۪s own policies. Instead, they surrounded the protesters, an aggressive policing technique known as kettling,۝ often used at protests over the police killings of unarmed African-Americans. A recent kettling۝ incident in the Midwest city of St. Louis swept up several journalists, and a member of the judicial branch found that the aggressive security force tactics there had likely violated the bedrock principles of American democracy. In Washington, protesters were trapped and deprived of food, water and bathroom access for hours before eventually being detained and arrested. The zip ties used to bind their wrists dug into their flesh, causing them to bleed. And for weeks after, some said their skin peeled from the pepper spray with which security forces had sprayed them. Journalist Shay Horse alleged in a lawsuit here that he and four protesters were subjected to cavity searches during their detention that could be considered sexual assault. The five men were forced to take off their pants, Horse said. An officer then grabbed the testicles of the five men, Horse alleges, before sticking a finger in each of their rectums, as other officers laughed. Horse said in a press conference earlier this year that it felt like police were using molestation and rape as punishment.۝ Although the city has since launched an independent investigation into how the protest was policed, few of the defendants have hope for real accountability. The organization hired by the city to conduct the investigation is a decidedly pro-police organization called the Police Foundation. Still, a dissident named Kris Hermes told HuffPost, If the investigation proves that people were unfairly arrested, what does that mean for people that have already been tried?۝ Hermes is a longtime legal activist affiliated with the National Lawyers Guild, which has been working with the defendants in this case. He۪s worried the charges against the defendants in this case are part of a government effort to crack down on protests. I think it۪s already sent a chilling message,۝ Hermes said. If all it۪s gonna take is people going on the streets and being near some property destruction or near people engaged in alleged criminal activity for them all to get felony charges, that۪s going to stifle free expression in the streets, and prevent people coming out and protesting when they have every right to do so.۝ Ryan Reilly reported from Washington.

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-daca-bannon-breitbart_us_59af0836e4b0354e440d62a3","WASHINGTON ۥ Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is still notching policy wins after his return to the right-wing website Breitbart. President Donald Trump۪s decision to end Obama-era protections for undocumented immigrants brought as children to the U.S. by their parents is a major victory for Bannon and Breitbart  and they know it. As Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced plans Tuesday to terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program with a six-month delay on enforcement, Breitbart۪s chief White House correspondent celebrated: This is a huge step in the right direction for the Trump administration, and for Breitbart as we cover the stories that most of the rest of the media ignore on immigration like crimes committed by illegal aliens including so-called Dreamers, the economic and cultural effects on American workers of large scale legal and illegal immigration, and the forgotten man and woman President Trump honed in on during the 2016 race and in his inauguration speech,۝ a senior Breitbart editor who was not authorized to speak on the record told HuffPost. Breitbart was a primary source of the push to repeal DACA, which covers approximately 800,000 people. The site has sometimes published multiple stories per day promoting repeal and praising DACA opponents , while attacking Democrats and Republicans who support the program. At one point on Tuesday, nine of the site۪s 10 most popular stories were about Trump۪s DACA repeal (or, in one case, about Hillary Clinton۪s DACA support ). It۪s no surprise that Breitbart sees a victory here: The site has served for years as the most prominent platform for anti-immigration organizations and politicians to promote their views. Breitbart۪s celebration also shows that the right-wing populist movement Bannon represents is still influential in the administration, even after Bannon۪s departure . Strong supporters of these policies remain in power: Sessions, who Bannon convinced to endorse Trump in 2016 , remains in charge of the Justice Department. Stephen Miller, a former Sessions aide, is the president۪s top domestic policy adviser. And former Breitbart writer Julia Hahn remains in the White House working on policy with Miller. Bannon can now provide them support from his perch at Breitbart. Trump۪s decision on DACA could result in a congressional push to pass legislation reinstating the program. But Breitbart is already planning to work to defeat any such legislative action, should it arise. Over the next six months as Congress considers whether to legislatively grant amnesty to the 800,000 plus illegal aliens that Obama illegally granted DACA executive amnesty to, we will be vigilant in how we cover and expose any career politicians who run counter to the will of the American voting public and the citizens of this country who very clearly stated in November 2016 that amnesty in any form is not acceptable public policy,۝ the senior Breitbart editor told HuffPost. The idea of a fight against congressional Republicans who favor immigration reforms that would legalize undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. dovetails with Breitbart۪s larger political mission of remaking the Republican Party. The news organization, particularly under Bannon, is openly hostile to both House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). In 2013, Bannon, Sessions and Miller, then a staffer for Sessions, successfully joined forces to beat a bipartisan immigration reform bill. Bannon and Miller teamed up again in 2014 to orchestrate the shock defeat of then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.). Cantor۪s support for immigration reform, and the backing he received from Wall Street donors who supported the policy, were the main issues that brought him down. Breitbart now backs former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore in the special Republican Senate primary runoff election against Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.), who was appointed to fill the seat Sessions left when he became attorney general. This position puts the site at odds with Bannon۪s former boss, Trump, who endorsed the incumbent Strange in early August. Just as it did in Cantor۪s race, the website has dispatched reporter Matt Boyle to cover the final weeks of the contest. One such dispatch favorably compares Moore to Sessions , noting that their respective positions on immigration and trade are no different. The Moore-Strange primary fight is only a piece of the larger battle Breitbart is waging. The big fight is to oust Ryan from his position as House speaker and replace him with a congressman more favorable to the Breitbart agenda. Axios reported on Tuesday that Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who heads the conservative House Freedom Caucus, met with Bannon and Boyle at Breitbart۪s offices in Washington on Monday to discuss the caucus۪ plans to take control of House leadership. Meadows appeared the next day as a guest on Breitbart۪s radio show , hosted by Boyle, to tell listeners how they should pressure Ryan, House Republican leadership and their own representatives. Meadows laid out the big fights to come on the debt ceiling and the budget, and urged Breitbart followers to press their lawmakers to oppose linking a debt ceiling increase to Hurricane Harvey relief funds. He called on listeners to tell lawmakers only to pass a government funding bill that would defund sanctuary cities and Planned Parenthood and include money for Trump۪s border wall, and to put a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare on the president۪s desk. If they do that, we will hopefully avoid this bloody September,۝ Meadows concluded. Matt Fuller contributed reporting."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/daca-dreamers-bill-trump_us_59af2533e4b0b5e53101d1bd","WASHINGTON ۥ Lawmakers on Capitol Hill broadly agreed on Tuesday that something should be done about young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and who will eventually lose deportation protections if Congress does not step in to help them. But Republicans are already placing conditions on their support that could kill the effort entirely. They are willing to vote for protecting so-called Dreamers۝ ۥ but not without getting something in exchange for it. Hopefully there will be some give and take and we can accomplish something,۝ Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said, suggesting Democrats could support efforts to boost border security. President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that his administration rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program , with enforcement to begin in six months. That time period gives Congress time to pass its own measures to allow undocumented young people to stay in the country, something that a majority of Americans support. Most Republicans in Congress have previously opposed such measures. A majority of them voted against past versions of the Dream Act, a stand-alone bill that would provide legal status to young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Some GOP senators voted for a comprehensive immigration reform bill that included measures for Dreamers in 2013, but also would have increased border security and included other enforcement measures. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), one of the sponsors of the current iteration of the Dream Act, argued during a press conference on Tuesday that lawmakersʉdon۪t have that luxury right now۝ of taking the time to pass another comprehensive bill, given the six-month time limit. Only four Republicans are currently co-sponsoring the Dream Act: Graham, Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Cory Gardner (R-Colo.). Gardner announced his support on Tuesday evening. Another possibility for stand-alone legislation is the Recognizing America۪s Children Act, or RAC Act, that Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) plans to introduce in the Senate soon.The RAC Act in the form already introduced in the House would grant legal status to certain young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. at age 15 or younger before 2012; the 2017 Dream Act would be open to individuals who came before the age of 18 and were in the U.S. since four years prior to the bill taking effect. Tillis indicated on Tuesday that his bill is meant to pass on its own ۥ he told reporters that although we need border security measures, it۪s a different bill going through Congress.۝ The bottom line of it is, I don۪t think DACA as a clean bill can get through the Congress by itself,۝ Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said in a call with reporters on Tuesday, according to Politico. He added that this was an opportunity for compromise between people that want DACA plus a lot of other things dealing with legal immigration, and I suppose even some things dealing with illegal immigration, that can probably be packaged together.۝ Some Republicans want to pair protections for Dreamers with cutting legal immigration, which Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) is pushing through in a bill called the RAISE Act . That legislation ۥ which has nothing to do with Dreamers ۥ was the only specific measure that Trump or Attorney General Jeff Sessions mentioned on Tuesday while announcing the DACA decision. The RAISE Act would face opposition not just from Democrats, but some Republicans as well. Trump hasn۪t actually said what he specifically wants Congress to do about Dreamers, although the White House previously indicated he wouldn۪t sign a stand-alone bill like the Dream Act. I have a love for these people and hopefully now Congress will be able to help them and do it properly,۝ the president said on Tuesday afternoon. And I can tell you, speaking to members of Congress, they want to be able to do something and do it right. And really, we have no choice, we have to be able to do something, and I think it۪s going to work out very well.۝ Even if enough Republicans ultimately come out in support of a stand-alone Dream Act, it۪s no sure bet that all Democrats would join them. Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), who helped defeat a similar measure in 2013, said Tuesday he opposed the president۪s ill-informed۝ decision to rescind DACA. But the vulnerable red state Democrat, who is facing a tough re-election fight in 2018, would not say whether he would vote to provide legal status to Dreamers in the future. I don۪t know. It depends on what it is,۝ Tester said, adding that Congress now had an opportunity۝ to tackle comprehensive immigration reform, which he supports. Democrats are unlikely to compromise on funding Trump۪s border wall, some said. But they might be willing to accept other measures. Graham, when touting the Dream Act, noted that his Democratic colleagues had voted for border security and enforcement measures as part of the 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill. In order to get 68 votes in the Senate, I swallowed hard,۝ Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the top champion of the Dream Act, said at the press conference with Graham of the 2013 bill. I۪ve been open to border security issues, I continue to be open to them. The wall, though, is a wall too far.۝"
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-911-anniversary_us_59b67625e4b0354e4413182b","WASHINGTON ۥ President Donald Trump on Monday commemorated the 16th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks,leading a moment of silence at the White House to mark the moment the first plane struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York. The president and first lady Melania Trump stood on the White House۪s South Lawn amid a crowd that included Trump۪s elder daughter, Ivanka, and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. Trump spoke at a memorial ceremony at the Pentagon later Monday morning, honoring the nearly 3,000 victims of the attacks and their families. Today, our entire nation grieves with you,۝ he said, reflecting on the horror and anguish of that dark day۝ and praising the country۪s perseverance and unity following the attacks. His measured remarks on Monday notwithstanding, Trump has a history of making insensitive and false comments about the Sept. 11 tragedy. The 2001 terrorist attacks were the subject of one of Trump۪s most egregious lies during his presidential campaign. In November 2015, he claimed, without evidence, that thousands and thousands۝ of Muslims in New Jersey had celebrated the news of the attacks. I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down. And I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down,۝ Trump said at a campaign rally. Thousands of people were cheering.۝ The following day, Trump reiterated his lie, claiming that the supposed celebration was well covered at the time.۝ There were people that were cheering on the other side of New Jersey, where you have large Arab populations. They were cheering as the World Trade Center came down,۝ Trump said on ABC۪s This Week.۝ The lie, which has been roundly debunked , appeared to originate from an article published a few days after the attacks , reporting that law enforcement officials had investigated a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river.۝ But Trump, as he frequently does, exaggerated the allegation in the story ۥ an allegation that was never substantiated. Following the rally in which he first peddled the lie, Trump mocked one of the journalists who wrote the original story , veteran New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, after Kovaleski himself affirmed that the story did not back up Trump۪s lie. I certainly do not remember anyone saying that thousands or even hundreds of people were celebrating,۝ Kovaleski said. In response, Trump performed a disgusting imitation of Kovaleski, who has arthrogryposis, a congenital joint condition. On the actual day of the attacks, Trump, a New York real estate mogul, tastelessly bragged about his downtown Manhattan building, 40 Wall Street. Calling in to a New York TV news broadcast, as the station aired footage of the World Trade Center towers collapsing, Trump claimed that his property would now become the tallest building in the area. 40 Wall Street actually was the second-tallest building in downtown Manhattan, and it was actually, before the World Trade Center, was the tallest  and then, when they built the World Trade Center, it became known as the second-tallest,۝ he said. And now it۪s the tallest.۝ That claim also turned out to be false . Trump has frequently referred to the attacks on Twitter , his favorite medium of communication. In 2011, he claimed that he۪d foreseen the attacks. And on the anniversary of the attacks in 2013, he tweeted his best wishes to all, even the haters and losers, on this special date.۝ This article has been updated to include Trump۪s remarks at the Pentagon ceremony."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anthony-scaramucci_us_597234d1e4b0e79ec198f98c","Coiffed, in a crisp blue suit, gesticulating and speaking about his love for the administration, the president, the president۪s agenda and the president۪s alleged ability to throw a sweet football spiral, Anthony Scaramucci did his best on Friday to signal that a new era of the White House press office had begun. I want to thank personally Sean Spicer,۝ Scaramucci said at the beginning of his first press conference as White House communications director. I love the guy and I wish him well, and I hope he goes on to make a tremendous amount of money.۝ Scaramucci, a former Wall Street financier, mentioned his own business experience several times during the press conference,and was quick to dismiss any suggestion from reporters that Donald Trump ۪s presidency is somehow off course. I think the ship is going in the right direction. We۪ve just got to radio-signal the direction clearly,۝ Scaramucci said. I love the president and I۪m, very, very loyal to the president.۝ Trump shook up his beleaguered press team on Friday, appointing Scaramucci, a close ally of his in recent months, to the post he now holds. The move was reportedly what led White House press secretary Sean Spicer to resign Friday after just six months on the job. Spicer isn۪t alone in his disapproval of Scaramucci. Spicer۪s deputy, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, as well as White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and chief strategist Steve Bannon all reportedly opposed Scaramucci۪s appointment, multiple outlets reported Friday . But the president۪s daughter Ivanka, his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross were supportive of the appointment, according to The New York Times . So who is Anthony Scaramucci, and why did Trump select him for the role? The 53-year-old Harvard Law graduate is a former Goldman Sachs banker, a longtime Republican donor and a Trump campaign loyalist who was part of the president۪s transition team. Scaramucci was previously said to have been tapped for a different role in the administration, within the White House۪s public liaison office. But that appointment was sidelined, in part, over potential ethical conflicts related to the sale, which had not yet been completed, of SkyBridge Capital, an asset-management business he founded, to a division of a Chinese conglomerate. Instead Scaramucci took a job as senior vice president and chief strategy officer for the U.S. Export-Import Bank. He was recently at the center of controversy after CNN was forced to retract a story about his alleged connections to a Russian bank. Three of the journalists who worked on the article resigned. Following the retraction, Scaramucci said CNN did the right thing,۝ declaring: Apology accepted.۝ But the episode also got the attention of the president, who tweeted in celebration of the retraction . Scaramucci has also become a vocal defender of the president on cable news ۥ but that wasn۪t always the case. In August 2015, before it was clear Trump would emerge as the Republican nominee for president and win the election, Scaramucci called Trump another hack politician۝ during a Fox Business Network segment in which Trump criticized hedge fund managers. Scaramucci called Trump۪s criticisms anti-American۝ and very, very divisive.۝ He also predicted Trump would lose the election. I۪ll tell you who he۪s going to be president of ۥ the Queens County bullies association,۝ Scaramucci said then. You۪re an inherited-money dude from Queens County. Bring it. This sort of nonsense is going to cause him to eventually implode. Bashing the hedge fund community is right out of the Elizabeth Warren playbook. Are you a Democratic plant for Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren?۝ When a panelist reacted to Scaramucci۪s criticism, saying she didn۪t like the way Trump talked about women, he agreed. I don۪t like the way he talks about women, I don۪t like the way he talks about our friend Megyn Kelly... He۪s got a big mouth,۝ Scaramucci said. He has also voiced opinions on policy that appear to run counter to those of the president. In 2013, Scaramuci called Mitt Romney a true statesman۝ for saying that Russia was a legitimate threat to American interests. Trump has favored a warmer relationship with Russia, despite an ongoing investigation into allegations that the Russian government meddled in the 2016 election. More recently, Scaramucci has apparently fallen in line with the president۪s wild theories on various issues. In 2016, Scaramucci tweeted , The fact many people still believe [climate change] is a hoax is disheartening.۝ Later that year, though, he appeared to backtrack, saying  there are scientists that believe that [climate change] is not happening .۝Though the vast majority of climate scientists insist climate change is real and caused by human activities, Trump and many other elected Republicans claim global warming is a  hoax .۝ In February, during a wave of bomb threats against Jewish community centers and day schools across the country,Trump floated an unfounded theory that the threats may have been committed  to make others look bad .۝ On that same day, Scaramucci implied in a tweet that Democrats may have been behind the threats. And at Friday۪s White House presser, when asked about the president۪s false claim that millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 election, Scaramucci said: If the president says it... my guess is there۪s probably some level of truth to that.۝ Scaramucci also speaks about the president not unlike how Trump speaks about himself. He۪s the most competitive person I۪ve ever met,۝ Scaramucci said Friday. I۪ve seen this guy throw a dead spiral through a tire. I۪ve seen him at Madison Square Garden with a topcoat on, he۪s standing in the key and he۪s hitting foul shots and swishing them. He sinks three-foot putts. I don۪t see this guy as a guy that۪s ever under siege. The president۪s a winner and what we۪re going to do is we۪re going to do a lot of winning.۝ This article has been updated with details from Friday۪s press conference."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/secret-service-trump-tower-dispute_us_5983a08ce4b041356ebee1b8","It looks like the Secret Service has been kicked to the curb. The Washington Post reports that a lease dispute has forced the agency to move its Trump Tower command post out of the building, where it had been one floor below President Donald Trump ۪s apartment, and into a trailer on the sidewalk. After much consideration, it was mutually determined that it would be more cost effective and logistically practical for the Secret Service to lease space elsewhere,۝ a Trump Organization spokesperson confirmed to HuffPost. Trump has not spent a night inside the building since his inauguration, although first lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, continued to live at the property until they moved to the White House in June . The U.S. military also leases space inside the building under a separate arrangement that costs $130,000 per month , the Wall Street Journal reported last month. Earlier this year, Congress approved $120 million to cover some of the costs of protecting the president and his family , with half of the money going to the Secret Service. The agency has faced significantly increased costs as it tries to keep up with a president who spends many of his weekends at one of several different residences. In the first three months of the year, the Secret Service spent $35,000 just on golf cart rentals at the Trump-owned Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, CBS News reported. It۪s not clear what the specific source of the current dispute is, and the agency told The Hill that  there has been no impact to the security plan ۝ as a result of moving the command post. Last year, Trump was criticized for raising the price inside his building for a space he leased to his campaign, nearly quintupling the rent when he stopped self-funding and began soliciting donations.

I thought we probably went too far on [helping] corporations.۝ The senator believes the bill ۥ which is projected to add $1.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade unless it can offset those losses via economic growth ۥ probably won۪t result in multinational corporations investing their sudden windfall in hiring and expanding. Instead, it۪s more likely to line the pockets of their shareholders. By and large, you۪re going to see a lot of these multinationals buy back shares to drive up the price,۝ Rubio predicted. Some of them will be forced, because they۪re sitting on historic levels of cash, to pay out dividends to shareholders.۝ That isn۪t going to create dramatic economic growth,۝ he said. Despite the fact that public opposition to the bill was widespread , with 35 percent of Americans in favor and 55 percent of Americans opposed, Rubio said he doesn۪t think it will hurt Republicans in the 2018 elections. _(People۪s) opinion today is based on what they۪ve read and what they۪ve been told it does,۝ he said. But if I۪m against the tax bill because I don۪t think it۪ll actually cut my taxes and I get my first paycheck in February and it has $200 in there that didn۪t used to be there, I۪m going to notice that.۝"
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-mccain-health-care-graham-cassidy_us_59c2d7ebe4b06f93538c3e5b","WASHINGTON ۥ The fate of health care for millions of Americans may, once again, come down to Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). It was McCain in July who sank Republican hopes of a  skinny repeal ,۝ siding at the last minute with Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) to vote against the Senate GOP۪s scaled down health care bill. At the time, McCain said he was voting no because of the bad process that Republicans had used to bring up the bill, where they skipped committee hearings, markups and amendments to just put the legislation up for a vote with a less than solid idea of the policy effects. Now McCain is making a similar argument. I want regular order,۝ McCain told HuffPost on Wednesday, a chorus he has repeated over and over again this week. When asked if that meant he was still a no, McCain said, I want regular order, is the answer.۝ It۪s a less than clear answer, but it۪s one that McCain has shown he is serious about, and if he truly intends to demand a process close to regular order,۝ McCain could be the deciding Republican once again in sinking the GOP۪s newest health care plan. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell۪s office told reporters Wednesday that it was the Kentucky Republican۪s intention۝ to bring up this bill ۥ authored by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) ۥ for a vote next week. Republicans only have until Sept. 30 to get this bill through the House and Senate before the legislative vehicle they۪re using expires. (Republicans are using a fiscal 2017 budget resolution to try to pass their health care legislation through reconciliation, a process that only requires 51 votes in the Senate, with the help of Vice President Mike Pence breaking a tie.) After Sept. 30th, Republicans could use another budget resolution to pass their bill, meaning this proposal wouldn۪t necessarily be dead at the end of the week, but the whole process would take more time, and the Congressional Budget Office will likely be able to score the legislation before lawmakers vote on the bill. As it stands now, Senators intend to vote on the Graham-Cassidy bill with only a  preliminary ۝ CBO score ۥ one that won۪t have a complete analysis on the legislation۪s effect on premiums, deficits or how many people would end up losing health insurance as a result. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) looks resolute in voting against the Graham-Cassidy proposal. Collins is likely to follow suit, though she hasn۪t definitively said she۪s a no. Murkowski also still appears to be leaning no, telling reporters that she۪s still unprepared to support the bill. Murkowski is clearly a key vote , and one that Republicans almost certainly needs to pass their bill. But GOP leadership is making changes for Alaska in a bid to win her over. Cassidy has projections he۪s been passing around to his Senate colleagues, and his latest spreadsheet shows Alaska getting extra money from the bill ۥ a change that hasn۪t been reflected in the legislation but is coming, according to what Cassidy staffers told Business Insider . If Murkowski is bought off, and if Paul and Collins hold strong, this process will all come down to McCain, who will have to choose between his legacy and Graham, his best friend in the Senate. When HuffPost asked McCain this week if it was weighing on him that he might have to sink Graham۪s legislation, McCain said it was  difficult ,۝ but he reiterated yet again that he was more concerned about regular order. I don۪t want to have to just vote aye or no on what۪s one-fifth of the gross national product,۝ McCain said. While it may seem laughable to most that a friendship might so clearly impact a bill, the bond between McCain and Graham is very real and very strong ۥ almost certainly stronger and more real than any other bond between two senators today. I always do whatever Lindsey Graham tells me to do,۝ McCain told reporters last week, only half-kidding. But McCain seems to have concerns other than friendship since he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer over the summer. When he returned to the Senate in late July, he said he wouldn۪t support the Senate GOP۪s health care proposal because it penalized his home state of Arizona and was opposed there by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey. Ducey has since found a way to support this latest proposal , even though Arizona is one of the states that loses money under the proposal, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities . The secret to the Graham-Cassidy legislation, at least in the first 10 years, is that it picks some winners and some losers among states. Graham even admitted as much on Tuesday when he told reporters that some big blue states,۝ like California and New York, would be hit with huge cuts. I۪m not out to hurt them,۝ Graham said. But I۪m trying to make ۥ you know, create parity here.۝ Neither Graham nor Cassidy is being entirely truthful about how many states actually end up losing . For one, after 2026, the Medicaid block grants in the bill end, meaning that if the money isn۪t reauthorized, states could face a funding crisis. Republicans are also misleading people about the effects of the legislation on people with pre-existing conditions. Cassidy has been fighting with late-night host Jimmy Kimmel and traded barbs over Twitter with NPR over claims that the legislation would raise prices on people with pre-existing conditions ۥ which it would ۥ and Cassidy started a press conference on Tuesday by touting how his legislation would lower premiums on the parents of disabled children, a claim that is dubious at best and brazenly dishonest at worst. McCain has the power to actually demand the truth. He can say he won۪t vote for this bill until it receives a full CBO score ۥ a key tenet of regular order for a bill that is advancing under budget reconciliation. And he can demand real hearings, ones with real health policy experts and real answers. All McCain has to do is keep insisting on the regular order that he says he wants, and not give in to leadership or his good friend Graham when they press him to bend on his principles and just vote yes.

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-jr-russia-email_us_59642625e4b09b587d617ff2","Donald Trump Jr. was told in an email that a meeting to obtain information damaging to presidential rival Hillary Clinton was connected to intelligence gathered by the Russian government to help elect his father, according to a report published in The New York Times on Monday. The Times, citing multiple people with knowledge of the missive, said the email was sent by Rob Goldstone, a publicist who helped set up the meeting during the 2016 presidential campaign between Trump۪s eldest son and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. The note reportedly said the information presented during the meeting would come from the Russian government. Mark Corallo , the spokesman for President Donald Trump ۪s personal lawyer, told The Guardian the president was not aware of and did not attend the meeting۝ between his son and Veselnitskaya. In a statement provided to HuffPost, Trump۪s newly hired lawyer, Alan Futerfas ,confirmed the existence of an email between his client and Goldstone but said it was much ado about nothing.۝ During this busy period, Robert Goldstone contacted Don Jr. in an email and suggested that people had information concerning alleged wrongdoing by Democratic Party front-runner, Hillary Clinton, in her dealings with Russia,۝ he said in the statement, first provided to The Times. Don Jr.۪s takeaway from this communication was that someone had information potentially helpful to the campaign and it was coming from someone he knew. Don Jr. had no knowledge as to what specific information, if any, would be discussed.۝ Monday۪s revelations came after a weekend of intense reporting on the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower. The New York Times first reported on the meeting between Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya on Saturday. Trump Jr. said at the time that the meeting, which was also attended by his brother-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his father۪s then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, had centered on the Magnitsky Act . (The 2012 act allowed the U.S. to withhold visas and freeze Russian assets. In retaliation, the Kremlin halted U.S. adoptions of Russian babies.) But on Sunday, Trump Jr. admitted in a statement that he had met with Veselnitskaya after being told she might have information helpful to the campaign.۝ Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense,۝ Trump Jr. said. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.۝ On Twitter, Trump Jr. defended his decision to accept the meeting, saying he had to listen۝ when someone approached him about information that could help his father۪s campaign. Obviously I۪m the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent... went nowhere but had to listen,۝ he wrote. In a separate message, he rejected claims that he provided two different explanations about why he attended the meeting, saying he  simply provided more details .۝ But Monday۪s revelation sheds new lights on the meeting and is notable for several reasons. As MSNBC۪s Ari Melber noted, the email could be a crucial piece of evidence in any investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow to sway the 2016 election in Trump۪s favor. The note could back up assertions from U.S. intelligence agencies that Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to influence last year۪s election , but it could also indicate that Trump۪s inner circle was willing to accept the meeting despite knowing that a foreign government was involved. Legal experts have said Trump Jr.۪s behavior could be illegal, as campaign finance laws prohibit political candidates and their associates from obtaining anything of value to aid their campaign from foreigners. Common Cause, a nonpartisan watchdog group, filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission on Monday asking for an investigation into the meeting. He did in my view violate the prohibition on soliciting a contribution of a foreign national,۝ Paul S. Ryan, a campaign finance expert at Common Cause, told HuffPost۪s Marina Fang. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders rejected any claims of collusion involving Trump Jr. She told reporters Monday that the only evidence of impropriety was the people that leaked the information on the meeting after it was voluntarily disclosed.۝ Don Jr. did not collude with anybody to influence the election,۝ Sanders said at an off-camera briefing at the White House. Don Jr. took a very short meeting from which there was absolutely no follow-up.۝  This article has been updated with added details and a statement from the spokesman for Donald Trump۪s personal lawyer ."
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-jr-attorney-client-privilege_us_5a289d5fe4b03ece03000e48","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump ۪s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. , declined to discuss with lawmakers on Wednesday a conversation he had with his father about emails related to a June 2016 meeting he attended with Trump associates and Russians, a congressional panel member said. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee investigating allegations of Russian interference in last year۪s U.S. election, said Trump Jr. answered the overwhelming majority۝ of questions from committee members in his hours of testimony. But Trump Jr. claimed attorney-client privilege in declining to respond to queries about that discussion with his father because a lawyer was in the room when it took place. The discussion between then-Republican candidate Trump and his son took place after the emails became public, Schiff said. Trump Jr. released the emails in July. In my view there is no attorney-client privilege that protects a discussion between father and son,۝ Schiff told reporters after the closed-door testimony had ended. We will be following up with his counsel,۝ Schiff said. Representative Mike Conaway, the Republican leading the investigation, said Trump Jr. had answered all of his questions. Mr Trump was cooperative at all times,۝ Conaway said. Trump Jr. arrived and left without being seen by reporters. Lawmakers said they want to question him about a meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016 at Trump Tower in New York at which he had said he hoped to get information about the fitness, character and qualifications۝ of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democrat who was his father۪s presidential election opponent. It was at least the second time Trump Jr. has testified to a congressional committee investigating any Russian meddling in the election and possible collusion with Moscow by the Trump campaign. He arrived shortly before 10 a.m. EST (1500 GMT) and was questioned for most of the next eight hours by members of the intelligence panel. A person familiar with knowledge of Trump Jr۪s testimony said Trump had said repeatedly he did not remember things he was asked about, including some details about information provided by Russians during the Trump Tower meeting. Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller is also investigating. He has announced the first charges of Trump associates, and Trump۪s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, has pleaded guilty to lying to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents. The House intelligence panel also released on Wednesday a transcript of testimony last week of Erik Prince, a Trump supporter and founder of the Blackwater military contractor. A focus of that testimony was a report that Prince tried to set up a back channel۝ for communications between Trump associates and Russia. Prince denied such a plan. REPUBLICANS CRITICIZE PROBES Trump Jr.۪s appearance coincided with criticism of the Russia probes from some of his father۪s fellow Republicans, who control both houses of Congress and accuse investigators of bias against Trump. Other lawmakers, Republicans as well as Democrats, say the goal of the investigations is to guarantee the integrity of U.S. elections, not to target Trump and his associates. Trump Jr., like his father, denies collusion with Russia. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia attempted to influence the 2016 campaign to boost Trump۪s chances of defeating Clinton. Moscow denies any such effort. Some Republicans criticized Mueller, the FBI and the Department of Justice at a news conference on Wednesday, ahead of congressional testimony on Thursday by the director of the FBI, Christopher Wray. Republican House members accused the Justice Department and the FBI of bias against the president and having been too easy on Clinton during the investigation of her use of a private email server while leading the State Department. However, Clinton has made no secret of her belief that then-FBI Director James Comey۪s announcement just before the election that the bureau was investigating potential new evidence in the lengthy email probe cost her the White House. Also on Wednesday, Representative Bob Goodlatte, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, announced a hearing next week with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, citing serious concerns۝ about reports on the political motives of staff on Mueller۪s team.

Trump announced on Friday he was pardoning Joe Arpaio, an anti-immigration hardliner found guilty last month for flouting a 2011 court order that barred officers from detaining Latino motorists solely on the suspicion they were illegal immigrants. Law-enforcement officials have a special responsibility to respect the rights of everyone in the United States. We should not allow anyone to believe that responsibility is diminished by this pardon,۝ Ryan said in a statement. The speaker does not agree with the decision,۝ Ryan۪s spokesman Doug Andres said. Some other prominent Republicans, including Arizona Senator John McCain and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, have also criticized Trump for the controversial pardon. Arpaio, 85, was an outspoken supporter of Trump۪s presidential campaign and both men have argued for tougher policies against illegal immigration. As president, Trump has broad powers to issue pardons and he had said Arpaio was convicted for doing his job۝. Arpaio lost his own bid for re-election in Arizona۪s Maricopa County in November, after 24 years in office."

In one of a series of Monday morning tweets, the president wondered why the various investigations into Moscow۪s election interference were not looking into Crooked Hillarys [sic] crimes & Russia relations.۝ Trump singled out our beleaguered A.G.۝ Jeff Sessions, who previously recused himself from the Russia investigations, citing his role in Trump۪s campaign, and after failing to disclose meetings with then-Russian ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak. Shortly after Sessions recused himself, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosentein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to lead a wide-ranging probe. Trump said last week that he would not have appointed Sessions had he known the attorney general would recuse himself. Jeff Sessions takes the job, gets into the job, recuses himself, which frankly I think is very unfair to the president,۝ he told the New York Times in an interview. How do you take a job and then recuse yourself? If he would have recused himself before the job, I would have said, Thanks, Jeff, but I۪m not going to take you.۪ It۪s extremely unfair  and that۪s a mild word  to the president.۝ Trump۪s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, eldest son Donald Trump Jr., and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort are all set to face closed-door questions from congressional investigators this week concerning their contacts with Russian officials during the campaign. Trump۪s tweet on Monday appeared shortly after a segment on Fox & Friends۝ about a similar topic. The president frequently tweets about the Trump-friendly morning news program. Just after 7:30 a.m. on Monday morning, former Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), now a Fox News contributor, wondered why Republicans were not continuing to investigate the Clinton family for alleged improprieties. There is a double standard with the United States Senate Republicans because they are holding [the Trumps]to a much higher standard, with very little evidence, than they ever did the Clintons,۝ the former House Oversight Committee chairman said on the show. That investigation  why did it end?۝ In a subsequent tweet Monday morning, Trump described the Russian investigations an excuse۝ by Democrats for losing the election, and called Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee who is leading one of the probes, sleazy۝ and totally biased.۝ Trump then shifted to tweeting about Senate Republicans۪ ongoing effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, saying that they have a last chance to do the right thing.۝ Over the last several weeks, Trump has maligned and in some cases personally targeted GOP lawmakers for failing to pass a health care bill."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/walter-shaub-jr-ethics-director-resign_us_5925d9fae4b0265790f49277","WASHINGTON ۥ Walter Shaub Jr., who announced Thursday that he will resign as director of the Office of Government Ethics , told CBS News that President Donald Trump ۪s businesses present the appearance۝ of profiting from his tenure in the White House. Reporter Julianna Goldman asked Shaub , Do you think the president and his family are using the office to enrich themselves?۝ I can۪t know what their intention is,۝ Shaub answered. I know that the effect is that there۪s an appearance that the businesses are profiting from his occupying the presidency. And appearance matters as much as reality. So even aside from whether or not that۪s actually happening, we need to send a message to the world that the United States is gonna have the gold standard for an ethics program in government, which is what we۪ve always had.۝ Shaub added that it almost doesn۪t matter۝ if the Trump family is or isn۪t making financial gains. America should have the right to know what the motivations of its leaders are, and they need to know that financial interests, personal financial interests, aren۪t among them,۝ he said. The clip below, which aired Thursday evening, is part of a longer interview with Shaub. CBS News will run another portion on Friday morning. Shaub is planning to join the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit that works on voting rights and campaign finance issues. His resignation, effective July 19,marks the culmination of a months-long battle between the federal government۪s top ethics official and Trump, who once promised to drain the swamp۝ of corruption in Washington. In his resignation statement, Shaub appeared to be sending a message to the White House.He quoted federal law , praising ethics officials for their commitment to protectingʉthe principle that public service is a public trust , requiring employees to place loyalty to the Constitution, the laws, and ethical principles above private gain.۝ Shaub said he was not pressured to resign, according to The New York Times . The White House said itʉaccepts Mr. Shaub۪s resignation and appreciates his service.۝ The statement added that the President will be nominating a successor in short order.۝ The Office of Government Ethics, which was created in the wake of the Watergate scandal, typically works closely with presidential administrations to resolve possible conflicts of interest. But Shaub, who joined the ethics office as an attorney during the George W. Bush administration and was appointed director by Barack Obama, struggled to connect with the Trump transition team after the election. At one point, he resorted to sending out a series of desperate-sounding tweets to get Trump۪s attention. Trump announced in January that he would give control of his business empire to his adult sons, becoming the first president in the modern era to refuse to divest or separate himself from holdings with potential conflicts. Shaub sharply criticized the plan for failing to meet the standard that every president of the past four decades has met.۝ In his CBS News interview, Shaub also addressed the claim by Trump lawyer Sheri Dillon at a January press conference that if Trump sold off his assets, that  would greatly diminish the value of the assets and create a fire sale .۝ I have no sympathy for that,۝ Shaub told CBS. He۪s in a position where he۪s going to have to send young men and women to die in combat, potentially, or risk their lives at least. They۪re paying a much higher price. So no, it۪s not too much to ask for somebody to incur a bit of a financial loss if they have to sell things off.۝ Shaub, whose term was set to end in 2018, persisted in trying to do his job under the Trump administration, becoming something of an unlikely bureaucratic hero . When White House counselor Kellyanne Conway urged Fox News viewers to buy products from Ivanka Trump۪s fashion line in February  a pitch that appeared to flagrantly violate federal ethics rules  Shaub told the White House that disciplinary action was warranted. (The White House didn۪t follow his advice .) Trump also nominated people with enormously complex financial holdings to key Cabinet positions. Reince Priebus, Trump۪s chief of staff, tried to publicly blame Shaub۪s office for the slow rate at which the White House was filling key positions. But Shaub noted that some of the Trump administration۪s nominees pushed back against the government۪s ethics requirements with a ferocity we۪ve not previously seen.۝ Another clash with Shaub۪s office came after it directed officials in April to release information about ethics waivers that may have been granted to former lobbyists working in the Trump administration. Instead, the White House questioned the OGE۪s legal authority to request the information and sought to stay the inquiry. (The OGE does not conduct investigations or have enforcement power.) This action drew a lengthy response from Shaub , who declined to suspend the ethics inquiry, calling the requestʉhighly unusual.۝ Shaub said that he didn۪t believe there was much more I could accomplish at the Office of Government Ethics, given the current situation,۝ according to The New York Times , and that the timing was right for his departure.His new position with the nonprofit group, he reportedly said, will allow him to openly advocate for government ethics reforms. Trump will have the opportunity to appoint a new OGE director and shape the office in his image, a move that is sure to trouble Democrats worried about conflicts of interest in the Trump administration.

It happened,۝ an aide to a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee told HuffPost on Monday. The White House later confirmed the news. Mr. Petersen has withdrawn his nomination and the President has accepted,۝ a White House official told HuffPost. In his letter to the president, Petersen said he۪s withdrawing because he doesn۪t want to be a distraction۝ to the administration. I had hoped that my nearly two decades of public service might carry more weight than my two worst minutes on television,۝ he said. However, I am no stranger to political realities, and I do not wish to be a continued distraction from the important work of your Administration and the Senate.۝ Requests for comment from Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, also were not returned.A request for comment from Petersen was not immediately returned. Trump nominated Petersen, who is currently a member of the Federal Election Commission, to be a lifetime judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. But Petersen۪s lack of qualifications were painfully on display last week as Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) asked him about his courtroom experience. KENNEDY: Have you ever tried a jury trial? PETERSEN: I have not. KENNEDY: Civil? PETERSEN: No. KENNEDY: Criminal? PETERSEN: No. KENNEDY: Bench? PETERSEN: No. KENNEDY: State or federal court? PETERSEN: I have not. Peterson also could not explain basic legal terms, when pressed by Kennedy. KENNEDY: As a trial judge, you۪re obviously going to have witnesses. Can you tell me what the Daubert standard is? PETERSEN: Sen. Kennedy, I don۪t have that readily at my disposal but I would be happy to take a closer look at that. That is not something I۪ve had to contend with. KENNEDY: Do you know what a motion in limine is? PETERSEN: Yes... I haven۪t, I۪m, again, my background is not in litigation as when I was replying to Chairman (Chuck) Grassley (R-Iowa), I haven۪t had to um, again, do a deep dive. Petersen is Trump۪s third district court nominee to get derailed over a lack of qualifications. Brett Talley, a 36-year-old lawyer who had never tried a case and earned a rare and unanimous not qualified۝ rating by the American Bar Association, withdrew his nomination last week. Jeff Mateer, who had described transgender children as evidence of Satan۪s plan,۝ is not moving either. These are embarrassing setbacks to Trump۪s otherwise successful push to fill up federal courts with his lifetime judges. The Senate confirmed 12 of his circuit court judges this year, more than any president has gotten in their first year since those courts were created in 1891. That۪s in addition to putting Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court and getting six district court nominees confirmed. It doesn۪t sound like the president cares if a few of his nominees go down. Kennedy told local news affiliate WWL-TV on Monday that Trump called him Saturday to talk about Petersen and said he agreed with Kennedy۪s criticisms that his nominee wasn۪t qualified. He doesn۪t interview these guys, he has his staff do it,۝ said the Louisiana Republican. He said, Kennedy, I think you۪re right.۪۝ Kennedy said Trump has also told him that he۪s counting on senators to reject his bad judicial picks. He has told me, Kennedy, when some of my guys send someone who is not qualified, you do your job,۪۝ the GOP senator said.

Trump tweeted about Clinton۪s involvement in the matter in mid-October ,and renewed his suspicion on Sunday morning in a series of tweets . The truth behind the deal is much more complex than what Trump has tweeted. Uranium One was a Canadian company with mining operations in the United States, and the sale of those mines had to be approved by a nine-member committee in Congress. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States had to unanimously agree to the deal. If the sale was to be stopped, it would have to come from then-president Barack Obama. Years later, a New York Times report revealed that the Clinton Foundation received donations from Uranium One investors during the proposed sale, sparking controversy. When Kerns tried to blame Clinton on air Sunday morning, Reid refused to let the claim go unchallenged. We۪re not going to get derailed, but I want to ask you a few fact-based questions,۝ Reid said on the show. Take a look: Reid continually peppers Kerns with questions about the deal, leading Kerns to admit that Clinton had no direct involvement in the approval, and that the foundation donor had sold his shares in the company prior to giving money to the Clinton organization. _So what you۪re talking about is a deal that nine members of CFIUS approved unanimously,۝ Reid said on the show.

The council, which still had 16 members, was completely dismissed with a letter sent through FedEx on Wednesday, the Washington Blade first reported. Current members of Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS (PACHA) received a letter informing them that the Administration was terminating their appointments۝ on Dec. 27, 2017, Hayes told HuffPost in a statement sent via email. They were also thanked for their leadership, dedication and commitment to the effort. Changing the makeup of federal advisory committee members is a common occurrence during Administration changes,۝ the statement read. Six members of the council had earlier resigned in June due to  a president who simply does not care ,۝ according to one member in a Newsweek op-ed entitled Trump doesn۪t care about HIV. We۪re outta here.۝ One source with knowledge of PACHA told the Washington Blade that  many council members were terminated even though additional time remained on their terms as advisers. ۝ PACHA is a federal advisory committee created in 1995 with the goal of providing information, advice, and recommendations to the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services regarding programs, policies, and research to promote effective treatment, prevention, and cure of HIV disease and AIDS.۝ As of September, President Donald Trump signed an executive order renewing PACHA for an additional year so the move to fire the current council without explanation seems brash. One of those members ۥ Gabriel Maldonado, CEO of the Riverside, Calif.-based LGBT and HIV/AIDS group Truevolution ۥ told the Washington Blade, however, that it is common for appointees to be terminated and for folks to kind of want their own people in.۝ I think where the discrepancy comes in is why a year later, No. 1? Two, many of us, our terms were over earlier this year and we were sworn back in, and three were stayed on nearly four months after an executive order was signed continuing the council,۝ he said. Also of note, during the Obama administration, nearly all of George W. Bush۪s appointees were eliminated prior to new appointees being named. The current administration has not appointed a director of the Office of National AIDS Policy, a major reason contributing to the June resignation of the six members of PACHA. Additionally, the ONE Campaign released a report earlier this year on the potential impact of the White House۪s proposed $800 million cut to HIV/AIDS efforts. The cut would slash the President۪s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief by 17 percent and gut global health programs by $2 billion , according to CBS News. The impact would be so great that AIDS experts and advocates predicted to the publication that it would upend progress on curbing the epidemic.۝ On World AIDS Day,the Department of Health and Human Services published a notice in the Federal Register inviting nominations of members to serve on PACHA.

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/charlottesville-right-wing-extremism_us_5994c097e4b06ef724d629ad","WASHINGTON ۥ The death of 32-year-old anti-racist protester Heather Heyer at the hands of a white supremacist on Saturday was the most recent of at least 65 fatal incidents perpetrated by right-wing extremists in the United States since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The incident in Charlottesville is indicative of how far-right extremist violence has surged in the intervening years,as federal law enforcement efforts have shifted attention toward the threat posed by jihadist terrorism, former counter-terrorism officials and experts say. Conservative media and Republican politicians who oppose federal crackdowns on far-right extremist ideologues encouraged this shift, and presidents from both parties have acquiesced to the pressure. This process has only accelerated since the inauguration of President Donald Trump , who defended the white nationalist and white supremacist protesters who marched in Virginia, by saying there were some good people among them and equating them with anti-racist counter-protesters. The president and his aides support gutting efforts to counter violent extremism stemming from white supremacy and other racist ideologies in order to divert funding to anti-jihadist measures. The administration has already cut funding to the group Life After Hate , which works to rehabilitate white supremacists. There۪s been a clear signal by this administration that they don۪t want to spend any money or resources on countering white terrorism,۝ Daryl Johnson, who led a Department of Homeland Security task force focused on domestic extremism and terrorism from 2004-2010, told HuffPost. The Trump administration۪s effort to de-emphasize the threat of domestic right-wing terrorism is part of a trend: Over the past 16 years, presidents from both parties have redirected law enforcement resources away from monitoring right-wing extremists to focus on groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda. At the same time, violent incidents, including murders, committed by far-right extremists continued to rise. Studies from the University of Maryland , New America Foundation , Southern Poverty Law Center , Combating Terrorism Center at West Point and the Department of Homeland Security highlight the continued danger of right-wing domestic terrorism. Prior to the attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando , right-wing extremist attacks had killed more Americans than extremist attacks by Muslims in the years since 9/11. It۪s a major mistake, in my view, to defund programs and efforts which help to expose and reform white supremacists,۝ said Todd Blodgett, a conservative Republican and former FBI source who worked undercover in white supremacist extremist groups. It required effort to brainwash these bigots, and effort is needed to get them out of the realm of racist hatred. Having worked for Ronald Reagan and the first President Bush, including in the White House, I know they۪d agree.۝ But the shift in resources wasn۪t entirely attributable to the understandable fear of a repeat of the 9/11 attacks. Right-wing radio , Fox News , and Republican Party lawmakers fought a years-long campaign against efforts by federal law enforcement to monitor right-wing extremists and prevent them from turning violent. Blodgett points to the reaction and ultimate retraction of a 2009 Department of Homeland Security report on the increasing threat of right-wing extremist terrorism. That report was written by Johnson and his small team at DHS that monitored and countered violent extremism from domestic, non-jihadist sources. The team, constituted during the George W. Bush administration, included individuals monitoring white supremacists, anti-abortion extremists, animal rights activists, environmental terrorists and other domestic groups. Its 2009 report concluded that the economic collapse and the election of the first African-American president could fuel a surge in recruitment for white supremacist groups and lead to an uptick in violence. The report also warned that right-wing extremist groups sought to recruit returning veterans of the of the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But as a result of conservative outrage, DHS gutted Johnson۪s team , cut the number of people investigating domestic extremism, canceled briefings for state and local law enforcement and blocked the release of more reports on domestic extremist groups. The department has never reconstituted that effort,۝ Johnson told HuffPost. There was nothing in that report that was wrong,۝ Blodgett said. It was wrong of [the Obama administration] to be cowed by the groups putting pressure on them over that. As a card-carrying Republican conservative I can tell you this, this kind of stuff has got to be drummed out of any coalition that is part of any Republican campaign.۝ A 2012 report by Arie Perliger for the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point came to the similar conclusion that far-right terrorism was on the rise. It too was denounced by conservative media. In the ensuing years, right-wing extremist violence jumped, just as predicted by Johnson۪s DHS report. According to the New America Foundation , 10 people were killed by far-right terrorist violence from 2001 through 2008. Since then, right-wing extremists have murdered 55 people in violent attacks in the U.S. Since DHS ended its program, federal law enforcement actions related to domestic right-wing extremism now primarily rest with the FBI and the Joint Terrorism Task Force, although both organizations have limited resources devoted to these efforts. Nonetheless, DHS and the FBI in May issued a joint bulletin warning about the potential threat of violence from right wing extremists, according to Foreign Policy . Michael German, a former FBI undercover agent and now a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice۪s Liberty and National Security Program, felt that the 2009 report overemphasized the way in which the ideology of right-wing groups turned individuals violent rather than attracting individuals who were looking for a justification for their desire to commit acts of violence. Still, German says that the coordination between federal and local enforcement ۥ a recommendation of the report ۥ could improve, particularly in the wake of recent white supremacist and white nationalist protests in cities that have devolved into violent battles and near riots with little police supervision. It۪s not just the violence the nation saw in Charlottesville, but also right-wing protests in Berkeley, Sacramento, Portland and Huntington Beach, where police took a hands-off approach. In Portland and Huntington Beach , police even allowed the right-wing protesters to arrest۝ counter-protesters and drag them over to the police. That is extremely dangerous,۝ German said. To give these groups the idea that their violence is sanctioned by the state will make them far more violent and far more dangerous in the long run. Not to mention the failing to police these running street battles will encourage them to come to the next protest prepared.۝ The comments made by the president in defense of certain attendees of the violent white supremacist protest in Charlottesville suggest his administration will not put pressure on law enforcement groups to changes focus, especially as administration aides continue to openly dismiss the threat posed by far-right extremism. White House adviser Sebastian Gorka recently pushed aside concerns that white supremacist extremists are a problem in the U.S. It۪s this constant, Oh, it۪s the white man. It۪s the white supremacists. That۪s the problem.۪ No, it isn۪t,۝ he said on Breitbart News Daily , a radio show from the media company that used to employ him. You have the issue of Trump kind of pandering to these groups during his election campaign and taking some of their ideas and mainstreaming them into his policies,۝ Johnson said.

On Wednesday night, the new White House communications director, responding to a Politico story about his finances, claimed his financial disclosure form had been leaked.

Trump on Sunday tweeted what appeared to be an edited version of a 2007 clip of him beating up WWE founder Vince McMahon, with CNN۪s logo replacing McMahon۪s face . It was then retweeted by the president۪s official White House account, @POTUS, following a week of renewed attacks against CNN and other news outlets, which Trump has branded as fake news۝ and fraudulent.۝ What about GOP leaders? What about Republican leaders?۝ CNN media reporter Brian Stelter asked Sunday about responses to the tweet. Where۪s [House Speaker] Paul Ryan? Where۪s [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell? Are GOP leaders going to speak up about these attacks against the media?۝ As of Sunday evening, neither Ryan nor McConnell۪s offices had responded to HuffPost۪s requests for comment on Trump۪s tweet. Trump۪s behavior and outbursts ۥwhich likely would have sunk the political careers of anyone else ۥ have spurred GOP criticism in the past . But the party۪s leaders have done little to try to stop him, and have remained supportive of his presidency . The latest example came last week, after Trump attacked MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski in a series of sexist tweets . Republicans on Capitol Hill responded with various iterations of concern . They have also frequently lamented that Trump۪s tweeting habits distract from the GOP۪s legislative agenda. But their day-to-day dealings with Trump go on, seemingly unaffected by the controversies. Trump has time and time again undermined the free press, which has galvanized opposition to the media among his supporters . During his White House campaign, he regularly incited protests and violence against reporters at his raucous rallies. As president, he and his administration have embarked on an anti-media crusade, keeping the press and the public in the dark , sometimes on even basic matters. Trump۪s treatment of the media has prompted press freedom groups to lower America۪s ranking in their global assessments of press freedom, with some equating the level of press freedom in the U.S. to that of authoritarian nations. Still, White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Thursday falsely insisted the president in no way, form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence,۝ as she defended Trump۪s tweets targeting Brzezinski.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/summer-zervos-subpoena-donald-trump-sexual-assault_us_59e3a30de4b03a7be5816360","A woman who accused President Donald Trump of unwanted groping has subpoenaed all documents held by his presidential campaign about any harassment and assault allegations against him, BuzzFeed News reported Saturday . Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice۝ and one of many women who came forward during the campaign to accuse Trump of harassment or assault, initiated the subpoena as part of her lawsuit against the president for defamation. Zervos decided to sue Trump in January months after the then-presidential candidate denied the allegation and dismissed all of his accusers as liars. In her bid to establish that Trump defamed۝ her, Zervos۪s subpoena aims to prove how Trump deliberately tried to discredit her and the other accusers. The subpoena, which is liable to renew public attention on the numerous allegations against Trump, sets the stage for another legal and political headache for the president. Zervos۪ subpoena requires him to turn over all documents concerning any accusations that were made during Donald J. Trump۪s election campaign for president, that he subjected any woman to unwanted sexual touching and/or sexually inappropriate behavior.۝ The order would cover documents about Zervos, as well as other women who accused Trump of groping, including, but not limited to, Jessica Leeds, Mindy McGillivray, Rachel Crooks, Natasha Stoynoff, Temple Taggart, Kristin Anderson, Cathy Heller, Jill Harth, and Jessica Drake. Zervos۪ legal team, which includes nationally renowned women۪s rights attorney Gloria Allred, issued the subpoena in March, but it only entered the court record in September. Trump۪s attorneys tried to get the suit dismissed in March on the grounds that the president is immune from being sued while in office. They also tried to dismiss the subpoena in July, arguing that it seeks wholly irrelevant information intended solely to harass the president.۝ During Trump۪s campaign, he vowed to sue the women who accused him of assault and harassment, but he has not followed through on the promise. The subpoena comes to light at a moment of heightened public sensitivity to the impunity given to many powerful men allowing them to sexually harass and assault women. Famed Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was fired by the company he founded and expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences after the New York Times reported earlier this month that Weinstein had settled numerous accusations of sexual harassment out of court. The report prompted a flood of additional allegations against Weinstein, including claims that he physically assaulted women and forced them to perform sex acts. The allegations against Weinstein bear an eerie resemblance to the accounts of many Trump accusers. At least 16 women have publicly accused Trump of forcibly attempting to kiss, grope and have sex with them. Many of those women came forward in October 2016 following the leaked 2005 video of Trump bragging to Access Hollywood۝ host Billy Bush that he freely touches women without their consent, infamously stating that he can grab them by the pussy.۝ Zervos said that in 2007 Trump summoned her to meet about professional matters on several occasions and then kissed, groped and humped her against her will."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jerry-moran-mike-lee-senate-health-care_us_596d594ce4b0e983c05877f4","WASHINGTON Just like that, the Republican mission to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act has failed again. And like its other near-death experiences since President Donald Trump took office, backed by total GOP control of Congress at the beginning of this year, the decisive factors were the party۪s lack of vision of what the health care system would look like ۥ and a lack of conviction about owning the consequences of undoing a law that had extended health insurance to tens of millions of Americans. Barack Obama isn۪t around to blame anymore, and Democrats wield virtually no power in Washington. The inability of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to rally 50 of 52 Republican senators stems entirely from internal strife. Regrettably, it is now apparent that the effort to repeal and immediately replace the failure of Obamacare will not be successful,۝ McConnell said in a statement published on Twitter. At the end of this latest stage in the short, troubled, deeply unloved life of the Senate health care bill , it was two Republicans from the conservative wing of the Senate who struck the damaging blow. Four Republican senators are now on record as opposing the measure: Jerry Moran of Kansas, Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky on the conservative side, and Susan Collins of Maine from the moderate۝ camp. McConnell could afford to lose just two votes. Passing that threshold could lead to a flood of other Republican senators announcing their opposition. Monday evening ۥ the day McConnell originally wanted to begin floor proceedings on the Better Care Reconciliation Act ۥ Moran and Lee announced their opposition to the Senate Republican health care bill , dealing a serious and possibly crippling blow to the GOP۪s effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act . Republican lawmakers, and their voters, continue to support repeal, however, so the final outcome of this debate has yet to occur. And it was just a few short months ago that repeal appeared dead in the House only to be revived weeks later when the lower chamber passed a bill similar to the Senate legislation . Trump reacted to Moran۪s and Lee۪s defections by renewing his call for the Senate to repeal the Affordable Care Act outright and pass a replacement for the law at a later date, an option that is supported by few Republicans. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), leader of the conservative Freedom Caucus, demanded the same in a Twitter post . Full repeal would require 60 votes to overcome a Democratic filibuster in the Senate, however. Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now & work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in!۝ Trump posted on Twitter . Republicans in Congress, and Trump himself, rejected this so-called repeal-and-delay strategy , however, early in the year. And Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana already are developing an alternative health care proposal. Collins, who previously worked with Cassidy on another approach, has called for Senate Republican leaders to work with Democrats on a narrower measure to improve the Affordable Care Act. One thing that may prove more resilient than the Republican repeal effort may be the law the party is trying to destroy. Since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in March 2010, it۪s been the subject of an unending campaign of opposition and obstruction. It۪s also had real and significant failings that have frequently overshadowed its accomplishments . The majority-conservative Supreme Court had opportunities to gut the law in 2012 and 2015, and declined both times, although its first ruling limited the scope of Obamacare۪s Medicaid expansion by enabling red states to refuse to participate. Backlash to the law contributed to the GOP takeover of Congress and its growing majorities in both chambers. And Trump۪s victory in November looked as though it might seal the Affordable Care Act۪s fate. For now, at least, the law is in less danger than it has been since Nov. 7 . On Monday , Moran and Lee declared they would vote no on the motion to proceed۝ ۥ a procedural step necessary to begin formal debate on legislation and, eventually, to pass it. The two senators complained that the bill didn۪t repeal enough of the Affordable Care Act, and they criticized the secretive, hurried process McConnell employed in an attempt to advance the legislation before opposition could coalesce. McConnell can continue trying to win over the holdouts by offering to change the bill ۥ something he has been trying to do, with middling success, for the last few weeks. But the opposition of Lee, in particular, suggests that McConnell۪s task will be even more difficult than it seemed just a day ago. In addition to not repealing all of the Obamacare taxes, it doesn۪t go far enough in lowering premiums for middle class families; nor does it create enough free space from the most costly Obamacare regulations,۝ Lee said in a statement . The regulations Lee has in mind are the ones guaranteeing coverage to people with pre-existing conditions and requiring that all plans include a comprehensive set of benefits ۥ regulations that have made coverage available to people who could not get it before but have also raised premiums and forced some people to pay more for their insurance than they did previously. Moran۪s statement focused on similar themes. There are serious problems with Obamacare, and my goal remains what it has been for a long time: to repeal and replace it. This closed-door process has yielded the [Better Care Reconciliation Act], which fails to repeal the Affordable Care Act or address healthcare۪s rising costs. For the same reasons I could not support the previous version of this bill, I cannot support this one.۝ We should not put our stamp of approval on bad policy,۝ Moran said. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that an earlier version of this bill would result in 22 million fewer people having health coverage over the coming decade and would reduce federal Medicaid spending by more than 30 percent . And health insurance companies strongly warned that new provisions added to the legislation last week at the insistence of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), which would۪ve permitted insurers to go back to rejecting people with pre-existing conditions , were simply unworkable in any form.۝ This was in addition to strong opposition from organizations representing physicians , hospitals and other health care providers and patient groups. But it was those humanitarian objections that sent the Senate health care bill to its death bed. Collins cited coverage losses as part of her reason to vote against the bill, but Moran, Lee and Paul instead protested that the measure left too much of the law۪s consumer protection rules and financial assistance in place. Other Republican senators, most notably Dean Heller of Nevada, also bemoaned the health care bill۪s effects on Medicaid and how many individuals it would leave without insurance. But neither Heller, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) or others who have expressed such misgivings actually came out against the legislation. It was widely assumed that McConnell۪s strategy was to do something like House Republican leaders did in May, when they finally passed their legislation: shore up support among conservatives, then win over enough moderates to assemble a majority. If the Cruz amendment isn۪t enough to satisfy Lee, then the only way to gain his support (and perhaps Moran۪s support as well) would be to weaken those regulations even more. That would almost certainly alienate less-conservative members of the GOP caucus, many of whom have already warned that the bill takes away coverage from too many people. It also doesn۪t help that the regulations Lee wants to eliminate happen to be highly popular ۥ or that high-ranking Republicans, including President Donald Trump , pledged repeatedly to keep those insurance protections in place. Before Moran and Lee came out against the bill, McConnell delayed a vote on the legislation again after Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) announced he would not be able to vote this week while recovering from surgery . Republicans have struggled to pass a health care bill, so far failing to deliver on a much-hyped 2016 campaign promise that the GOP would repeal Obamacare. Trump has repeatedly pressed Republicans to pass legislation. He even hosted GOP senators at a dinner at the White House on Monday in an attempt to discuss the bill with lawmakers who were on the fence about whether to vote for the legislation. Earlier Monday, Trump emphasized how crucial McCain۪s vote would have been to passing the bill. We hope John McCain gets better very soon because we miss him,۝ Trump said at an event Monday. He۪s a crusty voice in Washington. Plus, we need his vote.۝ Protests against the bill have been a regular sight on Capitol Hill in recent weeks, with many demonstrators being placed under arrest.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/net-neutrality-good-bad_us_5a396d07e4b0860bf4ab9e6f","WASHINGTON ۥ The repeal of net neutrality isn۪t great news for consumers. Giant internet service providers that control their own media empires will be able to push you toward their content while serving up their rivals۪ content at molasses-slow speeds. Consumers could be driven into walled content gardens where what you read and watch will be partly determined by which company provides your internet service. That۪s probably bad for you. But it would be good for us. HuffPost is owned by a company called Oath, which in turn is owned by Verizon, one of the three largest internet service providers in the U.S. Oath was created after Verizon purchased AOL in 2015 and Yahoo in 2017 and combined them into one media corporation. It owns a wide range of media properties, including HuffPost, Yahoo News, TechCrunch, Engadget, Yahoo Sports and Tumblr. And now, absent the regulatory protection of net neutrality, Verizon and other internet service providers can favor our content while discriminating against the competition۪s. Verizon did not respond to a request for comment.The company wasn۪t the first internet service provider to build a media empire, and it may not be the last  ISPs and tech companies have been acquiring content providers like HuffPost for decades. The television revolution that began half a century ago spawned a number of industries, including the manufacturing of TV sets, but the long-term winners were those who used the medium to deliver information and entertainment,۝ Microsoft CEO Bill Gates wrote in a 1996 essay published just after Microsoft and NBC joined together to create MSNBC. Content,۝ Gates declared, is king.۝ The trend spread. Comcast purchased NBCUniversal in 2011. AT&T announced an $85 billion purchase of Time Warner in 2016  a merger that is now being challenged by the Department of Justice . AT&T was aiming to build an empire,۝ The New York Times declared .More deals of similar size and scope could be on the horizon. Because of this sort of consolidation, much more of the internet  and access to it  is dominated by just a handful of companies, less than even a few years ago. Soon those internet service providers that have vertically integrated media empires will be able to operate much like the old closed system of television  controlling both the production of media and the means of distributing it, warned Mitch Stoltz, a senior attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. What the customer is presented with is what۪s convenient and easy to find,۝ Stoltz said. And where your eyes and ears get steered comes more and more under control of the [internet service provider].۝ In other words, major ISPs will be able to promote the media companies they own  like this one  while punishing competitors۪ offerings. That will force consumers, who often have no choice in internet service providers, into walled gardens of content that the ISPs create. Some Democrats are now questioning whether the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission need to step in and redefine the terms by which ISPs can own media companies. Prior to the FCC۪s vote to kill net neutrality, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) asked the Justice Department to open an investigation into Comcast۪s purchase of NBCUniversal in 2011 and consider separating Comcast and NBCU in order to fully restore competition.۝ That merger came with specific conditions, set to expire in February, that included a promise to abide by the principles of net neutrality. [G]iven that the FCC is on the brink of reversing its Open Internet Order, it is all the more imperative for the Justice Department to ensure fair competition in this space,۝ Blumenthal wrote. Without rules to protect consumers and govern how internet providers treat their competitors, Comcast-NBCU will be free to discriminate against online video distributors, which is exactly what DOJ is trying to avoid and is precisely what the merger conditions are meant to address.۝ But even in the unlikely event that Blumenthal and his ilk succeed in breaking up vertically integrated ISPs or bringing back net neutrality, their victory won۪t be complete. After all, the ISPs aren۪t the only huge companies creating walled gardens: Silicon Valley giants followed Gates۪ 1996 vision and created their own media empires, too. Today, Amazon has its own television and film studio, a distribution platform for its Prime Video offerings and hardware to deliver it in its Amazon Fire television device. Google owns YouTube, the largest online video platform, and manufactures Chromecast, streaming television hardware. Facebook has its own ambitions to produce video content for distribution through its platforms and apps. Apple has its Apple TV device and streaming video options available through iTunes. These Silicon Valley firms are, even more than ISPs, the most dangerous vertically integrated institutions,۝ argued Matt Stoller, a senior fellow at the Open Markets Institute, a nonprofit that backs vigorous antitrust enforcement. And like ISPs, these firms are likely to benefit from the repeal of net neutrality rules. Companies like Amazon are already hard-wired into the backbone of the internet at the service providers۪ data centers , and it is likely that their market position will improve as competitors will find it even more difficult to challenge them. This fact has been a convenient cudgel for net neutrality opponents. Since Amazon, Google and Facebook aren۪t governed by net neutrality principles, Verizon, Comcast and AT&T shouldn۪t be either, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a former Verizon lawyer and leading net neutrality foe, argued before the final vote to repeal the rules on Dec. 14. Fortunately for net neutrality advocates, fighting the balkanization and walling-off of the internet doesn۪t require picking between the ISPs and the Silicon Valley giants. Regulators and politicians could crack down on both. There۪s some support for that idea, too: Soon-to-be former Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) called for net neutrality rules for companies like Facebook and Google just last month. No one company should have the power to pick and choose which content reaches consumers and which doesn۪t,۝ Franken said. Facebook, Google and Amazon, like ISPs, should be neutral in their treatment of the flow of lawful information and commerce on their platform.۝ In the meantime, if you get your internet from Comcast, AT&T or Charter, we apologize in advance for the extra seconds it might soon take to load this website.

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-russia-lawyer_us_59624746e4b0615b9e922779","White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus has accused Democratic operatives of arranging a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Kremlin-linked lawyer last summer, two weeks after Donald Trump won the Republican nomination for president. The meeting, which included Jared Kushner and Trump۪s then-campaign manager Paul Manafort and took place at Trump Tower in Manhattan, came to light in an investigation published Saturday in The New York Times . Trump Jr. defended the summit, which he said focused on Russian child adoption policies. On Sunday, Priebus said the individual that set up the meeting may have been۝ associated with Fusion GPS, the Washington, D.C.-based strategy firm behind a leaked intelligence dossier that suggested Russian officials possess materials that could be used to blackmail President Trump . Trump۪s Republican rivals in the primary funded the opposition research at first, but it was later continued with backing from the Democrats. There۪s more questions on the Democrat side than anywhere else,۝ Priebus said on Fox News Sunday.۝ He pointed to an article on Circa , the news site owned by the right-wing media giant Sinclair Broadcast Group, which cited a spokesman for Trump۪s legal team. The story was splashed on Drudge Report on Sunday morning. We have learned from both our own investigation and public reports that the participants in the meeting misrepresented who they were and who they worked for,۝ Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Trump۪s lawyers, said in a statement published by Circa. Specifically, we have learned that the person who sought the meeting is associated with Fusion GPS, a firm which according to public reports, was retained by Democratic operatives to develop opposition research on the President and which commissioned the phony Steele dossier.۝ Priebus brushed off the meeting as a very short meeting,۝ lasting about 20 minutes. But asked for details, he demurred. I have no idea, Chris, you۪re going to have to talk to them,۝ Priebus told host Chris Wallace, referring to Kushner, Trump Jr. and Manafort. However, talking about issues of foreign policy, issues related to our place in the world, issues important to the American people, like adoption, is something that۪s not unusual.۝ But, just hours later, another report from The New York Times cast doubt over the narrative Priebus spun. According to the report, which cites three White House advisers and two others briefed on the meeting, Donald Trump Jr. met with the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, after being promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton, then the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. The meeting, the report noted, represented the first public indication that the Trump campaign was willing to accept help from a Kremlin-linked individual. In a statement, Trump Jr. admitted to meeting with the lawyer after learning she may have a tip about the Clinton campaign, but said she offered nothing of value and instead used claims of potentially helpful information۝ as a pretext for a meeting about Russian adoption issues. Here statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense,۝ he said in a statement given to ABC News after the Times report published. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.۝ Manafort resigned from the Trump campaign last August amid reports that he worked with pro-Russian forces in Ukraine. The extent of his ties to Russian interests became clearer later, with reports as recently as last month revealing that he received more than $17 million over two years working for a pro-Kremlin party. Manafort remained in contact with the president after his resignation, and reportedly advised the White House on how to deal with the ballooning Russia scandal. In May, The New York Times reported that Kushner faced scrutiny in the F.B.I. probe into Russian hacking of the 2016 election. Kushner allegedly tried to circumvent diplomatic channels to open a direct line between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The revelation on Saturday could drag Trump Jr., a loud cheerleader for his father۪s administration, into the investigation. On Sunday, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said he may push Trump Jr., who runs the Trump Organization with his brother, to testify before the committee. We are going to want to question everyone at that meeting about what was discussed,۝ he said on CNN۪s State of the Union.۝ This story was updated to include the follow-up report published Sunday by the Times."

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/carl-icahn-trump-resigned_us_59999fede4b0a2608a6cd1aa","Billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who resigned as President Donald Trump۪s special adviser on regulations on Friday , did so just hours before The New Yorker magazine published a critical article that detailed his potential conflict of interest and questioned whether he had acted illegally. Icahn, an early endorser of Trump۪s presidential bid and longtime acquaintance, said in a letter he was resigning from the adviser۪s post because he did not want partisan bickering۝ to distract from the president۪s agenda. He also denied any conflict of interest, stating that heʉnever had access to nonpublic information or profited from my position.۝ The New Yorker, however, reported on Friday that Icahn had been pushing to overturn an environmental regulation the investor considered onerous and one that had been costing him hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Under the rule in question, passed by Congress during President George W. Bush۪s administration in order to promote biofuels and renewable energy, oil refineries are required to blend ethanol into their products, or, alternatively, to purchase credits known as Renewable Identification Numbers. Icahn in 2012 bought a controlling stake in one such refinery, Texas-based CVR Energy, whose business had depended on buying so-called RINs. Their cost had fluctuated so much by 2016, however, that it had seriously depressed the company۪s stock price. Several weeks after Trump۪s victory last November, Icahn was named as an adviser to the president and CVR۪s stock doubled on the expectation that the regulation would be repealed, according to The New Yorker. In February, news leaked that Bob Dinneen, who runs the Renewable Fuels Association, a leading ethanol trade group, had struck a deal with Icahn to change the ethanol blending requirement. The development surprised observers and industry experts because the association had long opposed such a change, the magazine said. Dinneen told The New Yorker that Icahn had told him that Trump would change the rule through executive order whether or not the ethanol lobbyist objected. Dinneen agreed to the change because he apparently felt that his only option was to secure whatever concessions he could for his industry,۝ according to the magazine article. Trump administration officials denied that any such ethanol executive order was in the works. But one official, speaking anonymously to The New Yorker, said the draft of such an order was something Icahn sent to us.۝ The suggested order was never acted upon, according to the administration officials, in part because changing the congressionally approved regulation is a complex process. But the episode raises questions as to whether Icahn had used his position inappropriately; whether, as The New Yorker puts it,Icahn thought that he could bluff his way to a change in federal regulation.۝ In his statement on Friday, Icahn stressed that he did not use his title and association with the president for personal gain. Indeed, out of an abundance of caution, the only issues I ever discussed with you were broad matters of policy affecting the refining industry,۝ he wrote to Trump. I never sought any special benefit for any company with which I have been involved, and have only expressed views that I believed would benefit the refining industry as a whole.۝ Richard Painter, who served as the Bush administration۪s ethics lawyer from 2005-2007, suggested to the magazine that the Justice Department۪s public-integrity division investigate Icahn۪s actions as a Trump adviser. If he was advising on a matter where he had an interest, then Icahn was in direct violation of the criminal statute,۝ Painter said. Read the whole story at The New Yorker ."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/graham-cassidy-jimmy-kimmel_us_59c2783ce4b0f22c4a8e0e8f","Hours after a brutal takedown at the hands of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel , Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) went on television Wednesday to respond. But with literally his first sentence, Cassidy did the very thing that had drawn Kimmel۪s ire: The senator made wildly misleading claims about his controversial bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. There will be more people covered under the Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson amendment than are under status quo and we protect those with pre-existing conditions,۝ Cassidy said during an appearance on MSNBC۪s  Morning Joe .۝ That statement, similar to one Cassidy also made on CNN , is virtually impossible to defend. The Graham-Cassidy proposal, which Republicans are rushing to take up for a floor vote next week, calls for reducing federal spending on health care through two sets of changes. First, the bill would convert the Affordable Care Act۪s coverage expansion money into a set of direct grants to states ۥ grants that would start in 2020 and, critically, would expire after 2026. Second, the bill would make a permanent change to Medicaid financing, affecting even parts of the program serving traditional Medicaid groups like poor children and the disabled. Over time, that change would reduce Medicaid۪s funding relative to current law. By design, the sum total of all those state grants would be less than the federal government would spend on health care if the Affordable Care Act remained in place. The difference would be $215 billion, from 2020 through 2026, according to a study from Avalere Health that happened to go public on Wednesday morning. Previous estimates, from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , suggested the funding decline would be even greater. After that, the cuts would get much larger, because of the expiration of those state grants. Between 2026 and 2036, one decade later, the reduction in expected federal spending on health care would be more than $4 trillion, Avalere found. Cassidy has said Congress would likely reauthorize the program۪s spending before it expires, but there are no guarantees it would. At that point, the parliamentary and political obstacles to making such a new expenditure would be considerable, while the uncertainty of ongoing federal support would likely lead states to shrink their own programs beforehand. Avalere also broke out the direct effect on those traditional Medicaid populations. By 2036, Avalere said, Medicaid funding for the disabled would be 18 percent lower than it would be under current law ۥ and for poor children, it would be 31 percent lower. Avalere۪s report did not include an estimate of precisely how this would affect insurance coverage. (And with Republicans set to vote next week, the Congressional Budget Office won۪t have time to produce such an estimate beforehand either.) But Caroline Pearson , Avalere۪s senior vice president for policy and strategy, told HuffPost that there۪s no question the net impact of Graham-Cassidy would be fewer people with insurance, even in the short term before the really huge cuts hit. This bill is likely to result in lower rates of insurance as soon as 2020 when funding for insurance coverage goes down,۝ Pearson said. It will result in massive coverage losses in later years as funding for block grants expires and per capita cap growth rates drop.۝ As for Cassidy۪s other claim, that his bill would protect people with pre-existing conditions, that۪s not true, at least in the sense most people would understand it. The bill would very explicitly allow states to waive existing rules , which the Affordable Care Act put in place, prohibiting insurers from charging higher premiums to people based on their medical status. With that flexibility, insurers could make coverage prohibitively expensive for people with a variety of medical conditions, from diabetes to cancer. That۪s one reason independent experts are in broad agreement about the effect of Graham-Cassidy ۥ and in direct disagreement with Cassidy۪s own assessment. It۪s certainly possible to defend the Graham-Cassidy bill honestly ۥ by arguing, for example, that cutting federal spending is more important than improving access to health care. Cassidy has frequently said lower federal spending is a big priority for him. And later in the Morning Joe۝ interview, when Cassidy noted that coverage is already unaffordable for many Americans, even with the Affordable Care Act in place, he was absolutely right. The reality is that, by requiring insurers to sell coverage regardless of pre-existing conditions, the 2010 health care law has raised premiums. Subsidies insulate the majority of buyers from those higher prices, but still leave millions paying full price ۥ and paying much more than they did previously. But multiple studies have shown that the net effect of the Affordable Care Act has been better access to care and less financial hardship because of medical bills. Cassidy۪s repeal bill would reverse that progress, as Avalere and other analysts have pointed out ۥ helping some people, for sure, but overall making access and affordability worse."

But ask Walker, a 30-year-old mother of three, if she wishes her state۪s laws were more restrictive on those issues ۥ some of which were recently debated in the Wyoming Legislature ۥ and she۪ll tell you absolutely not. I definitely don۪t care about passing laws to prevent gays from adopting,۝ she said, bouncing her 18-month-old son, Zeke, in her arms outside a local bank in this northeastern Wyoming coal town. I don۪t want my legislature to do that. These are just my beliefs.۝ About 40 miles away in the tiny town of Wright, Lori Sanders is wiping down a counter at Hank۪s Roadside Bar and Grill, a hot spot for local miners when they get off work. She۪ll tell you people don۪t care much for politics here; it۪s more of a party scene, with late nights of J_germeister shots and customers fumbling for quarters at 2 a.m. to try to fish sex toys out of the claw machine in the back. Sanders, who has tended bar here for years, says her favorite part of the job is just seeing how accepting everyone is of each other. It may not be the most diverse area; it۪s an overwhelmingly white, working-class community. But anyone is welcome, she said, and that۪s part of what being a Wyomingite means. We don۪t put anybody to the side because of who they are,۝ said Sanders, 43. I know so many gays and I know so many different religions and stuff, that if they was to walk in here right now, I would hug every one of ۪em.۝ Judging by the numbers, Wyoming is the most conservative state in the country. Every statewide elected official is Republican, as are 78 of the 90 state legislators. President Donald Trump won all but one county last year, and the 68.2 percent of the vote he received here was the highest in the nation. More Wyoming residents self-identify as conservative۝ than in any other state, according to a Gallup poll released earlier this year, outnumbering self-identified liberals۝ by 35 percentage points. Yet, there is a confounding aspect to the way conservatism expresses itself in the Cowboy State: Some of the most hot-button social issues haven۪t caught on. In the last legislative session, a proposed bathroom bill۝ targeting transgender people never made it to the floor. Gov. Matt Mead (R) vetoed a bill that would have allowed people to carry guns into state and local government meetings, saying its effects were murky. While Wyoming lacks easy access to abortion facilities as it is ۥ the only clinics are in the town of Jackson ۥ legislation aimed at further restricting reproductive rights routinely fails,despite a couple of related measures that recently passed. Political issues are much the same. As Republican legislatures in far more moderate states scramble to pass stringent laws requiring official identification to vote in elections, Wyoming voters can register at the polls on the day of the election  no ID needed. Secretary of State Ed Murray (R) has railed against the Trump administration۪s Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, calling it a precursor to unconstitutional overreach in state elections. It appears Wyomingites have their own ideas about what it means to be conservative. HuffPost and the Casper Star-Tribune drove around eastern Wyoming talking to people in supermarkets, in bars and on the streets to find out what they make of their state۪s unusual breed of conservatism. There was a clear theme: In a state as vast as Wyoming and with so few people in it ۥ it۪s the least populated in the country, with 585,000 residents ۥ people mostly just want to live and let live. Walker, a stay-at-home mom, said she۪s way more concerned about being able to afford health care for her kids than having an ideological debate about who has to pee in which bathroom. We۪re struggling,۝ she said. We pay $1,000 a month for [post-employment health insurance]. My husband runs a small business. He doesn۪t have enough employees to provide health care.۝ Things like transgender bathroom bills don۪t affect me,۝ Walker added. We should do what۪s best for most people.۝ Carl Kruzich, a 63-year-old retired plumber in Casper, said he thinks people are too focused on political labels and that they don۪t really matter. Who am I to decide what۪s for anybody else?۝ he asked. Every time people talk about liberals and conservatives, they۪ve got to explain it to me again so I can figure out what the hell I am. I۪m serious. I could give a flying fuck,۝ Kruzich said. Just get along. Work things out. Isn۪t that what we۪re supposed to be doing?۝ Politicians in the state seem to understand this message. The Wyoming Legislature meets for less than two months each year in Cheyenne and lawmakers generally hold full-time jobs outside of politics. With a packed agenda when lawmakers do get together, there often simply isn۪t time to spend on divisive topics, said Republican political consultant Bill Cubin. Rank-and-file legislators, they۪ll tell you, We have so little time down in Cheyenne in the legislative session. We have to get budgets done and fund infrastructure and set policy that is impacting people today,۪۝ Cubin said. A lot of those social issues fall through the cracks.۝ There are other dimensions to the state۪s unconventional politics . In a sit-down interview, the governor said that despite Republican dominance, there is a significant diversity of opinion within their ranks. He speculated that because it is such a red state, there are some politicians who might be Democrats in other states but slap an R۝ after their name here. I have close friends who I think, many will even say, I am more closely aligned with the Democratic Party, but I want relevance in terms of how I participate in the political process,۪۝ Mead said. I do think that happens.۝ He also thinks politics is inherently different in a state with so few people. When we talk about policy, it۪s not on academic terms. It affects your cousin and my sister. It affects our neighbor,۝ Mead said. I think that۪s why trust is not limited to just a D۪ or an R.۪ It۪s, We want you to delve into this because what you do in a citizen legislature with a small population, you will effect change.۪۝ Perhaps that is how state Treasurer Mark Gordon, a former member of the Sierra Club and donor to Democrat John Kerry۪s presidential run in 2004, can be considered a front-runner in the Republican primary to replace Mead next year. It۪s not to say Wyoming doesn۪t embrace traditionally conservative policies in certain areas. It has some of the lowest property and sales taxes in the country, and no personal or corporate income tax. Even while facing a budget deficit of several hundred million dollars, leaders in the Legislature have shown far more interest in slashing services than raising revenue. When it comes to natural resources, the lifeblood of the state۪s economy, nearly all politicians call for more state control and less federal influence on drilling and mining regulations. And political observers see some social issues advancing in the Legislature, too. They point to two bills regulating abortion that passed last year ۥ the first ones on this issue to become law in nearly 30 years ۥ as well as a larger trend toward GOP litmus tests in the form of candidate questionnaires and anti-tax pledges. Are you a Republican in name only?۝ is how Marguerite Herman, a longtime lobbyist for the League of Women Voters in Wyoming, describes this new attitude in GOP political circles. I mean, that phrase never used to come up. It comes up all the time now.۝ Some residents wouldn۪t mind if party leaders tackled social issues a bit more. Kathy Gaffney of Gillette said she۪s struggling with how liberal her daughters have become since they went off to college and moved to Colorado. They believe in everything: gay rights, abortion, you know, just anti-religious type things,۝ said Gaffney, 68, a recent retiree. I do not want any of those things going on.۝ Denise Lubken, her friend standing nearby, just laughed. She put her arm around Gaffney and said she used to get upset about those issues. But after moving to Wyoming several years back with her husband, she said, she۪s moved past the days of looking for causes and jumping up and down and screaming them.۝ Life is slow here, said Lubken, a 60-year-old former school counselor. Communities are small and spread apart. People are more interested in trying to connect with each other ۥ and accept each other for who they are ۥ than in trying to conform to whatever the Republican Party considers to be a true conservative,۝ she said. I۪d rather have a relationship with people,۝ Lubken added. What۪s the alternative, I can۪t care anything about you because you believe in something different?۪ Just a bunch of fighting and screaming? We just don۪t do that.۝"

As we reported Tuesday , a short, bald man who looked exactly like the publisher of The Daily Stormer, one of the biggest neo-Nazi websites in the world, was spotted buying protein powder in a grocery store outside Columbus, Ohio, two weeks ago. This was bad news for Anglin, who is currently embroiled in a federal court case in Montana in which his whereabouts matter a great deal. Anglin is arguing that he exists beyond the reach of federal litigation as a stateless۝ person, an unusual legal category that applies to American citizens who live abroad with the intent to remain there indefinitely. In July, Anglin managed to troll CNN into publishing that he lives in Lagos, Nigeria .Amazingly,that۪s what he and his lawyers were going with in court. But now there۪d been a sighting of the neo-Nazi in the Columbus area. And the spotter was a process server  one of the very people hired to find Anglin and deliver him notice of the lawsuit. The man, whom I۪d been in contact with before the sighting, told me about the encounter and his frustration at not having the necessary legal paperwork with him. He requested at the time that HuffPost withhold his name so he could preserve an element of surprise should he need to approach Anglin again. Enraged, Anglin took to his website. It is a confirmed fact that I live in Nigeria,۝ the propagandist wrote, but the fake news media are too big of cowards to visit a country filled up with blacks.۝ Then Anglin took to GAB, a social media platform favored by far-right extremists, to falsely accuse me of fabricating sources. He referred to another story I۪d written about him in The Atlantic magazine in which I described a woman۪s encounter with Anglin in another store in Columbus in February. The woman hadn۪t been an anonymous source. Anglin just failed to grasp how magazine journalism works, especially after fact-checkers and lawyers check copy. The Daily Stormer puts an online horde of racists and fascists at Anglin۪s disposal. He uses these gullible minions,  his Stormer Troll Army۝ʉ to do his dirty work. At Anglin۪s behest, they harassed me for two days this week, calling my phone all through the night. They sent menacing voicemails and emails, and tried to feed me false information about the location of their master. The fact-based world, however, has a tendency to intrude. On late Thursday night, the attorneys for Tanya Gersh, the plaintiff in the Montana lawsuit, who is suing Anglin for orchestrating a brutal campaign of harassment against her and her family, filed a document in court that dismantles at least one of his lies. It is a declaration from the process server who spotted Anglin in the grocery store outside Columbus. This is the source that Anglin accused me of fabricating. His name is Jeffrey Cremeans. Here is his statement: While the case promises to be a significant one in the internet era because of the First Amendment issues it raises, the question of jurisdiction  and Anglin۪s whereabouts  must be addressed first. By every indication,he was a resident and a citizen of Ohio at the time Gersh filed her lawsuit in April, which would give a federal court jurisdiction over him. He never officially changed his citizenship or domicile. He was registered to vote in Ohio. His neo-Nazi business was registered in Ohio. He admitted to being in Columbus for a court hearing in February. That month, he also admitted in the comments section of his site that he was picking up checks his readers mailed to his father۪s Christian counseling office in Columbus: Anglin has been fleeing litigation for the better part of a year. But his time is almost up. Defendant can only hide for so long,۝ Gersh۪s lawyers wrote in the latest filing to the court.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-dealmaking-skills-mexico-australia_us_598b7e7fe4b0d793738c729a","WASHINGTON ۥ Donald Trump is the best at making deals. The best! He۪ll tell you himself by tweeting unsolicited advice on how to win in a negotiation or bragging about his book The Art of the Deal (which he didn۪t actually write , but whatever). Now we can see for ourselves how the president puts his deal-making skills to work. Last week, The Washington Post released transcripts of two phone calls Trump had with foreign leaders in January  one with Mexican President Enrique Pe̱a Nieto and another with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. It۪s a rare window into how Trump works his magic with people one-on-one when he doesn۪t think anyone is watching. There were no deals made on either call. Trump threatened Pe̱a Nieto, a top U.S. ally, with tariffs on Mexican goods and then warned he۪d never meet with him unless he stopped saying publicly that Mexico won۪t pay for Trump۪s promised border wall. In a heated exchange with Turnbull, also a key U.S. ally, Trump vented about the stupid deal۝ the United States had made with Australia to accept refugees into the country. He all but hung up on Turnbull in the end. Is this as bananas as it sounds? Or maybe Trump is deploying clever, art-of-the-deal tactics that casual observers might miss? We asked experts in business and diplomatic negotiation to weigh in. His skills are few,۝ John Oesch, an associate professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, said in an email. He has relied on power (or perceived power), threats, and treating people very poorly to get what he wants. Most negotiation scholars agree that power is an unsustainable way to resolve conflict and a poor negotiating technique, unless you want only to take from the other party and not create any value for either side.۝ Anthony Wanis-St. John, an associate professor at the School of International Service at American University, said Trump۪s approach was very transactional,۝ a style that may have served him well in commercial real estate but will flop in international relations. He۪s treating Pe̱a Nieto as if he were a merchant and he were a souvenir purchaser haggling for a price,۝ said Wanis-St. John. This is ill-suited for complex policy decisions that require much more persuasion and problem solving. It makes Trump look a little venal, a little weak. Not like the president of a great power.۝ But some saw a deeper level of negotiation taking place, even in a constructive way. Daniel Shapiro, an associate professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and director of the Harvard International Negotiation Program, said if you look past each leader۪s stated position and consider his underlying interests, there۪s a lot of overlap. With the border wall, for example, Trump and Pe̱a Nieto disagreed on everything about it, but both worried about losing credibility if they budged in their positions. As for accepting refugees from Australia, Trump worried about looking foolish for taking them in after imposing his travel ban, and Turnbull didn۪t want to be strong-armed into breaking a U.S.-Australia agreement. The common denominator, says Shapiro, is saving face. Nobody wants to feel taken. Effective negotiators recognize that once we understand each other۪s underlying interests, we can truly invent options for mutual gain,۝ said Shapiro, who wrote the book Negotiating the Nonnegotiable: How to Resolve Your Most Emotionally Charged Conflicts . These leaders behind closed doors need to feel comfortable sharing information with one another so they can start figuring out options that address each of their constituency۪s interests.۝ There۪s no question, though, that Trump۪s default is bullying people to get his way. One of the first stories he tells in The Art of the Deal is about a call he made to a bank executive to try to help an older woman, Mrs. Hill, whose farm was facing foreclosure. Her husband had killed himself in the hopes his life insurance would save the farm, but it turned out it wasn۪t enough. The bank executive told Trump the bank was moving ahead with auctioning off the farm, and there was nothing he could do about it. That really got me going,۝ Trump writes. I said to the guy, You listen to me. If you do foreclose, I۪ll personally bring a lawsuit for murder against you and your bank, on the grounds that you harassed Mrs. Hill۪s husband to death.۪ All of a sudden the bank officer sounded very nervous and said he۪d get right back to me. Sometimes it pays to be a little wild.۝ His belligerent approach to negotiating is an example of what experts call distributive bargaining  making outrageous demands and hoping the other side gives ground in a zero-sum situation, says Fen Osler Hampson, a distinguished fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation in Canada. The problem with applying this tactic to something like, say, threatening tariffs on Mexican imports is that it would damage the U.S. economy, too, by driving up prices of products. As we۪ve heard from American companies who do business across the border, it۪s going to hurt U.S. jobs. You don۪t negotiate by shooting yourself in your own foot,۝ said Hampson. It۪s a pretty weak weapon. Choose your weapons carefully.۝ For those with firsthand experience in international diplomacy, a stunning detail from the president۪s calls was that his team didn۪t appear to bring him up to speed on the issues relevant to the world leaders he was talking to. For example, Trump told Pe̱a Nieto that he could help him fight organized crime by sending the U.S. military into Mexico. Anyone who knows anything about the U.S.-Mexico relationship knows that the idea of U.S. troops on Mexican soil is a no-no,۝ said Arturo Sarukhn, who served as the Mexican ambassador to the U.S. from 2007 to 2013. So no one briefed the president and said, This is the type of stuff you can say, this is no-go territory?۪ That۪s troubling.۝ Asked how he would respond to Trump۪s push for a border wall if he were still the Mexican ambassador, Sarukhn said he would never challenge how the United States wants to handle its security matters. But he would make it clear to the Trump administration that a wall would tank relations with Mexico. All the issues in Trump۪s campaign ۥ the qualifications of Mexicans as rapists and bad hombres۪ and the wall ۥ have poisoned the well of public perception of the U.S. in Mexico,۝ he said. This is where I think Trump has had a more detrimental effect on the U.S.-Mexico relationship. He has turned the clock back on how citizens on both sides need to understand they are co-stakeholders.۝ Besides, have walls ever really been effective? Even the former Mexican ambassador knows the White Walkers will eventually clear that 700-foot wall of icy magic in Game of Thrones۝ and try to wipe out the human race. Oh, they۪re going to get past it. We can see that coming,۝ Sarukhn predicted. I۪d love to see Daenerys and Jon Snow slugging it out with dragons and dragon glass.۝"

No WH chaos! ۝ he posted to Twitter Monday morning.  A great day at the White House! ۝ he wrote in the evening. Actually, it was another day consumed with turmoil, dysfunction and, of course, revelations  as has become the norm since Trump moved into the White House. The Washington Post reported late Monday that Trump intervened in his team۪s planned response to the revelation that Donald Trump Jr. had met in 2016 with a lawyer linked to the Russian government , dictating that his son claim the meeting primarily focused on a Russian adoption program. Trump۪s eldest son later acknowledged that he took the meeting after being promised damaging information on Trump۪s presidential opponent, Hillary Clinton . Advisers told the Post they worry that by directing his son۪s response, Trump may have put himself at legal risk. This was ... unnecessary,۝ one of Trump۪s advisers reportedly told the Post. Now someone can claim he۪s the one who attempted to mislead. Somebody can argue the president is saying he doesn۪t want you to say the whole truth.۝ Initially, Trump۪s team had planned to give a truthful account of the June 2016 meeting between Trump Jr. and Kremlin-linked lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Post reported. But while en route back to the U.S. from the Group of 20 summit in Germany on July 8, Trump  fresh off a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin  stepped in. The statement Trump Jr. put out that day read: It was a short introductory meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up. I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand.۝ The next day, after The New York Times revealed the meeting was to discuss dirt on Clinton , Trump Jr. changed his explanation, saying he took the meeting because he was made to believe that the individual might have information helpful to the campaign.۝ The Washington Post۪s latest scoop adds to what was already another astonishing day for the Trump administration  one that saw White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci forced out of his position after just 10 days on the job . And Monday comes on the heels of what was arguably the White House۪s most head-spinning week to date. Along with Trump attacking his own attorney general, endorsing police brutality and giving a bizarre, highly politicized speech to tens of thousands of Boy Scouts, last week included the fall of former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus , Scaramucci۪s vulgar tirade to The New Yorker, and Republican senators defeating a skinny۝ repeal of the Affordable Care Act. It۪s early, but the White House۪s American Dream۝ week ۥ the third in a series of Trump administration theme weeks to promote U.S. products and people ۥ is off to a rocky start.

On Monday, Trump finally issued a stronger statement, one that denounced  the KKK, Neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups .۝However, he did not tweet a reproach of these extremists ۥ an odd move for a president who tweets every thought that comes into his head. Critics saw the retweet on Monday evening as an attempt to deflect attention from his belated response to white supremacist violence, but also as an implicit effort to draw attention to crime within the African-American community: Many of the critics described Posobiec as alt-right.۝He denies the label, calling himself part of the New Right۝ and saying he has  denounced hate groups and bigotry .۝ The Anti-Defamation League considers Posobiec to be part of the Alt Lite,۝ which it calls a loosely-connected movement whose adherents generally shun white supremacist thinking, but who are in step with the alt-right in their hatred of feminists and immigrants, among others.۝ The group said of Posobiec:  He has enthusiastically promoted a range of lies, including the Pizzagate hoax and attempted to discredit anti-Trump activists by planting an inflammatory Rape Melania۪ sign at a protest event.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-administration-cdc-banned-words_us_5a348ed2e4b0ff955ad3221d","In an astonishing order, the Trump administration has banned the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from using seven words  including fetus,۝ʉtransgender,۝ diversity۝ and science-based۝ in any documents used to prepare the agency۪s budget, The Washington Post has reported. CDC policy analysts were reportedly informed of the forbidden words in a 90-minute meeting in Atlanta on Thursday with senior CDC officials. The other banned words are vulnerable,۝ entitlement۝ and evidence-based,۝ according to the Post, citing an unnamed policy analyst. The meeting was led by a senior member of the CDC۪s Office of Financial Services. She didn۪t know why the words were forbidden and said she was merely relaying information, the Post reported. Instead of the words science-based۝ or evidence-based,۝ analysts were told they could use instead: The CDC bases its recommendations on science in consideration with community standards and wishes,۝ the newspaper reported. The Post۪s source could not recall a previous time in any other administration when words were forbidden. Dr. Loren Schechter, director of the Center for Gender Confirmation surgery at Weiss Memorial Hospital in Chicago and a member of the board of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health , said he was shocked by the edict. I۪m not sure what the ultimate rationale is for doing this aside from trying to erase certain types of people off the map,۝he told HuffPost, referring to the ban on the words transgender۝ and diversity.۝ I think walking back hard-earned civil rights is something that is, number one, quite shocking to me and, number two, quite concerning. Simply choosing to ignore reality, science, medicine, will not make these things go away and will not really advance anyone۪s cause or lead to improved health outcomes.۝ This is quite an absurdity,۝ Schechter said. The president sets the agenda. It۪s quite scary ... it really sends a chill down your spine. I can۪t imagine how you don۪t allow terms to be used. It۪s sort of like the thought police here. Perhaps we can say the world is flat now,۝ he said. Twitter erupted following the news. Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) complained that Trump is making America stupid again۝ and wondered if leaders would soon be supporting voodoo and leeches to fight disease.

In a response to the Washington Post۪s report, CDC Director Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald tweeted Sunday that there were  no banned words at CDC .۝ She also quoted the Health and Human Services۪ statement about the story, which called the article a complete mischaracterization۝ of the budget discussion. But treating science as a matter of opinion rather than an objective, evidence-based reality appears to have become a hallmark of the Trump administration, particularly when it comes to climate change. So, too, is scrubbing certain words and information from discussions, documents and websites that don۪t fit with Donald Trump ۪s vision. The Department of Health and Human Services has dropped information on its website about LGBTQ individuals. Banning valid terminology from government reports is both ignorant and dangerous,۝ Arthur Caplan, professor of bioethics at New York University۪s School of Medicine, told HuffPost in an email. Not since Lysenko and Stalin has government made hate, malice and duplicity official policy. The Trump administration with its seven-dirty-words policy has now elevated lying to a national standard.

Following Heller۪s announcement in June that he would oppose the first version of the Senate۪s health care bill , a pro-Trump political action group ran ads against him .

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/protesting-dc-trump-inauguration-trial_us_5a1e1e84e4b0d724fed48d32","WASHINGTON ۥ Justice Department prosecutor Jennifer Kerkhoff carried the cardboard evidence box past the jury and placed it next to Officer Andre Reid, the 14-year veteran of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department seated in the witness stand. Snapping on blue medical gloves inside this downtown courtroom, she took out a JanSport backpack ۥ the government۪s exhibit number 43 ۥ and began removing its contents: two sharpies, a pencil, a pen, a Florida driver۪s license, green goggles, a black bandana, black gloves, sunglasses, an energy drink,a phone charger with a cord, and a black hat. As jurors looked on,Kerkhoff and Reid examined a mask. Have you ever heard of the term balaclava۪?۝ Kerkhoff asked? Reid hadn۪t. He called it a ski mask.They took a look at a plastic bag containing two bandanas soaked in some mysterious solution۝ that had a smell to it. Can you smell that now?۝ Kerkhoff asked. Reid could. The JanSport in question belongs to Michelle Macchio, a 26-year-old from Naples who hasn۪t had possession of the bag or its contents in nearly 11 months, ever since she was caught up in a mass arrest during a protest just before President Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. Macchio said she was acting as a medic that day. Video shows her with red tape in the shape of a cross on her jacket, and her lawyers say she was carrying a first aid kit. That mysterious foul-smelling solution? Vinegar, which is supposed to dilute the impact of the pepper spray that videos demonstrate police officers shot with abandon that morning. In the past three weeks, as special counsel Robert Mueller۪s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election has increasingly jeopardized the Trump presidency۪s future, Macchio and her co-defendants are facing down their own.Macchio is one of six individuals currently on trial in the nation۪s capital, facing felony charges that could potentially land them in federal prison for decades, or at the very least leave them with felony convictions that would stunt their career prospects and deprive them of certain rights. Another 181 individuals are facing felony trials in the coming year, though the ultimate resolution of a large number of those cases could depend on how this first trial plays out. Twenty other defendants arrested that day have already pleaded guilty, but just one defendant pleaded guilty to a felony. Seven others facing misdemeanors are scheduled for a trial by judge. The charges all stem from a mass arrest conducted by police in downtown D.C. aimed at a group of marchers that included anti-capitalists, anti-fascists and anarchists under the umbrella of an organization called DisruptJ20. Police had kept an eye on what demonstrators had planned that day, sending an undercover officer into a planning meeting where an organizer said their goal was to  make inauguration a giant clusterfuck .۝ Things quickly got out of control once the group left their gathering point in Logan Circle ,with individuals from within the group of mostly black-clad demonstrators breaking store windows,throwing newspaper boxes, spray-painting cars, smashing parking meters and hurling rocks at officers. How precisely to define the group has been an issue in court, where prosecutors and defense attorneys have sparred outside of the presence of the jury over the use and definition of the term antifa.۝Ultimately,Superior Court Judge Lynn Leibovitz told jurors that antifa is short for anti-fascist or anti-fascism۝ and that the term was not as an indication that individuals themselves intended violence.۝ Under threat from the judge, prosecutors and witnesses have also had to avoid the use of the termʉ black bloc ,۝ a reference to a protest tactic intended to anonymize individuals within the group. But in her opening statement in the trial on Nov. 20, Kerkhoff repeatedly referred to a  sea of black masks ۝ that caused destruction that day. The possession or wearing of black clothing has become a central aspect of the prosecution۪s case. During one day of the trial, she held up a skull cap featuring an image of a skull that was seized from defendant Christina Simmons, a 20-year-old from Maryland who offered snacks from her backpack to officers who processed her, according to her defense attorney. Jurors have heard from numerous business owners and employees who had their property damaged by members of the group that day. They۪ve also heard from numerous police officers about the chaos they encountered, including an officer injured as he tried to apprehend an individual who threw a patio chair at his colleague. What jurors haven۪t heard, and prosecutors don۪t intend to offer, is evidence that any of the six individuals currently on trialʉۥ Macchio, Simmons, Jennifer Armento, Oliver Harris, Brittne Lawson and Alexei Wood ۥ actually engaged in any property damage or violence.Under the government۪s theory of the case, in which anyone arrested in the group is part of a conspiracy and is responsible for any actions taken by others,the lack of individualized wrongdoing doesn۪t matter. Prosecutors have charged all six with eight charges, including six felonies. If convicted,they۪d be exposed to a potential maximum sentence of more than 60 years in federal prison (though such an extreme sentence is extraordinarily unlikely). Each of them made a choice, and each of them played a role,۝Kerkhoff told jurors in her opening statement. You don۪t personally have to be the one who breaks the window to be guilty of rioting.۝ Kerkhoff, who is leading the prosecution, works for the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, one of 94 U.S. attorney۪s offices within the Justice Department. The U.S. attorney۪s office in the nation۪s capital is unique in that it prosecutes both federal crimes and local crimes that would normally be handled by a local prosecutor,who are typically elected. The office in D.C. is currently headed by a Trump appointee named Jessie Liu,though the cases unfolded until September under former acting U.S. Attorney Channing Phillips,a holdover from the Obama administration who is close with former Attorney General Eric Holder. At the moment, there۪s no way to ascribe the handling of these prosecutions to Trump political appointees with any degree of certainty. But it۪s certainly worth considering that Trump, who branded himself as the law-and-order candidate, had vowed to end۝ the anti-police atmosphere۝ in America and has made his feelings about protesters on the left well known. The White House website, updated on the day of the inauguration,says the Trump administration would not make life more comfortable for the rioter, the looter, or the violent disrupter.۝ More recently, after the deadly August attack in Charlottesville, Virginia , during a white supremacist rally,the president has talked about the  advent of antifa ۝ and compared the loosely-organized anti-fascist movement to actual neo-Nazis. The Trump administration۪s charging policy could have also had an impact on the handling of the cases.Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has spoken out about his belief that free speech is under attack on college campuses, ordered federal prosecutors in May to charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense۝ possible. Kerkhoff and her colleague, Assistant U.S. Attorney Rizwan Qureshi,have presented jurors with a plethora of evidence from Jan. 20: surveillance videos, aerial footage, body cam video, data from all of the cellphones they seized, and even a livestream of the entire march that was shot by Wood, photographer among the defendants . Over and over again, jurors have seen individuals clad in black destroying property during the march. In lengthy and at times tedious presentations, they۪ve used videos, screenshots, maps and PowerPoint presentations to prove that the defendants were, in fact, present at the march.The not-so-implicit message to the jury: Someone needed to be held accountable for the damage inflicted that day. The backdrop of the aggressive charges against so many demonstrators is that law enforcement officials in D.C.,home to frequent protests due to its status as the nation۪s capital, have taken a relatively progressive approach to policing demonstrations in recent years following lawsuits over their past conduct. Ahead of the inauguration, demonstration organizers discussed their perceptions of the restrictions on police, with one podcast played for jurors referring to D.C. police as trained little piggies۝ who had been sued into a state of fear.۝ The District of Columbia does have rules that officers are supposed to follow when policing a First Amendment demonstration, and defense attorneys have zeroed in on the inconsistencies between what police are supposed to do and what they actually did. Did they issue a warning to disperse, as required? We didn۪t give any dispersal orders,۝ testified Commander Keith Deville. We weren۪t required to tell them, stop rioting.۪۝ Deville, who oversaw the law enforcement response to downtown demonstrations on Jan. 20, testified that he believed Metropolitan Police Department officers showed enormous restraint۝ in their handling of the demonstrations. But defense attorneys played a number of clips that appeared to show officers casually deploying pepper spray, even on individuals who had their backs turned to the officers and were walking away. They also played clips that showed officers roughly handling individuals who weren۪t engaged in any wrongdoing, including video that showed a legal observer getting blindsided with a shove from behind. In one instance, Deville testified he couldn۪t say why an officer shoved a woman with a baton from behind, but said the technique was proper. There were two hands on it,۝ he said. They weren۪t bludgeoning somebody.۝ In another instance, he said he was not sure what that deployment was for۝ when confronted with a video of an officer casually spraying people. I don۪t know what their intention was,۝ Deville said about another clip that appeared to show improper use of pepper spray. Among D.C. elected officials, questions about how police handled the demonstrations has been a matter of controversy. The D.C. City Council has budgeted $150,000 to investigate how police dealt with the unrest that day. There۪s also an outstanding ACLU lawsuit, and Deville admitted that he believes criminal convictions in this case would perhaps limit our civil liability in the matter.۝ In a separate tense exchange, a defense attorney questioned Deville about past allegations that he had displayed bias toward some minority groups. Deville admitted repeating a conversation he once had with another officer about the Holocaust Museum road being named after Raoul Wallenberg, who has been credited with saving the lives of tens of thousands of Jews during the Nazi occupation of Hungary. The other officer had referred to Wallenberg as the one that got away,۝a comment Deville apparently repeated over the years. He called it a very morose comment.۝But Deville testified that he was not biased against Jewish people. Deville also denied that he was biased against gay people despite allegedly once warning his colleagues to watch what they said when a gay officer joined their unit.And Deville further said that he was not biased against transgender people, despite once complaining that he had to call a transgender women he۪d worked with for four years Jessica۝ instead of Bill.۝ At the time, Deville said, he was still trying get my head around the change,۝ but he was not complaining that he had to call her Jessica. He was disciplined by the department for the comment. The prosecution is expected to wrap up their case on Monday, and the defense will likely take over the rest of the week. The jury may begin deliberations sometime next week. Even if none of these six defendants are convicted, the legal process on its own will still have proven to be a significant form of punishment, with the defendants from various parts of the country essentially moving to D.C. for the duration of the trial. While the defendants have, for the most part, been reluctant to speak with the handful of reporters who have sporadically covered the trial over the past few weeks, Elizabeth Lagesse was willing to chat. Sitting in a courtroom taking careful, copious notes, it۪d be easy to mistake her for a reporter. But Lagesse is actually a co-defendant, facing her own trial in July with a separate group of individuals on several felony charges in connection with her own Inauguration Day arrest. Lagesse, a former John Hopkins University graduate student who had been planning to move to California and pursue work in the tech sector, said her life has essentially been put on hold as she fights off felony charges that could jeopardize her future. She and her fianc̩, who was also arrested that day, have moved to D.C. to defray the cost of traveling back and forth from Baltimore for hearings. They۪ve been living on his salary alone,not necessarily an easy feat in the city, and are now committed to a year lease. Prosecutors still have the cell phone they seized from her that day, We finally saved up and ordered a new phone,۝ Lagesse said. But he۪s been using like a broken, not that great phone. I got one awhile back that, you know, works. It has been a really big burden. We۪ve had to coordinate, like, whose phone works today?۝ She says prosecutors were not able to get anything off of either of their phones because they were encrypted iPhones. Lagesse, who wrote an op-ed for The New York Times about her experience and is part of an ACLU lawsuit against D.C. police over their conduct that day, says Jan. 20 was the first time she۪d ever been arrested. This is also the first time she۪s spent significant time inside a courtroom. She called the process incredibly frustrating۝ and scary. One person makes a decision, and it can disrupt 200 people۪s lives for more than a year. It just seems nuts,۝ Lagesse said. But it۪s also been kind of fascinating for her. Lawyers have told me that they never get to hear the whole case before they start a trial, so it۪s kind of an amazing opportunity. You get to watch a do-over trial,۝ Lagesse said. It just proves I can nerd out about anything.۝ Lagesse, who grew up in a conservative family living in northern California, said her family of Trump supporters had a tough time accepting that she was actually facing several felony charges. It۪s hard for a lot of people to believe that this is actually happening, because it is insane. I get that a lot,۝ Lagesse said. This is happening. It۪s every bit as crazy as it looks. No, it۪s not just going to go away.۝ The partner of defendant Brittne Lawson, a 27-year-old nurse from Pittsburgh, told HuffPost that she had to quit her job because there was no way to adjust her schedule to accommodate a trial that will likely stretch on for more than a month. The trial is for sure longer than all of Brit۪s potential vacation time for the whole year,۝ Lawson۪s partner, who requested to be identified only by his first name of Jeff, said. This is a full-time job.۝ Lawson has been able to get housing in Washington during the trial though the Dead City Legal Posse, an organization formed to support the defendants shortly after their mass arrest. Frankly, when you۪re going through something really stressful like this, you want a quiet space that is your own, that feels safe,۝ Jeff said. And instead you۪re like sleeping on somebody۪s couch.۝ Jeff said he believes that people from across the political spectrum should be able to recognize the threat of the aggressive prosecution, but said that even some members of their extended families had bought into the idea of cracking down on protests. You see the divisions within the U.S., where there۪s some people in our extended family who are like, Oh, you should be in jail forever for someone else in a protest you were at breaking windows,۪۝ Jeff said. Defense attorneys will be calling several witnesses this week, and several of the defendants may take the stand in their own defense. Wood, the photographer on trial , will likely explain to the jury why he had a press pass in another individual۪s name. The six defendants۪ attorneys, who outnumber the actual jury, will likely also raise First Amendment concerns and say that police made no effort to differentiate between those who were exercising their rights and those who were causing destruction. Steven McCool, who is representing defendant Harris, told the judge outside of the presence of the jury last week that he۪d be requesting a jury instruction on the First Amendment. What kind of jury instruction, Judge Lynn Leibovitz wondered, one that said we like it a lot?۝ I wish we liked it more,۝replied McCool, a former federal prosecutor. Apparently we don۪t.۝ Ryan Reilly is HuffPost۪s senior justice reporter, covering criminal justice, federal law enforcement and legal affairs. Have a tip?

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/equifax-breach-2017_us_59b2dae8e4b0b5e531062976","UPDATE: Sept. 11 ۥ In a reversal, Equifax said in a statement Monday morning that the company wouldn۪t require credit card information from victims of the company۪s data breach who sign up for its free service. We are not requesting consumers۪ credit card information when they sign up for the free credit file monitoring and identity theft protection we are offering to all U.S. consumers,۝ the company said in a statement on its website. Consumers who sign up for TrustedID Premier will not be automatically enrolled or charged after the conclusion of the complimentary year of TrustedID Premier.۝ Equifax had quietly removed information about charges and fees from its terms of use۝ over the weekend. PREVIOUSLY: WASHINGTON ۥ The credit monitoring company that let criminals steal personal information pertaining to nearly half the U.S. population is offering free credit monitoring to those affected ۥ but there۪s a catch. Victims of the Equifax security breach who sign up for the company۪s complimentary۝ service will only get one free year. After that, unless they proactively cancel, they may have to pay. The terms of use say customers must have internet access and a credit or debit card to sign up. We will not bill You until the free trial period has expired and provided that You have not yet cancelled your trial membership,۝ say the terms, dated Sept. 6. In the event that You wish to continue Your membership beyond the trial period, do nothing and Your membership will automatically continue without interruption and We will begin billing You via the payment source You provided when you signed up for the free trial.۝ Robert Weissman, president of the consumer watchdog Public Citizen, said, It appears that the company thinks one of the worst data breaches in history is a marketing opportunity. Instead of trying to rip people off with new hidden charges and trick consumers to give up their rights it might be a better idea to actually remedy the harm.۝ A spokesperson for Equifax did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the free service. Customers also must agree to settle disputes outside of court in an extremely business-friendly format known as arbitration. Consumer advocates describe the arbitration clause as a straightforward ripoff for the 143 million Americans whose Social Security numbers and addresses are now in the hands of criminals thanks to a breach earlier this year. Though it discovered the breach in late July, Equifax publicly announced the news on Thursday. At this point it۪s very clear that Equifax is trying to use this massive data breach as an excuse to profit, which is just appalling behavior,۝ said Amanda Werner, the campaign manager at Americans for Financial Reform. I can۪t even put into words how awful this behavior is.۝ As Equifax explains in the terms of use, customers using its products are subject to mandatory, binding arbitration. By consenting to submit Your Claims to arbitration, You will be forfeiting Your right to bring or participate in any class action (whether as a named plaintiff or a class member) or to share in any class action awards, including class claims where a class has not yet been certified, even if the facts and circumstances upon which the Claims are based already occurred or existed.۝ Weissman said that the arbitration clause attached to the free credit monitoring service covers only the credit monitoring service offered and not the overarching breach of data. Still, if Equifax failed to inform a customer ۥ a victim of the hack, say ۥ that their identity had been compromised and was being used without their knowledge, by signing up for their free credit monitoring offer and thus agreeing to the arbitration clause, they would have waived the right to sue over this failure outside of arbitration. However, Equifax also requires consumers who have requested their credit score directly from the company in the past to have agreed to an arbitration clause that could cover the breach. If you۪ve been an Equifax customer, they will claim that you have agreed to an arbitration provision,۝ Weissman said. A company spokesman said the arbitration only applied to the free credit monitoring, not the cybersecurity breach. Equifax, along with Experian and TransUnion, are the three largest companies that track credit histories of everybody who takes out a loan or signs up a credit card, creating proprietary scores۝ that help lenders evaluate a potential borrower۪s ability to pay. The companies are notorious for charging access for the information, which by law is available to consumers for free once a year. Experian has been fined multiple times by the Federal Trade Commission for tricking consumers with false promises of free۝ credit reports that wound up costing money. Companies often require consumers to use their products or services if they waive their right to pursue class action lawsuits and enter into direct arbitration with the business if they seek a legal redress to a wrong. In the case of Equifax, everyone who signs up for the free credit monitoring the company is offering to the 143 million people whose data has been compromised is waiving their right to join in a class action suit if something goes wrong with the credit monitoring. The insertion of arbitration clauses into dense terms of service contracts that consumers rarely read has exploded in the past six years. In 2011, the Supreme Court upheld a forced arbitration provision inserted into AT&T contracts in a divided 5-4 ruling. This was one of many tightly divided decisions in recent years where the conservative majority on the court ruled in favor of corporate rights to force consumers into arbitration . In the face of the corporate tilt of the Supreme Court, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the financial watchdog agency created by the 2010 Wall Street reform legislation, recently announced a new rule against mandatory arbitration clauses disallowing class action lawsuits. But Republicans in Congress have vowed to strike the rule. The new CFPB arbitration rule is scheduled to take effect on Sept.18. House Republicans, however, already passed a resolution in July that would block the implementation of the rule. Republicans in the Senate have introduced similar legislation, but have not yet voted on it. That legislation is not subject to a filibuster and would therefore only require 50 votes to pass in a chamber with 52 Republican senators. Additionally, congressional Republicans are pushing legislation introduced by Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) that sides with the credit reporting companies. Loudermilk۪s bill would place a $500,000 cap on punitive damages for consumers who have been wronged. In an ironic twist, the House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on Loudermilk۪s bill on Thursday ۥ the same day Equifax revealed the breach of consumer data."

Bush did not mince words when asked about President Donald Trump, back before Trump had won the election. I don۪t like him,۝ Bush told historian Mark Updegrove in May 2016, according to The New York Times. I don۪t know much about him, but I know he۪s a blowhard. And I۪m not too excited about him being a leader.۝ Bush added that Trump appeared to be driven by a certain ego.۝ Updegrove۪s book, The Last Republicans,۝ deals with the relationship between the senior Bush and his son, former President George W. Bush. The title was inspired by a quote from the younger Bush, who told him during the 2016 election, I۪m worried that I will be the last Republican president.۝ And it wasn۪t just about Hillary Clinton becoming president, as the Republican Party was having a difficult time finding itself,۝ Updegrove told CNN. It was because Donald Trump represented everything that the Bushes abhorred.۝ The elder Bush also said that he voted for Clinton in 2016, while his son said he voted for none of the above۝ as president and Republican candidates on the rest of the ballot. Their newly revealed criticisms of Trump come just weeks after George W. Bush appeared to criticize the president at a New York policy seminar , though he didn۪t mention Trump by name. We have seen our discourse degraded by casual cruelty,۝ Bush said. We۪ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism, forgotten the dynamism that immigration has always brought to America.۝ The White House responded to news of the criticisms Saturday morning, saying in a statement, If one Presidential candidate can disassemble a political party, it speaks volumes about how strong a legacy its past two presidents really had.۝ Though liberals have historically been sharp critics of the younger Bush  for reasons including the decision to invade Iraq, a slow and widely panned response to Hurricane Katrina, and his administration۪s wholesale embrace of torture  his star has risen in the Trump era. In the wake of Trump۪s frequent inflammatory comments and constant ad hominem attacks on Twitter, many people seem to long for a president who maintained a relatively more dignified demeanor. An October survey showed that 51 percent of Democrats hold at least a somewhat favorable view of Bush. On Friday, former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann  who has previously called Bush a fascist and a liar  said he owed Bush an apology and would prefer a third Bush term to Trump as president. Last year, the public went wild with glee over a photo showing Bush and Michelle Obama enjoying a brief embrace. All the newfound nostalgia seems to ignore just how terrible many people ۥ especially Democrats ۥ thought Bush۪s presidency was at the time. For many, his lasting legacies are a disastrous Iraq war and the spread of chaos in the Middle East,as well as the financial crisis beginning during his second term. Some have argued those very conditions helped fuel the rise of the far right in the United States and abroad, paving the way for Trump to get elected."

The conservative web site The Federalist reported on Friday that Gorka resigned with a scathing letter accusing forces۝ in the White House of working against Trump۪s agenda. However, a White House official told Yahoo News that Gorka did not leave of his own accord. Sebastian Gorka did not resign, but I can confirm he no longer works at the White House,۝ the official said. According to the Washington Examiner۪s Sarah Westwood, Gorka said it was disappointing۝ that the White House said he was fired, because I resigned.۝ A source with knowledge of the situation said Gorka did indeed resignbut only after being informed on Friday by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly that his security clearance had been revoked, which would have made it impossible for him to continue in his White House job. Gorka was on vacation at the time and due to return on Monday. Instead, after hearing from Kelly, he submitted his resignation. Gorka, who did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Yahoo News, was a controversial and curious figure in the White House. He styled himself as Dr.۝ Sebastian Gorka (he had a doctorate in political science from a Hungarian university) and described himself as a national security expert and intelligence analyst. However, experts in the field questioned his credentials. Gorka frequently appeared on television to defend the Trump administration, but his actual responsibilities within the West Wing were unclear. He also had ties to anti-Semitic groups in Hungary, from which his parents had fled after the failed 1956 uprising against the Soviet-backed regime. Gorka۪s departure comes during a turbulent period for the White House that has seen several top staffers leave including former chief strategist Steve Bannon. The changes have come after John Kelly, a former Marine General, was installed as White House chief of staff last month. Kelly, who was previously Trump۪s secretary of Homeland Security, has been tasked with instilling order in the administration. The ex-general reportedly immediately focused on Bannon as a source of internal disputes and leaks. Bannon was widely seen as Gorka۪s patron. Prior to joining the White House, Gorka worked as an editor at Bannon۪s Breitbart News. Gorka۪s affiliation with the site and his inflammatory commentaries about Muslims earned him a reputation as an alt-right voice in Trump۪s White House. In the wake of his departure, Bannon returned to Breitbart where he hopes to take on the administration۪s enemies and guide Trump۪s agenda from the outside. Gorka۪s alleged resignation letter published by The Federalist expressed a similar desire. It is clear to me that forces that do not support the MAGA promise are  for now  ascendant within the White House,۝ Gorka wrote. As a result, the best and most effective way I can support you, Mr. President, is from outside the People۪s House.۝ As news of his departure broke, Gorka edited the biography on his Twitter page to remove his White House affiliation.

Tillerson is also reportedly working behind the scenes to salvage the Iran nuclear deal , an agreement Trump has condemned asʉone of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.۝ Additionally, Tillerson has hinted that the U.S. should remain in the Paris climate agreement ۥ a pact Trump backed out of in June. The president said he is open to finding those conditions where we can remain engaged with others on what we all agree is still a challenging issue,۝Tillerson said in September. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster echoed this, adding that the U.S. could possibly re-enter the Paris accord if a  better deal ۝ comes together. The Trump-Tillerson friction extends beyond foreign policy. The president speaks for himself,۝ Tillerson told Fox News in August, following the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Parmely said she and her children were detained for approximately 90 minutes before they were finally free to go. At no point did she ever tell the agents whether she was a citizen, she said. If it would inconvenience too many white people then the system would change, and that۪s really the only time anything changes is when too many white people get inconvenienced, and it۪s not worth enforcing the racist policy anymore,۝ Parmely said."

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-transgender-military_us_597893a9e4b0c95f37605a35","WASHINGTON ۥ President Donald Trump tweeted Wednesday that transgender people will no longer be allowed to serve in the U.S. military in any capacity۝ ۥ a stunning reversal of an Obama-era policy that affects thousands of service members. The move, which ironically comes in the middle of the White House۪s American Heroes Week, was wholly unexpected. It۪s not clear why Trump decided to announce such a significant policy change via Twitter or when it would take effect. His timing in relation to other political events is also odd: He shared the news in the midst of Senate Republicans۪ high-stakes fight to repeal Obamacare this week. Trump claims he made the move after consulting with military experts, despite the Pentagon lifting the ban on transgender service members in 2016 after an exhaustive review of its military readiness policies. Our mission is to defend this country, and we don۪t want barriers unrelated to a person۪s qualification to serve preventing us from recruiting or retaining the soldier, sailor, airman or Marine who can best accomplish the mission,۝ then-Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said. We have to have access to 100% of America۪s population for our all-volunteer force to be able to recruit from among them the most highly qualified  and to retain them.۝ The biggest question is what the news means for the thousands of transgender men and women currently serving in the military.There are between 1,320 and 6,630 transgender people in active military service, a Rand Corp. study estimates. Another group, the Palm Center, put the number as high as 15,500 a few years ago. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders couldn۪t give any details later Wednesday when she was asked what will happen to the transgender troops currently serving overseas or when the ban will take effect. During her daily press briefing, she repeatedly said the White House and the Defense Department will work out those specifics. Asked about Trump۪s pledge as a candidate to fight for the LGBTQ community, Sanders said his decision to ban transgender troops was about military readiness۝ and that the president has been very clear he۪s committed to fighting for all Americans.۝ As more questions poured in, Sanders said she would end the briefing if reporters didn۪t ask about other topics. If those are the only questions we have, we۪re going to call it a day,۝ she said. The Pentagon has been referring all questions about the change to the White House. One thing that is clear is that conservatives have been gunning for this change. The right-wing Family Research Council was among the first out with a statement praising Trump for taking the step. I applaud President Trump for keeping his promise to return to military priorities ۥ and not continue the social experimentation of the Obama era that has crippled our nation۪s military,۝ said the group۪s president,Tony Perkins. The military can now focus its efforts on preparing to fight and win wars rather than being used to advance the Obama social agenda.۝ Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.), who unsuccessfully tried to deny hormone therapy and gender transition-related care to transgender troops during debate on a defense spending bill this month, also hailed Trump for being concerned about the cost of providing care to transgender service members. But those costs are incredibly low:Rand Corp. estimates 30 to 140 people would seek new hormone treatments per year, and 25 to 130 would seek gender transition-related surgeries. That amounts to a 0.04 to 0.13 percent increase in the Defense Department۪s total health care spending, per Rand. The American Medical Association has emphasized the medical necessity of mental health care, hormone therapy and gender-transition surgery as forms of therapeutic treatment for people diagnosed with gender dysphoria, a serious medical condition۝ that stems from the distress a person feels when his or her gender identity does not correspond with his or her birth sex. Not all transgender people are diagnosed with gender dysphoria; some don۪t experience that distress. LGBTQ rights groups slammed Trump for making the change solely to appease his conservative base. This has been studied extensively, and the consensus is clear: There are no cost or military readiness drawbacks associated with allowing trans people to fight for their country,۝ said Joshua Block, senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union۪s LGBT & HIV Project. The president is trying to score cheap political points on the backs of military personnel who have put their lives on the line for their country.۝ Gregory Angelo, the president of Log Cabin Republicans, a group that represents LGBTQ conservatives, said Trump۪s move smacks of politics, pure and simple.۝ The United States military already includes transgender individuals who protect our freedom day in and day out,۝ Angelo said. Excommunicating transgender soldiers only weakens our readiness; it doesn۪t strengthen it.۝ The president۪s action completely contradicts his 2016 campaign claims about being better for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans than his Democratic opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . Trump dodged the draft a total of five times, once arguing he couldn۪t serve in the U.S. military because of bone spurs in his heels.

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-popularity-poll_us_596e5bc5e4b0000eb1967c73","Hillary Clinton is even less popular now than when she was running for president. Just 39 percent of Americans view Clinton favorably, according to a Bloomberg national poll conducted last week and released on Monday. A year ago, when Clinton was the presumptive Democratic nominee, her favorability was at 43 percent. The former secretary of state is viewed slightly more negatively than President Donald Trump , who has historically low poll numbers for a president this early in his administration. That puts Clinton at odds with every losing presidential candidate since 1992. Except for Clinton, the defeated candidate saw an increase in favorability ratings after Election Day, according to Gallup data . The Bloomberg poll didn۪t get into reasons for Clinton۪s decline in favorability. But there is, of course, one thing that sets her apart from the pack of failed candidates: Clinton is a woman. In follow-up interviews, Bloomberg poll respondents said their negative feelings about Clinton had nothing to do with her loss. Instead, they emphasized how unlikable they consider Clinton ۥ echoing the opinions of many voters during the 2016 campaign. She did not feel authentic or genuine to me,۝ Chris Leininger, 29, an insurance agent from Fountain Valley, California, told Bloomberg. She was hard to like.۝ That۪s neither an unusual nor a surprising sentiment. Women with strong ambitions and opinions typically take a likability hit, Colleen Ammerman, director of Harvard Business School۪s Gender Initiative, told HuffPost. A mountain of research on women leaders has found that the idea of a powerful woman runs counter to most people۪s expectations for what۪s considered feminine ۥ quiet, supportive, nurturing and definitely not ambitious. The disconnect puts female leaders in what۪s known as the double-bind ۥ strong bosses are penalized for not acting like women,۝ and those who lean the other way and try to display more characteristically feminine traits are penalized for being weak leaders. Clinton۪s probably the best-known example of this phenomenon. She۪s been criticized for being too loud, but also for smiling too much. In the past, Clinton۪s favorability ratings tended to go up when she was not actively running for office. In December 2012, when she was secretary of state, 70 percent of Americans viewed Clinton positively , according to Bloomberg. But since her loss in November, Clinton has stayed in the public eye and has continued to voice her opinions. That۪s likely stoked anxiety and discomfort among Americans, Ammerman said. Clinton opened up about why she thinks she lost to Trump in an interview in April with New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, and again in May in an interview with CNN۪s Christiane Amanpour at a conference. Clinton said she took personal responsibility for her defeat, but also cited the last-minute announcement from then-FBI Director James Comey of a reopened investigation into her emails as a decisive factor in Trump۪s victory. She۪s not the only one who۪s cited Comey۪s letter as a potent October surprise leading to her loss. Yet the comments were met with rage and disbelief from certain corners, writes Rebecca Traister in New York magazine . Here۪s how Gersh Kuntzman put it in the Daily News : Hey, Hillary Clinton, shut the fۥۥ up and go away already.۝ New York Times politics reporter Glenn Thrush tweeted mea culpa-not so much.۝ Countless others rage-tweeted at Clinton ۥ the audacity of her trying to analyze her loss. Ammerman said there was an element of gendered backlash in the response. Clinton۪s willingness to be vocal about being ambitious and wanting to win did little to endear her to the Americans already uncomfortable with a woman audacious enough to want to be president. It۪s hard not to see the sexism in the response, though certainly many of these men aren۪t aware of it. The idea that she shouldn۪t mention the Comey letter when the entire nation and the most respected statisticians are considering its impact is so strange,۝ Amanpour told Traister later. If she were a man, would she be allowed to mention it? As a woman, I am offended by the double standards applied here. Everyone shrieks that Hillary was a bad candidate, but was Trump a good candidate?۝ You could argue that we live in a highly polarized time, and perhaps that۪s why public opinion has not bounced back in Clinton۪s favor. But other Democrats haven۪t taken a popularity hit. In fact, former President Barack Obama and Vice President Biden have both seen their favorability ratings rise since November in Bloomberg۪s polling. Most losing presidential candidates have an easier time and a more generous reception from the public. Former Massachusetts Gov.Mitt Romney, who largely disappeared from view after he lost the 2012 presidential election, saw a 4-point increase in favorability after his defeat. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz) stayed in the public eye as a senator after his presidential loss in 2008, and his numbers shot up significantly. Before the election, 50 percent of Americans viewed him favorably. After he lost to Obama, McCain۪s favorability rose to 64 percent. To be sure, none of those men lost to Trump, an inexperienced and incompetent political leader feared and disliked by a bipartisan array of people. And, as Traister pointed out, it۪s easy and natural to blame the whole Trump thing on Clinton, rather than to dissect the myriad other reasons for his rise. It۪s painful to re-litigate the election for a lot of people ۥ though Trump certainly keeps trying ۥ and maybe that contributes to the feeling of wanting Clinton to just disappear. Having lived through the 2000 election, I don۪t remember this level of vitriol and blame leveled at Al Gore ۥ arguably as stiff and awkward a presidential candidate as Clinton. Indeed, just seven years after his loss to George W. Bush ۥ at a time when the country was struggling under that administration ۥ Gore won a Nobel Peace Prize. There۪s more to the Clinton negativity than Trump backlash, as this Bloomberg poll makes clear. One poll respondent, 46-year-old Robert Taylor, voted for Clinton and said in a followup interview that he doesn۪t blame her for Trump. I think my negativity about her would be there whether Trump was elected or not,۝ he said. Right. The Bloomberg poll was conducted by Selzer & Co. It surveyed 1,001 adults from July 8 to July 12, using live interviewers to reach both landlines and cellphones."

Trump traveled to Alabama just last Friday to headline a raucous rally touting Strange. A McConnell-aligned super PAC spent millions of dollars to help the senator, who was appointed earlier this year to the seat vacated by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. And in a final push on behalf of Strange, Vice President Mike Pence campaigned with him at a closing rally Monday night in Birmingham, the state۪s largest city. It all turned out for naught, with Moore۪s victory dealing a bitter blow to the GOP۪s establishment wing. His win comes at a critical time as Republican lawmakers in Washington struggle to unite around key legislative goals on health care and taxes. The Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC tied to McConnell that spent vast sums on Strange۪s behalf, conceded defeat before the results were officially called. While we were honored to have fought hard for Big Luther, Judge Roy Moore won this nomination fair and square and he has our support, as it is vital that we keep this seat in Republican hands,۝ Senate Leadership Fund President Steven Law said in a statement. Strange was seen by McConnell and other GOP Senate leaders as a reliable member of their caucus.Moore, meanwhile, has reveled in casting himself as an outsider. And in solidly Republican Alabama, he is a prohibitive favorite to win the Dec. 12 special election against Democrat Doug Jones. Trump carried the Cotton State overwhelmingly in last year۪s presidential election, but Strange۪s rebuke casts doubt on his clout just eight months into his presidency ۥ which could signal troubles ahead for his party in next year۪s midterm elections. Trump himself, at last week۪s rally, conceded he may have made a mistake in his pick and bemoaned that a Strange loss would be depicted as a total embarrassment۝ for him. He also pledged to campaign for Moore in the event of a Strange loss. Moore successfully turned the nomination race into a referendum on McConnell while casting himself as pro-Trump, despite not having the president۪s backing. He effectively portrayed Strange۪s association with McConnell as an example of the Washington swamp۝ that Trump has frequently derided and that many of the president allies believe is thwarting his legislative priorities. President Trump۪s being cut off in his office. He۪s being redirected by people like McConnell who do not support his agenda ۥ who will not support his agenda in the future,۝ Moore said during a debate with Strange last Thursday. Moore, 70, is a staunch conservative who has made a litany of contentious statements over the years. He became known nationally for his refusal to remove a monument of the Ten Commandments from the Alabama Judicial Building ۥ a stance that led to his ouster as chief justice of the state۪s Supreme Court in 2003. He won election to that office again in 2012, but was suspended from it last year after ordering state judges not to grant same-sex marriage licenses despite the U.S. Supreme Court۪s nationwide legalization of such unions. Moore has been particularly vocal on LGBTQ issues ۥ saying in 2005 that homosexual conduct should be illegal.۝ Strange, 64, had little success making a dent in the core of support for Moore, who appeared as impervious to attacks as Trump . Ads financed by the McConnell-linked super PAC disputed Moore۪s conservative credentials. And on the eve of Tuesday۪s vote, Strange upped the ante by comparing Moore to Todd Akin, the failed 2012 Senate GOP candidate in Missouri. Akin had been favored to win his race until he told an interviewer that pregnancy rarely occurs as a result of what he called legitimate rape.۝ In an interview Monday with The Washington Examiner, Strange said that ۥ like Akin ۥ Moore would prove an anchor around the neck۝ of other Republicans because of his views. Still, Moore led in every public poll preceding Tuesday۪s vote. Strange struggled to overcome his link to Robert Bentley, the widely disliked former Alabama governor who appointed him to the Senate in February. As Alabama۪s attorney general, Strange faced accusations of stalling an investigation into Bentley, who resigned in April amid a sex scandal. Tuesday۪s vote was set up after Moore finished first and Strange second in a 10-candidate GOP primary last month. They faced off because neither received more than 50 percent of the vote in that first round of voting. The runoff campaign spotlighted divisions in the Republican Party in the Trump era. Steve Bannon, who left his White House job as Trump۪s chief strategist in mid-August and returned to his prior post of running the conservative website Breitbart News, marshaled anti-establishment forces ۥincluding former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin ۥ against Strange. And Bannon teamed up with Moore for a rally Monday night near Mobile, Alabama. We did not come here to defy Donald Trump, we came here to praise and honor him,۝ Bannon told the crowd. A vote for Judge Roy Moore is a vote for Donald J. Trump.۝ Jones, the 63-year-old Democratic nominee, has an impressive record. As a U.S. attorney in Alabama in 1997, he led the successful prosecution of two of the Ku Klux Klan members responsible for bombing Birmingham۪s 16th Street Baptist Church on Sept. 15, 1963, in which four girls were killed. His campaign also got a boost last week when former Vice President Joe Biden announced he would stump for him. So far, Jones has not faced much scrutiny. He  hasn۪t had any single negative ad run against him yet,۝ Alabama radio talk show host Dale Jackson said. He added that Jones was a defense attorney for a long time,۝ suggesting that the Democrat۪s past caseload could become fodder during the general election campaign. No Democrat has won a Senate election in Alabama since 1992. And that senator ۥ Richard Shelby, who remains in office ۥ switched to the GOP in 1994. Democrats said they plan to tie other Republicans to Moore۪s most controversial actions and statements, arguing that his candidacy will be a drag on the GOP across the country. Judge Roy Moore is unfit for office, and his primary victory means huge problems for Republicans across the country,۝ said Joshua Karp, a spokesman for Democratic opposition research group American Bridge. Every Republican should have to answer for Moore۪s extreme views and disgusting statements.۝"
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dean-heller-health-care_us_597b57c4e4b02a4ebb752633","Sen. Dean Heller blew it. It۪s hard to imagine a more terrible way for a moderate like the Nevada Republican to handle an extremely unpopular piece of legislation like the Senate health care bill, which went down in flames early Friday. At just about every turn over the past few weeks, the vulnerable senator who faces re-election next year danced haphazardly from one position to the other and everywhere in between. By enthusiastically embracing criticisms of the bill while simultaneously voting to advance it several times, Heller may have seriously damaged his reputation among liberals and conservatives. Unlike other GOP senators who expressed concern about repealing too much of Obamacare, such as Rob Portman of Ohio and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Heller had put on a show back home. In a widely televised June press conference alongside popular Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval (R), Heller sharply criticized an initial version of the Senate GOP health care bill, known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act. I cannot support a piece of legislation that takes insurance away from tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Nevadans,۝ he said . To his credit, Heller joined nine other Republicans in voting down that bill on Tuesday. But when Republicans drew up a more narrowly tailored version of the legislation, known as the Health Care Freedom Act, Heller was all over the place. Overall I think I۪d support it,۝ he said Wednesday morning, before shifting gears the next day to  undecided .۝ In the end, Heller on Friday morning voted for a bill that, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would have left 16 million fewer Americans with health coverage and raised premiums by 20 percent over the next 10 years. He also broke with Sandoval and nine other governors who declared their opposition to the bill just hours before the vote. Some of Heller۪s legislative maneuvering designed to insulate him from criticism back home also backfired. A symbolic amendment he introduced that expressed the Senate۪s support for Medicaid, while also repealing Obamacare, was voted down 10-90 ۥ the only such bipartisan vote on a health care measure all week. It was not legally binding and hence little more than a messaging tactic. Heller۪s office made sure to tout the measure in a press release titled, Heller on Senate Floor: Health Care Reform Cannot be Balanced on the Backs of Nevada۪s Low-Income Families.۝ In deciding how to vote on the health care bill, Heller arguably faced a more difficult political calculus than other GOP moderates, including Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Unlike the others, Heller is likely to face a strong primary challenge from his right. And he has already been threatened by ads from a group supportive of President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, Rep. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), who۪s running for Heller۪s seat, wasted no time ripping into him for his vote on Friday. No politician from our state has ever been more dishonest about their intentions, more misleading about their position or more disingenuous to their constituents,۝ Rosen said in a statement. This was the biggest broken political promise in modern Nevada history.۝"

And its population of nearly 30 million is largely young and often vulnerable to terrorist recruitment, as striking levels of volunteering and fundraising for the self-described Islamic State and al Qaeda have shown. Despite the risks, Mohammed bin Salman, the 32-year-old Saudi king-to-be, has spent close to three years pushing the kingdom to change in unprecedented ways  to forcefully intervene abroad, as it has to brutal effect in neighboring Yemen , to open up its state-dominated economy to entrepreneurs and foreign capital, and above all, to embrace rule by one near-omnipotent leader. The crown prince is likely to see at least some success. But officials and experts monitoring the kingdom are increasingly worried about his methods. If Mohammed bin Salman pushes too hard, he could shatter his societyʉۥ and unleash a nightmare. Since Nov. 4, the prince has accelerated his campaign. His new anti-corruption agency has arrested hundreds of prominent Saudis ۥ including royal family members like recently released Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, the son of the previous king and former head of the powerful National Guard, and noted billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal ۥ as well as dozens of military officers and private businessmen like construction magnate Bakr Binladin . At least 17 detainees have needed medical attention because of abuse , according to The New York Times, and Saudi authorities say they seek to confiscate much of the wealth these figures accumulated  securing hundreds of billions of dollars to fund Mohammed bin Salman۪s agenda. The prince is aware of international anxiety about Saudi stability. In interviews with important Westerners like Thomas Friedman of The New York Times, he suggests that he shares that concern. Mohammed bin Salman۪s argument is that collapse would be likely ۥ even inevitable ۥ without his plans. He cites goals reformist Saudis and outsiders have long said Riyadh must adopt: ending endemic corruption, encouraging Saudis to be less dependent on the state with his Vision 2030 economic strategy , and discouraging ultra-conservative interpretations of Islam. Changing Saudi Arabia for the better means helping the region and changing the world. So this is what we are trying to do here. And we hope we get support from everyone,۝ the prince told The Guardian in October. But he۪s also fundamentally changing the methods his country has relied on to avert catastrophe. The [Saudi] system itself is in many ways built around trying to ensure stability,۝ Derek Chollet, who has served in top positions at the White House, Pentagon and State Department since the 1990s, told HuffPost. Consider the last time Saudi Arabia had a hostile army on its borders. It didn۪t announce a response for six days. You had King Fahd, but you had Crown Prince Abdullah, the head of the National Guard; Prince Sultan, the head of the defense ministry; Prince Nayef, head of the interior ministry; and Prince Saud Al-Faisal at the foreign ministry,۝ said F. Gregory Gause, an expert on the Persian Gulf at Texas A&M University. These were all senior members of the family. They all had a voice in what went on,۝ Gause continued, adding, the king had to, if not get a consensus, at least consult around with various people. So if we look at 1990, which is relatively well-documented from the American side, we know that the Saudis for days didn۪t acknowledge that the Iraqis had invaded Kuwait because they hadn۪t come to a decision on how to handle it.۝ That consensus-based system  which King Salman, the crown prince۪s father, once described to American interviewer Karen Elliott House as Saudi Arabia۪s answer to democracy  dominated the kingdom۪s politics for decades. Saudi Arabians do not choose representatives who can truly influence the policies of their king. Saudi courts have little judicial independence. And the regime۪s domestic critics have never wielded real power. Sons of the founder of the modern Saudi state, including King Salman, have ruled in succession since 1953, and various brothers, sons and cousins have developed independent power centers by running various aspects of the sprawling government. The chief checks and balances on any rulers of the kingdom were traditionally within the top tier of the thousands-strong royal family. With last month۪s arrests, Mohammed bin Salman signaled that the old system is dead. The prince had already slashed the power of the kingdom۪s religious establishment , the one institution in the country that can claim as central a role in Saudi history as the royal family, and jailed more than 30 clerics, intellectuals and activists. Now high-ranking sources in the kingdom say they are afraid of growing surveillance. The prince has consolidated power in a way unknown to the kingdom since the the age of his grandfather in the 1930s and ۪40s. Experts say his goal is to show the only way to thrive in Saudi Arabia is to be loyal to his agenda and to him personally. But it۪s unclear what comes next, and why there should be any confidence that it will work. If you think you can change Saudi society without the religious types enthusiastically behind you, without the rich people supporting you and by marginalizing this huge network of regime support that the ruling family represented, that۪s a risky path,۝ Gause, the Texas A&M professor, told HuffPost. The Saudi government۪s response to those doubts is firm: We know what we۪re doing. The pace of change has changed due to the young and dynamic leadership in addition to the young and educated population,۝ Fatimah Baeshen, the spokeswoman for the Saudi Embassy in Washington, told HuffPost in a recent email. Vision 2030 set long-term aims and also creates a platform for everyone to contribute, both of which ensure the country۪s sustainability,۝ she added. There is a symbiotic relationship between public sentiment and ongoing public discourse which informs policy development. This helps set the pace and ensures stability.۝ Mohammed bin Salman can rely on significant support. His anti-corruption rhetoric resonates with millions of Saudis who feel that the elite have fleeced state oil revenues, as well as with businesspeople around the world who are frustrated with unaccountable Saudi partners. It would be a mistake to dismiss all authoritarian efforts to clean up government as little more than political theater,۪۝ analysts Andrew Leber and Christopher Carothers wrote of the crackdown in Saudi Arabia, suggesting it might lead to long-lasting and positive reforms. The prince۪s decision to allow Saudi women to drive and to defang the kingdom۪s long-feared religious police will likely also pay dividends. He gets lots of people because of these cards, [like the] social liberalism card,۝said Hala Aldosari, a Saudi rights activist and current fellow at Harvard۪s Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. For Saudis, this is a gain, even if it means this is a gain being made for political reasons, to present himself as the visionary leader more appropriate for relations with the West.۝ Mohammed bin Salman۪s approach of strategically reducing global oil supplies (and even Saudi market share) to keep prices high recently helped boost Saudi foreign reserves for the first time in months, and there are high expectations for the anticipated payouts to the treasury, courtesy of his anti-corruption drive and the income Riyadh can gain from publicly listing part of its state-owned oil company. The same month as the crackdown,Saudi Arabia۪s non-oil private sector grew at its quickest pace in two years, a recent economic survey showed . But blunders are inevitable. The question is how big they۪ll be. One possibility is that the prince won۪t be able to pull off most of the change he۪s gunning for, will decide that it۪s impossible, and will fall into old, self-destructive Saudi habits. There are already signs he will have to slow-roll attempted cuts to public benefits. To Aldosari, a former government consultant, Mohammed bin Salman۪s challenges to the old system don۪t even seem as sweeping as many have suggested. It۪s not a change of structure, it۪s a change of approach: how to distribute power,۝ she told HuffPost. She envisages the prince setting up his own new (if smaller) club of inevitably corrupt elites to replace the old guard, and believes he۪ll ultimately be seen as more personally linked to Saudi government policy than previous kings ۥ and therefore, more likely to be blamed when things go wrong. Saudis have blasted Mohamad bin Salman۪s response to recent floods in Jeddah, the kingdom۪s second-largest city, noting that he۪d promised accountability measures that would force corrupt officials to actually spend government money on infrastructure to prevent such flooding. His anti-corruption credentials have also suffered because of The Wall Street Journal۪s revelation that he spent close to half a billion dollars on a Leonardo da Vinci painting in October. It remains unclear how much money he and his branch of the royal family have made over the years. If Mohammed bin Salman chooses to mostly follow the path of previous kings, simply modifying it to accommodate his desire to have more personal control, the system could become even more repressive, Aldosari said, with the human rights community losing one potential check on the king۪s prerogative. In the past, she explained, royals with influence sometimes intervened on activists۪behalf, as Prince Alwaleed did when he urged lighter prison sentences for women arrested for challenging the driving restrictions. An even darker future may come to pass if Mohammed bin Salman۪s plans backfire dramatically. The lack of due process in the targeting of notable Saudis has already spooked the international investors he۪s hoping to court and the powerful figures at home who are now exploring ways to protect their assets because they think they might be next. There۪s a chance the decisive boom in non-oil Saudi business he۪s waiting for just won۪t come ۥ and the country will be left with shrunken government reserves from his surrendering of Saudi market share in the oil trade, as well as a population angry about failed promises and slashed benefits. Unlike previous Saudi monarchs, Mohammed bin Salman also won۪t be able to rely on a system historically proven to manage dissent when he is king. He۪s scared off potential challengers for now, but experts believe anger might linger, particularly in agencies like the interior ministry that have long been controlled by branches of the royal family that he has sidelined. That resentment could fuel private scheming to thwart the king-to-be, perhaps after he loses his father۪s protection and lays his own claim to the throne. It could even inspire direct assaults, like the assassination attempt that claimed King Faisal۪s life in 1975, or the violent takeover of the holy complex in Mecca in 1979 by ultraconservative militants. Wealthy Saudis have long been willing to fund men with guns ۥ including extremists, as in the cases of al Qaeda and ISIS, which have both pledged to overthrow the Saudi regime. It۪s not hard to imagine some turning to that tactic again, perhaps even boosting internal pockets of resistance like the persecuted Shiite community in the oil-rich Eastern Province. A Saudi civil war would be a brutal affair ۥ one directly implicating and endangering the West, given how much American and European weaponry is in the kingdom and how Middle East security vacuums have proven to shelter militants planning attacks thousands of miles away. Internal fissures could also lead Mohammed bin Salman to wreak havoc beyond the kingdom۪s borders.His efforts against regional rival Iran have already brought millions to the brink of famine in Yemen and proven haphazard, unsettling and counterproductive,۝ according to International Institute for Strategic Studies analyst Emile Hokayem. The bitterness he۪s inspired among traditionally Saudi-friendly Sunni Muslims in Lebanon by forcing the televised humiliation of their leader ۥ in Saudi Arabia, no less ۥ is a potent example. But using foreign interventions to stoke Saudi nationalism is one of the prince۪s favored tactics to shore up support, Aldosari told HuffPost. The kingdom may embark on more messy, internationally condemned adventures abroad ۥ and it۪s unclear how they will end. Well-connected former CIA official Bruce Riedel recently told a Washington audience that the prince۪s foreign policy has failed to account for any way out of the crises he has created so far. The widely held view among observers of the region, including some fierce critics of the kingdom and the prince, is that it would be best for the kingdom and the world if Mohammed bin Salman۪s big gamble were to work out. The expectation of relative stability has been part of the foundation of U.S.-Saudi relations, analysts Michael Stephens and Thomas Juneau wrote in 2016. Chollet, the former U.S. official now at the German Marshall Fund think tank, told HuffPost he recalled anxiety among Obama aides in 2011 and 2012 when then-King Abdullah۪s health began to falter and it appeared that the Saudi succession might become problematic. He counts himself as one of many in Washington rooting for Mohammed bin Salman to succeed, but unsure if he can. When Riyadh errs, Chollet said, Washington has some leverage to spur better judgment, but sometimes not enough. And under President Donald Trump, who has loudly praised Mohammed bin Salman۪s purges and whose son-in-law Jared Kushner is enamored with the prince, even limited cautioning seems unlikely. A U.S. official working on the region recently described the White House as unwilling to hear criticism of Mohammed bin Salman۪s choices, and said the only prospect of a change is if the famously fickle U.S. president one day simply changes his mind on his own. In many ways, [Trump and the Saudi royals] feel very familiar to one another,۝ Chollet said, joking, They have the same interior decorator.۝ Some seasoned Saudi watchers say the young king-in-waiting is adjusting course. Official Washington was very pleased with a report last month from Washington Post grandee David Ignatius that suggested Mohammed bin Salman seeks calm resolutions to his November surprises ۥ the corruption arrests and the Lebanese prime minister۪s since-reversed resignation announcement ۥ by settling with detainees out of court and reiterating Saudi support for the U.S.-backed national army of Lebanon. But there۪s still anxiety in the air. Regime stability is an enduring concern,۝ Chollet said. Instability in Saudi Arabia does not stay in Saudi Arabia.۝"
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nazi-punch-antifa_us_59e13ae9e4b03a7be580ce6f","WASHINGTONʉۥ There is a growing desire in this country to punch Nazis in the face. At least, this is what I hear from people who punch Nazis in the face. Some gleefully send me videos of other people punching Nazis in the face, such as the one from September featuring a Nazi in Seattle who threw a banana at a man and, in return, ate a very professional right cross. The Nazi fell to the ground and lay there unconscious. When he came to, he removed his Nazi armband and shuffled off. Anyone following the news knows who۪s doing the bulk of this Nazi-punching: antifa.۝ It۪s an esoteric and often confounding term. Although short for anti-fascist۝  an expansive category that one would imagine includes millions of Americans  antifa۝ has quickly come to connote a very specific stereotype: a black-clad, violent, leftist subversive. Most Americans first learned about antifa in February, when what looked like a gang of ninjas set fires and broke windows to stop Milo Yiannopoulos,a race-baiting former Breitbart News editor, from speaking on the University of California, Berkeley campus, where he reportedly intended to out undocumented students. About a week after the deadly white supremacist riot in Charlottesville, Virginia, President Donald Trump seized on antifa as Exhibit A in his ongoing efforts to blame both sides۝ for the violence. During a speech in Phoenix, Trump played up the word۪s alien vibrations as if he were, to borrow a Trevor Noah joke, introducing a band at the Latin Grammys: An-TEE-fa!۝ Their notoriety may be new, but antifa have a long, complicated history of militant community activism. This history has involved a lot of Nazi-punching, but it۪s also about much more than that. In the course of my reporting on the alt-right over the past year, I۪ve talked to several older anti-fascists who have been doing the work۝ for decades. They told me about pitched battles in the street with Nazis from another era, about raiding Klan rallies under cover of darkness, about cops in cahoots with white supremacists, and about Nazis torching the homes of activists and killing antifa in the desert. I heard about duffel bags filled with barbells and knives and a legendary anti-fascist who was attacked by a brass-knuckle-wielding Nazi and responded by breaking the fascist۪s teeth with a Maglite flashlight. These exploits sounded fantastical, but when I looked into them, they were true. The antifa vets were more strategic than I anticipated and obsessively knowledgeable about politics. They all had extreme personalities, although time had precipitated out a little of their tannin. Some had children and normal lives. The Maglite legend, I۪d heard, was now a kids۪ soccer coach. Still, they were tight-lipped about their activities, some of which were illegal, and were often misunderstood. Anti-facism is a loose-knit, decentralized movement containing numerous organizations and ideologies that even insiders struggle to explain. For starters, not all people who identify as anti-fascists describe themselves as antifa. Most antifa are anarchists, but there are also socialists and communists, who divide further into Maoists, Marxists, Trotskyists and Stalinist tankies.۝ What unites them is a belief that dangerous elements of the far right must be driven from the public square, even if by force. And for two decades, beginning in the mid-1980s, that۪s what antifa attempted to do, almost entirely out of the public eye. They put neo-Nazis and other white supremacists on their heels in cities and suburbs around the country, forcing many of them underground or into retreat. (Other contributing factors: litigation by civil rights organizations, the demise of key white supremacist leaders and law enforcement roundups.) Over the past year, as fascists and racists have reemerged, emboldened by the rise of Trump, many old-school antifa have laced up their boots again. But now they find themselves facing a new enemy. The current crop of neo-Nazis and white nationalists prefers tattersall to tattoos and come off more like Young Republicans than Hammerskins. They are proficient in social media and online messaging, which presents a challenge for antifa used to fighting in the shadows. When you have Richard Spencer getting punched in the face, millions of people see it,۝ said Oren Segal, the director of the Anti-Defamation League۪s Center on Extremism. Millions of people might also feel a pang of sympathy for Spencer. Others might use the video to demonize the left or justify a crackdown on public protest. In an age of insta-propaganda, it۪s hard to know: Is punching Nazis actually helping the Nazis? If New Orleans gave us jazz, Minneapolis gave us antifa. Gangs of skinheads scrapping in cold Midwestern alleys  that۪s how organized anti-fascism in America was born, in the counter-culture punk scene of the 1980s. The skinheads listened to ska and punk and wore steel-toed Doc Martens and Fred Perry shirts. The original skinhead movement was multiracial and working class, and it drew heavily from Jamaican rude boy۝ culture. But in the 1980s, white power groups invaded the scene, giving rise to thousands of boneheads۝  neo-Nazi skinheads. In Minneapolis, one bonehead set called the White Knights started beating up minority kids and menacing leftists in the punk rock crowd. It was stomp or get stomped, and a multiracial crew of traditional۝ skins called the Baldies decided to fight back. The Baldies۪ turf was the Uptown neighborhood. If the Baldies caught Nazis in Uptown, they۪d tell them to leave. If the Nazis didn۪t leave, the Baldies put a hurt on them. The White Knights cleared out of Uptown. Before long, they cleared out of Minneapolis. In 1987, the Baldies joined with other leftist and anarchist activists to form Anti-Racist Action, which would become the mother organization for anti-fascism in America. The ARA focused not only on neighborhood Nazis but also on systemic racism. We go where they go۝ was the ARA۪s first guiding principle, and the organization۪s tactics evolved beyond fisticuffs. ARA members painted over racist graffiti and disrupted the sales of white power music. They put out political literature, held demonstrations and did door knocks, volunteered in schools to educate kids about racism, protested wars and did environmental activism and labor organizing. One of the ARA۪s priorities was defending reproductive rights. Members regularly stood guard outside abortion clinics, which the far right menaced with Nazi muscle. The ARA also pioneered a tactic known today as doxing  exposing fascists and racists in order to shame them in their communities. Back then, it was a lot more labor-intensive. When you see someone passing out white supremacist flyers or not getting prosecuted for hate crimes, you dig deeper and try to find out who the person is,۝ explains an anti-fascist in western Pennsylvania with two decades of experience who goes by Lady. We would make a list of their actions against our friends, neighbors and the community. We۪d write it into a little story and put it on a flyer with a picture of them we۪d usually have to snap ourselves. Then we۪d walk around their community and put the flyer on light poles and cars. We۪d usually call it something like, Meet your neighborhood racist.۪۝ To ARA members, there was no point expecting help from the cops, many of whom antifa knew were themselves racist. And they dismissed liberals as the same kind of pearl-clutching appeasers who۪d allowed Hitler and Mussolini to seize power in the 1930s. Antifa would go it alone. By 1998, ARA reportedly had more than 100 chapters and 2,000 members across North America, as well as several newspapers and a hotline to receive tips about white supremacists. Its policy on fascists was simple: Don۪t allow white supremacists any platform to normalize a violent ideology. As Gerry Bello, a longtime member of Columbus ARA in Ohio,put it: Hitler himself said the only way you could have beaten us if you۪d smashed us off the street from the very first day and with the utmost brutality.۝ Antifa weren۪t exaggerating the threat of violence. Many remember the night in 1998 when two women lured Dan Shersty and Lin Spit۝ Newborn, two ARA members, into the desert near Las Vegas. Instead of a party, the young antifa found a group of neo-Nazis. According to media accounts, Shersty was barely out of his car when a gun blast opened up his chest. The fascists dragged Newborn deeper into the desert and shot him to pieces. Only one of the neo-Nazis, John Polar Bear۝ Butler, was convicted of the murders. Another person later took a plea deal. The violence, however, cut both ways. Although antifa tended to show more restraint on the battlefield, they still put plenty of Nazis in the hospital. Shit happens,۝ Bello explains. These are fights involving weapons. Sometimes one of them will catch a right proper boot party. There۪s quite a few times where if we wanted to put them in the morgue they would be in the morgue.۝ Perhaps the first time that antifa really entered public view was during the protests against globalization at the 1999 World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle, when a small contingent of masked anarchists in black famously smashed up police cars and the windows of corporate offices in acts of symbolic violence.۝ (Many antifa view capitalism as an engine of systemic racism.) The Battle of Seattle۝ was essentially the American debut of the black bloc۝ tactic, which was first used in Germany. The idea was that if the entire bloc dressed in black and wore masks, a few activists could vandalize property and then blend anonymously back into the ensemble, making it almost impossible for police to figure out whom to arrest. From that point, black bloc became the de facto uniform for antifa when they deployed in large groups. Like they did in York, a small blue-collar city in south-central Pennsylvania and the site of a historic antifa victory. In 2002, Matt Hale, the leader of a major white supremacist organization, the World Church of the Creator, staged a rally in a mostly black and Latino part of York. His purpose was to support York۪s mayor, Charlie Robertson. At the time, Robertson was under investigation for his connection to a murder that occurred during a deadly race riot in York in the 1960s. Robertson would later admit that while serving as a police officer during the riot, he had shouted White power!۝ to an angry mob. He had also allegedly supplied ammunition to white gang members and told them to kill as many niggers as you can.۝ The gang members shot a black woman to death. None of them was ever charged  but a deathbed confession by one of the gangsters almost 30 years later had finally exposed Robertson۪s involvement. Hale۪s rally drew well over 100 white supremacists to York. Antifa showed up in equivalent or greater numbers, according to multiple participants. As the anti-fascists walked into York, local black teenagers emerged from their homes, ready to join them in battle. Antifa helped them don masks, according to one activist who was there. This is what antifa say they work hardest to achieve: a community empowered to defend itself, with anti-fascists playing a supporting role. Hale was speechifying inside a library, with bonehead foot soldiers posted outside. Riot police and state troopers were there to keep the peace. But when smaller groups of Nazis began slipping off to the side of the library, antifa pursued them through alleys with the guidance of the locals. It broke up into several small unit combats all over the city for hours,۝ Bello says. They have this thing, I۪ve only seen it in York. You know those old metal garbage cans? They had this way to skip them off the ground and have them come up at teeth height.۝ A large group of antifa turned into an alley. Chain-link fence on the left. Brick wall on the right. About 80 feet away down the alley was a cluster of Nazi skinheads. Antifa charged straight for them. A Nazi in a pickup came flying down the alley, according to newspaper accounts and two anti-fascists who were there. He hit two antifa, breaking a teenage girl۪s arm and raking another person down the fence for 20 feet, then screeched out of the alley and bounced a girl as young as 8 off his bumper . To leave town, the white supremacists needed an armed escort from the police for almost a mile. Antifa put the boot to neo-Nazis in other cities, too, such as Toronto, and in the suburbs and edge towns of major metropolises like Columbus, Montreal, Chicago, Detroit and Louisville. Heidi Beirich, an extremism expert at the Southern Poverty Law Center, noted that Rose City Antifa۪s aggressive tactics in Portland, Oregon, drove the dangerous founder of a murderous neo-Nazi gang out of town. They also went after the Klan, often with similar results. By the mid-2000s, with organized white supremacy seemingly on the wane, the ARA national network began to atrophy. People moved on, settled down, shifted their energy to other causes or retired. Then along came Trump. The alt-right might have been active before 2016, but Trump۪s candidacy ushered a new generation of white supremacy onto the national stage. Not since Nixon has a president so openly courted fascists and racists. Antifa I spoke with have reported an uptick of new, younger members in response. And older members are swinging back into action, too, either actively or in quieter, supporting roles. We got motherfuckers coming up out of the bathroom tiles like Terminator 2,۪۝ Bello says. ARA chapters have reorganized across the country, and other groups, such as Redneck Revolt, a pro-worker, anti-racist organization with almost 30 branches nationwide, have readied for action. But while the alt-right might have copped its ideology from old-guard neo-Nazis and Klansmen, many of its leaders are savvy propagandists. And antifa violence is easy for them to exploit, especially when inflicted upon preppy antagonists. To a large extent, the narrative within antifa circles is kind of machismo. It۪s about winning battles against the Nazis,۝ says Cas Mudde,an extremism expert and professor at the University of Georgia. If you actually beat up 25 big, bulky skinheads, the battle has been won. If you beat up Polo-wearing kids in the suburbs, what have you achieved?۝ One ill-considered punch can now obscure the more meritorious blows. Already faded from collective memory are episodes like the one in Charlottesville when antifa fought off baton-wielding white supremacists who were about to attack a line of clergy. ( Antifa saved my life twice on Saturday ,۝ said Rev. Seth Wispelwey, a local minister.) Far more potent are the viral videos, like the one of antifa in Berkeley flattening a MAGA bro. They allow conservatives to brand all antifa as dangerous extremists  in part to create a convenient alibi for their own more dangerous extremists. And far-right extremists are far more dangerous. A report from the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point found that from 1990 to 2012, far-right extremists were responsible for 670 fatalities, 3,053 injuries and 4,420 violent attacks in the United States. No such data exist for antifa, but in the three decades of antifa۪s organized existence in America, only one known fatality caused by a member of an antifa group has been recorded, when in 1993 a multiracial skin shot a Nazi skin during a fight at a gas station in Portland and was convicted of manslaughter. Nevertheless, Trump and others frequently portray the violence as an equal problem on both sides.۝In an ouroboros of political dishonesty, right-wingers have even taken to attacking antifa with comparisons to the most toxic elements of the Republican base. In August, Marc Thiessen, a Washington Post columnist and former staffer for the racist Sen. Jesse Helms, wrote that antifa are no different from neo-Nazis.۝ In September, Attorney General Jeff Sessions likened antifa to the Ku Klux Klan. And then there are extremists such as Gavin McInnes, a Vice co-founder and the leader of the Proud Boys, a Trump-supporting racist fraternity,۝ who consistently tries to brand anti-fascists as fascists.۝ Less than a week after antifa stepped in to protect clergy from violent fascists and white supremacists in Charlottesville, a White House petition was created to declare antifa a terrorist organization. It garnered hundreds of thousands of signatures within days. (The Department of Homeland Security under President Barack Obama had reportedly already classified antifa۪s activities as domestic terrorist violence.۝) At the end of November, Christopher Wray, the FBI director appointed by Trump after the president fired James Comey, told the House Homeland Security Committee that the bureau was investigating a number of peopleʉwho are motivated to commit violent criminal activity on kind of an antifa ideology.۝ By then,far-right propagandists had been smearing antifa for months. Many of them, including Lucian Wintrich, a Gateway Pundit writer who is credentialed by the White House and pals around with white supremacists ,hyped a conspiracy theory about how antifa supersoldiers۝planned to mass-decapitate white parents and start another American civil war. An official magazine of the National Rifle Association published a scare story that depicted antifa as brutal thugs and claimed that when the TV cameras are absent, the far left secretly agrees with [the] goals۝ of this violent, disgusting and destructive۝ movement. If you just look at the discourse today within Breitbart or the NRA or even Tucker Carlson, they make the case that these are the storm troopers of the Democratic Party,۝ Mudde says. It is very problematic in that it distracts from the alt-right, which is already a bit of a distraction from the structural racism in the Republican Party.۝ Some antifa elect to pursue nonviolent tactics as a matter of both practicality and public relations. Daryle Lamont Jenkins runs One People۪s Project, which does deep research into the organizational networks and funding sources of the far right. To Jenkins and other like-minded activists, information warfare is more important than ever as the alt-right tries to insinuate itself into the conservative establishment and the political mainstream. Jenkins has also pulled several Nazis out of the movement and helped rehabilitate them. One of Jenkins۪ longtime colleagues, Laura Sennett, takes it a step further. Sennett is a photographer and middle-aged Jewish suburbanite who lives in the Washington area. She got into activism after covering a neo-Nazi rally in Toledo, Ohio, that turned into a riot. Sometimes when I want to shock people, I say, I۪m an antifa,۪۝ she tells me. ۝And they look me up and down. I۪ve got my regular clothes and my nails and my perfume. I look like an art teacher,۝ she says. But if I tell people I۪m anti-fascist, I get, Oh, that۪s wonderful! More power to you.۪۝ Sennett tries to connect with white supremacists and change how they see the world. The self-described antifa yenta۝ has, for instance, baked cookies for Richard Spencer and tried to sprinkle different ideas into his diet. She is critical of violence for violence۪s sake, particularly what she calls the fuck shit up۝ culture among Berkeley antifa. Their anti-fascism is becoming a tool for fascism. You have to choose between what makes you feel better and what is actually right and effective.۝ But activists like Sennett and Jenkins are a minority. I have been shunned by people in the antifa community because I suggested a diversity of tactics that weren۪t the standard,۝ Sennett says. We۪ve got to do something that۪s violent or vandalism. And for some reason if you do anything that diverts from these kinds of tactics, you۪re a traitor.۝ (Her approach hasn۪t helped her avoid attention from law enforcement: In 2008, the FBI raided Sennett۪s home and seized her computers, cameras and memory cards, seeking pictures she۪d taken of an anarchist demonstration.) If the militant antifa I spoke to were concerned that social media could be used against them, they didn۪t elaborate. No matter how good we are, it۪s going to happen anyway. We۪re going to get vilified,۝ Bello says. Some antifa argued that fisticuff videos simply attract more supporters to their cause. White nationalists made the same argument. Spencer has called the punch he took a good thing because it woke up the whole movement۝ and pushed the alt-right into a new gear. But antifa, too,were in a different gear, with new ARA chapters and other organizations forming around the country. Militant vets view the fight against white supremacists as a war. I don۪t see those two groups standing across from each other 10 to 15 times more and there not being significantly more violence,۝ Mudde says. And then we have a different situation.۝ So what, ultimately, does one old antifa head think is to be done about the scrubbed-up, boy-next-door alt-right?

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-world-leaders-phone-calls_us_59833035e4b06d4888748afa","WASHINGTON ۥ President Donald Trump made several questionable assertions in phone calls with Mexican President Enrique Pe̱a Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull , according to transcripts of the calls obtained by The Washington Post and published Thursday. Here are some of his most egregious claims and remarks made during the conversations, which occurred when he first took office in January. Trump claimed he won New Hampshire in the 2016 election because the state is a drug-infested den.۪ In referencing drugs and the opioid epidemic, Trump falsely claimed to Pe̱a Nieto that he won the Granite State. We have the drug lords in Mexico that are knocking the hell out of our country. They are sending drugs to Chicago, Los Angeles, and to New York, up in New Hampshire  I won New Hampshire because New Hampshire is a drug-infested den  is coming from the southern border,۝ Trump said. We have a massive drug problem where kids are becoming addicted to drugs because drugs are being sold for less money than candy because there is so much of it,۝ he continued. So we have to work together to knock that out.۝ In reality, Trump narrowly lost New Hampshire to his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton . The state۪s two Democratic senators, Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen,on Thursday criticized Trump۪s description of their state and the way in which he appeared to refer callously to the opioid crisis. Trump instructed Pe̱a Nieto to stop publicly refusing to pay for his signature campaign promise, the border wall. Trump portrayed the issue as important for his political prospects , saying not having Mexico pay left him in a political bind.۝ Yet he claimed that this is the least important thing we are talking about.۝ The president told his Mexican counterpart that you cannot say that to the press۝ that Mexico would refuse to pay, a position that Pe̱a Nieto has reiterated. So what I would like to recommend is  if we are going to have continued dialogue  we will work out the wall,۝ Trump said. They are going to say, Who is going to pay for the wall, Mr. President?۪ to both of us. And we should both say, We will work it out.۪ It will work out in the formula somehow. As opposed to you saying, We will not pay۪ and me saying, we will not pay.۪ If you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore because I cannot live with that,۝ Trump added later. He expressed authoritarian desires. Trump hoped Pe̱a Nieto could run again even though he is term-limited. I want you to be so popular that your people will call for a constitutional amendment in Mexico so that you can run again for another six years,۝ he said. Trump also bragged that their relationship would ensure that they will almost become the fathers of our country ۥ almost, not quite, OK?۝ He complained to Turnbull that accepting refugees makes me look bad.۪ Trump told Turnbull that it would be bad۝ for him to honor a previous agreement for the U.S. to accept Syrian refugees, calling himself the world۪s greatest person that does not want to let people into the country.۝ Boy, that will make us look awfully bad,۝ Trump said after he announced his ban on travel and immigration from seven-majority Muslim countries which also halted refugee resettlement. He said that refugeesʉare not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people.۝ Here I am calling for a ban where I am not letting anybody in and we take 2,000 people. Really it looks like 2,000 people that Australia does not want and I do not blame you by the way, but the United States has become like a dumping ground.۝ After Turnbull implored him to honor the agreement, Trump again expressed exasperation. OK, this shows me to be a dope,۝ he said. If I have to do it, I will do it, but I do not like this at all.۝ He said the Boston Marathon bombers were from wherever they were.۪ Can Australia give me a guarantee that if we have any problems  you know that is what they said about the Boston bombers . They said they were wonderful young men,۝ Trump said to Turnbull. They were Russians. They were not from any of these countries,۝ Turnbull responded, referring to Trump۪s travel ban. Trump said, They were from wherever they were.۝"

Trump۪s history with Vietnam is similar to Blumenthal۪s. The senator obtained at least five deferments from military service between 1965 and 1970, according to The New York Times . Trump also deferred the draft five times ۥ four times for education and once after he was diagnosed as having bone spurs in his heels.

Trump۪s latest attack on Blumenthal came after the senator appeared on CNN Monday morning, arguing that the investigation into Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election must be pursued۝ and that special counsel Robert Mueller must be protected throughout the process. Blumenthal responded to Trump۪s bullying۝ with tweets of his own, telling the president that this issue isn۪t about me.۝ Trump has attacked Blumenthal several times in the past. He tweeted against the senator in February after Blumenthal said then-Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch found Trump۪s attacks on judges disheartening۝ and demoralizing.۝ In May, Blumenthal argued a special prosecutor was needed to investigate the Trump campaign۪s ties to Russia after the president fired FBI Director James Comey. Trump, tweeting again , called Blumenthal one of the greatest military frauds in U.S. history.۝ The Monday morning posts were part of a larger tweetstorm that also included a rant against fake news.۝ Trump tweeted about Blumenthal again Monday afternoon. Blumenthal, in another CNN appearance after the latest Trump tweet, declined to directly respond to the president۪s comments. He repeatedly told CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer that he would rather focus on protecting the independence and integrity۝ of Mueller۪s investigation. It is not about me,۝ Blumenthal said. I have no idea what is in [Trump۪s] mind. What I do know is I will not be distracted by this bullying. These bullying tweets reinforce for me the need for a piece of legislation ... to prevent the firing of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, whom he has also sought to intimidate.۝ This article has been updated with Blumenthal۪s response to the latest Trump tweet attacking him."

The district encompasses part of the city of Norman, home of the University of Oklahoma. Rosecrants had lost by a nearly identical margin in a previous race for the seat in November. The seat opened up, however, when Republican Scott Martin resigned to head the Norman Chamber of Commerce, prompting Tuesday۪s special election. The Democratic win was even more notable because President Donald Trump defeated Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in the legislative district by over 10 percentage points . Rosecrants campaigned on restoring school funding, reforming the state۪s criminal justice system, resolving Oklahoma۪s budget crisis and limiting corporate influence on state politics. Representative-elect Rosecrants fought hard to win this open Republican seat that Trump carried by 10 points in 2016.

For every Colin Powel l and Hillary Clinton , there are 10 Ann Venemans and Anthony Foxxes . If an official does gain wider name recognition, it۪s usually someone in a higher position like the attorney general or secretary of state. Under President Donald Trump , however, something different is happening: Everyone hates the education secretary, the person who is 16th in line to the presidency and controls only 3 percent of the federal budget. Lawmakers and activists say they۪ve heard more about Betsy DeVos than any other Cabinet secretary ever ۥ often from people who aren۪t usually politically engaged. All the time,۝ said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). This is true in town halls, when I۪m walking down the sidewalk in my neighborhood, when I go into the grocery store. People come up to me to talk about Betsy DeVos. There۪s just no comparison. I۪ve never had this happen with any other Cabinet secretary.۝ There is no one in America more unpopular than Betsy DeVos,۝said Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.). To have somebody who scorns public education, who never went to a public school, her children never went to a public school... to be in charge of public education is an outrage.۝ A HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted Oct. 9-10 found that, indeed, DeVos is Trump۪s most unpopular Cabinet official, alongside Jeff Sessions, the much more visible attorney general.DeVos and Sessions both have a 42 percent unfavorability rating in that poll. When asked which Cabinet members are doing a bad job,۝ 32 percent of respondents picked Sessions and 32 percent picked DeVos. Thirty-seven percent of respondents said DeVos is doing a worse job than her predecessors, with just 20 percent saying she۪s doing better and 12 percent saying she۪s doing about the same. A recent Morning Consult/Politico poll had similar results: DeVos was Trump۪s most unpopular Cabinet secretary, with a net favorability rating of -12 percent, followed by Sessions, who was at -4 percent. And in June, New York Times columnist Gail Collins conducted a reader poll for worst Trump Cabinet member . DeVos won. DeVos is now a household name for many Democrats ۥ so much so that she has essentially become a new boogeyman for 2018. Democratic candidates nationwide are mentioning her in their fundraising emails. A Democratic operative who works on Senate races said that emails and communications about DeVos tend to perform very strongly.۝ Democratic groups certainly mounted a determined campaign against DeVos۪ confirmation, and they continue to hammer her today. But they did that for a number of nominees, most of whom didn۪t become as despised as the education secretary. What۪s so different about DeVos? In the Trump Cabinet, it turns out, you can more or less get away with being a plutocrat, a dilettante or a saboteur hostile to the very mission of the agency you mean to lead. You just can۪t get away with being all three at once. The Department of Education did not respond to HuffPost۪s requests for comment. A Disastrous Confirmation Hearing Spend any time talking to people about DeVos, and what you۪ll hear over and over is that she has no experience in public education. She never went to public school, never sent her kids to public school and never worked in a public school. (She did volunteer in one , however.) What DeVos had was political connections, thanks to her family۪s fortune. She۪s a billionaire, the daughter-in-law of the co-founder of Amway, the multilevel marketing corporation. She۪s long been active in the Michigan Republican Party and is a major donor. My family is the biggest contributor of soft money to the Republican National Committee,۝ she wrote in Roll Call in 1997. I have decided to stop taking offense at the suggestion that we are buying influence. Now I simply concede the point. They are right. We do expect something in return. We expect to foster a conservative governing philosophy consisting of limited government and respect for traditional American virtues. We expect a return on our investment .۝ DeVos۪ driving cause has been school choice.۝ In Michigan, she led the push to use public dollars to pay for private school tuition through vouchers and other means. That experiment has been a success for banks and hedge funds, and a resounding failure for many students. A 2016 report by the Education Trust-Midwest, a nonprofit, concluded that under the model shaped by DeVos, Michigan۪s K-12 system is among the weakest in the country and getting worse. In little more than a decade, Michigan has gone from being a fairly average state in elementary reading and math achievement to the bottom 10 states. It۪s a devastating fall.۝ DeVos wasn۪t an education expert. She was, as The Washington Post pointed out, essentially a lobbyist who used her money to push an agenda that didn۪t have much evidence of success to back it up. Her defenders, however, say she is a passionate advocate of returning control of education to parents, so that they can decide how their money is used. She has used her money to commit herself to education, these defenders say, and she۪s dedicated to helping children. Democrats and education experts in certain circles knew about DeVos before Trump nominated her for education secretary. But she wasn۪t widely recognizable ۥ until her confirmation hearing, that is. DeVos۪performance at her January hearing may have been one of the worst ever for a Cabinet nominee. She didn۪t know about a key federal law that protects students with disabilities . She tried to argue that guns may be acceptable in schools,saying a school out West, for example, might need to protect against grizzly bears . She confused two different ways to measure student achievement  by proficiency or by growth  even though they۪re hot topics of debate in education circles. And she refused to commit to enforcing federal regulations meant to protect student borrowers from programs that leave them buried in debt with few employable skills. She seemed to know very little about public education,۝ said Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), who was a member of the committee that questioned DeVos. And of course, her office is one where someone should know an incredible amount about public education.۝ DeVos۪ disastrous performance translated to internet gold for the activists opposing her. Clips of DeVos struggling to answer questions from Democratic senators quickly went viral. To be honest, she just did all the work for us at the hearing,۝ said one Democratic congressional staffer who requested anonymity to speak openly. She was so good at explaining how unqualified she was for the job.۝ Franken was the one who questioned DeVos about the difference between the proficiency۝ and growth۝ approaches to measuring student achievement ۥ a difference that DeVos eventually admitted she didn۪t know about. In the aftermath of her hearing, I did hear a tremendous amount about my questioning of her and the whole hearing in general,۝ Franken said. About a week after the hearing, Franken was out to dinner with former Vice President Walter Mondale at a restaurant in Minneapolis. Mondale took the senator to the back of the restaurant to meet the staff. There was a guy who was carrying plates to wash, and he just said to me, Thanks for your questions to DeVos. Please vote against her,۪۝ Franken said. This wasn۪t someone who was a member of the teachers۪ union, at least as far as I can tell. He was working in the kitchen. That happened a lot. It was people from all walks of life who were just taken with how bad that hearing was.۝ Josh Nelson is deputy political director at the progressive activist group Credo, which mobilized against DeVos۪ nomination. His group has done thousands of petitions over the past decade, but they۪ve never seen anything like the response to DeVos. CREDO has fought to block the confirmation of more than a dozen Trump nominees and the campaign opposing Betsy DeVos resonated with our members more than any of the others,۝ Nelson said in an email. Our petition generated 1,500,000 signatures ۥ far more than any other petition we have ever run... We believe it was the largest petition opposing a cabinet nominee in U.S. history.۝ Their members also made more than 100,000 phone calls to Senate offices, working closely with unions ۥ the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association ۥ and other progressive groups. NEA said that in just one month, it sent more than 1.2 million emails and made more than 40,000 phone calls concerning DeVos۪ confirmation. Parents and teachers are highly networked. They organize school concerts, field trips, bake sales and all sorts of other events on a daily basis. As it turns out, they can also organize opposition to a Cabinet secretary. We۪ve never had an outpouring like that,۝ said NEA President Lily Eskelsen Garcia. And by the way, those weren۪t all our members.۝ NEA members posted messages to Facebook urging others to oppose DeVos, Eskelsen Garcia said, and then they called their friends and neighbors, they organized their church groups. They got a lot of parents and community folks to make those phone calls too.۝ Some people have wondered whether DeVos has taken extra heat because she۪s a woman ۥ one of just two in Trump۪s Cabinet. Meghan McCain, author and daughter of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), said she found the backlash to DeVos  a little sexist .۝ Thurston Domina, an associate professor of education policy at the University of North Carolina, told NPR that DeVos is no more clueless or ideologically awful than some other appointees, but we have a cultural role for a man who۪s sort of a cowboy and comes in.۝ Because of this double standard, Domina said, DeVos comes off looking like a lady who lunches.۝ Eskelsen Garcia, the first female president of the NEA in 25 years, rejected the idea that DeVos is facing greater opposition because of her gender. Betsy DeVos is unpopular because of her policies,۝ she said. Any attempt to make her somehow the victim of some kind of discrimination herself is absolutely not supported by anything I۪ve ever seen.۝ DeVos isn۪t the first female education secretary ۥ that was Shirley Hufstedler, who held that position during the Carter administration. Most recently, Margaret Spellings served as education secretary from 2005 to 2009. Over the years, AFT has clashed with plenty of government officials ۥ including those in Democratic administrations. But there was a key difference, said Randi Weingarten, the union۪s president: There was always a common ground... about public education. They didn۪t actively try to kill what is foundational to democracy.۝ Republicans Speak Out Against DeVos DeVos, of course, did end up getting confirmed. But the circumstances were embarrassing: Vice President Mike Pence had to break the tie, giving her the smallest margin of confirmation ever. Pence had to cast a vote in his role as president of the Senate because two Republican senators ۥ Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska ۥ decided to join with a united Democratic caucus in opposing DeVos۪ confirmation. In a speech announcing her opposition, Collins expressed her surprise at DeVos۪ unfamiliarity with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which had flummoxed the nominee during her hearing. Ultimately,Collins said, an education secretary needs to support strengthening public education. The mission of the Department of Education is broad, but supporting public education is at its core,۝she said. I am concerned that Mrs. DeVos۪ lack of experience with public schools will make it difficult for her to fully understand, identify, and assist with those challenges, particularly for our rural schools in states like Maine.۝ Murkowski, like Collins, is from a rural state and said she was concerned that DeVos wasn۪t fully committed to helping students who are not able to access an alternative choice in education as in so many of my communities.۝ Also key to Murkowski۪s opposition, she said, was the outpouring of disapproval from Alaskans. I have heard from thousands ۥ truly thousands of Alaskans who have shared their concerns about Mrs. DeVos as secretary of education,۝ she said in a speech on the Senate floor. They۪ve contacted me by phone, by email, in person. Their concerns center, as mine do, on Mrs. DeVos۪ lack of experience with public education and the lack of knowledge she portrayed at her confirmation hearing.۝ Alyse Galvin, a founding member of Great Alaska Schools, was a major spearhead of that opposition, which targeted both of the state۪s senators. She and other education advocates in Alaska organized a Betsy DeVos Tie-Breaker Telethon۝ on Facebook Live, urging people to call them and give their thoughts about DeVos. They then displayed the results and noted where they were coming from. It was a really obvious visual reminder to people about where Alaskans stood with DeVos,۝ Galvin said. The top reason people said they opposed DeVos was because of her lack of experience in public education. Every teacher ۥ and I would say a lot of parents ۥ know the name Betsy DeVos,۪۝ Galvin said. And I would say most people in the nation, up until this year, have never known who their education secretary is... We۪ve trusted that it۪s going to work. When word got around that this person has never even set foot really as an educator in public education, there was no doubt that people were going to start paying attention.۝ Republicans who oppose DeVos say it۪s not against the party۪s philosophy to support public education. Indeed, the vast majority of Americans send their children to public schools, and for the most part, people are happy with their local schools . Ginny Evans is a high school teacher in a Dallas suburb and a member of the NEA. She voted for Trump. School choice is, to me... whether I۪m going to have my child go to [public] school in Plano or go to school in Lewisville,۝ she said. It۪s not charter schools. I۪m going to keep our dollars in public education. And there is no way our most vulnerable ۥ our special education kids ۥ there is no way they can even get the quality education that they deserve in a charter school. There۪s not enough there.۝ David Kinsella is a high school teacher in Prince William County, Virginia, who identifies as a moderate Republican (he didn۪t vote for Trump). He, too,is a member of the NEA,and he said he doesn۪t like that DeVos seems more interested in helping the charter school industry۝ than helping public schools and the students who attend them. He noted that in many places, like Virginia, there isn۪t much demand for charter schools. A genuinely conservative approach, he said, would be to respect those choices rather than pushing charter schools on communities. We۪ve always had a history of supporting public schools,۝ he said. I don۪t know why suddenly we all have to change because Betsy DeVos arrives on the scene. All Republicans [aren۪t] going to change their philosophy and say, OK! Out with public schools. Let۪s bring in the private charter schools and let۪s help that industry and help them get ahead.۪۝ Pushing Forward In Office DeVos may be in office, but the opposition to her hasn۪t stopped. Just days after her confirmation in early February, she decided to visit a middle school in Washington, D.C. She encountered protesters, who shouted Shame!۝ and forced her to retreat to her car with her security detail. I respect peaceful protest and I will not be deterred in executing the vital mission of the Department of Education,۝DeVos later said. No school door in America will be blocked from those seeking to help our nation۪s schoolchildren.۝ Since then, DeVos has consistently faced protests. One of the most notable protests occurred in May at Bethune-Cookman University, a historically black college in Daytona Beach, Florida. Students booed DeVos, who was giving a commencement address, and about half of the graduating students turned their backs on her . Dominik Whitehead, a BCU graduate, was the lead organizer. He decided to do something about DeVos۪ appearance at his alma mater after hearing that she had co-opted HBCUs for her own agenda, saying historically black schools were pioneers of ۝ school choice .۝ In reality, HBCUs were a response to Jim Crow laws that barred African-Americans from attending white schools. In other words, they didn۪t really have much choice. Ultimately Whitehead organized more than 60,000 people to sign online petitions objecting to DeVos۪ speech. DeVos has aggressively pushed her agenda since taking office, even though she had little support for her confirmation. You۪d think that someone who came in in that manner would tiptoe carefully and adopt a listening posture and move with some humility,۝ said the congressional staffer. We just haven۪t seen that. She۪s been gangbusters on a lot of things, particularly on our rolling back all sets of protections for students.۝ After reportedly putting up an initial resistance, DeVos went along with the Trump administration۪s decision to rescind protections for transgender students that allowed them to use the restroom that best corresponded to their gender identity. DeVos rescinded Obama administration rules on how colleges should handle sexual assault, leaving advocates worried that the move could help shield those who have been accused . She withdrew consumer protections for student loan borrowers and reinstated heavy fees for some borrowers who default. And in April, DeVos hired a woman to head the Office for Civil Rights who once claimed she۪d experienced discrimination in college for being white . What she۪s been effective in is creating a platform for herself and for her colleagues that now, people have to fight against,۝ Weingarten said. So instead of taking the tremendous energy and aspiration and the hope and glow in the aftermath of changing No Child Left Behind and rolling up our sleeves to focus on teaching and learning, we۪re back in the school wars. How is that fair to kids?۝ It۪s breathtaking,۝ Warren said. She doesn۪t even pretend that she۪s working for students... She has filled the room with for-profit college hacks and has clearly picked their side over and over. She۪s been very effective at rolling back rules that were in place to try to get some accountability with the for-profit colleges.۝ The fight has continued to energize activists and union members. We have never seen more energy than we۪re seeing right now,۝ Eskelsen Garcia said. We have actually had our phones ringing off the hooks. The increased activism of our members and parents and community leaders saying, Put me in, Coach. What can I do to fight this horrible agenda of this secretary of education?۪ We۪ve never seen anyone in charge of public education and protecting students be so remiss in their job.۝ It۪s awoken an activism by a lot of people who weren۪t active before,۝ Weingarten said. Warren has kept an eye on DeVos with a project called DeVos Watch . The oversight campaign focuses on how DeVos۪ work affects student loan borrowers. Over the summer, Warren had a victory when she teamed up with Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) to stop the Department of Education from giving management of the entire $1.2 trillion federal student loan portfolio to just one company, rather than the nine companies that currently manage it. You۪d have a completely non-competitive market for the student loan serving and a too-big-to-fail company, making, I should say, hundreds of millions of dollars,۝ Warren said. This is big money. And she just announced that this is how she۪s going to do it.۝ DeVos backed off from her plan after Blunt and Warren introduced their legislation. Change is possible. I۪ve seen it. I۪ve seen it even with Betsy DeVos,۝ Warren said. But you don۪t get what you don۪t fight for. And that۪s why it۪s important to be in these fights.۝ DeVos is still moving forward where she can. Last week, she rescinded 72 documents that were intended to provide clarity about students۪ rights and how schools can use federal money. The Education Department determined the documents were unnecessary. One of the key federal laws they provided guidance on? T he Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ۥ which DeVos hadn۪t heard of at her hearing just a few months ago. Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed reporting. Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-remove-pence_us_599465e1e4b009141641dce9","WASHINGTON ۥ For those who watched President Donald Trump۪s tirade in Phoenix Tuesday night and his angry news conference in New York a week earlier, and then recall his Twitter threats about nuclear weapons earlier this month, there is some good news: A president can be removed from office if his Cabinet deems him mentally unstable. There is also bad news: The only person who can start that process, Vice President Mike Pence , has been loath to utter even a negative word about his boss. And then there۪s the worst news: Even a process that would effectively take the nuclear launch codes away from Trump far faster than impeachment ever could still may not be fast enough. Terrifying, when you stop and think about it,۝ said John Hudak , a senior fellow who studies presidential powers at the Brookings Institution . The ability of the president to order a nuclear attack is almost certainly faster than the ability to assemble the Cabinet and poll it.۝ Trump۪s recent behavior, culminating in the unrestrained, 77-minute rally in Phoenix, has some commentators wondering whether Trump is fit to serve as president.ʉI found this downright scary and disturbing ,۝ former intelligence chief James Clapper said on CNN of the rally. I worry about frankly the access to nuclear codes. In a fit of pique, if he decides to do something about [North Korean dictator] Kim Jong Un, there۪s actually very little to stop him.۝ Trump۪s statements on North Korea in recent weeks are unprecedented from an American president since the dawn of the nuclear age seven decades ago. But the White House and its defenders paint them as deliberately tough to send a strong message to Kim . They say the more temperate remarks from Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson are part of a carefully thought-out strategy. Others worry that the reality is exactly as it seems:A president incapable of managing his temper is lashing out recklessly on something that could bring global catastrophe. I think we۪re so at risk right now. So at risk,۝ said Rick Wilson, a Florida Republican political consultant with a background in defense intelligence. It۪s pretty obvious that everyone around him knows that he۪s crazy. His team knows that he۪s not mentally stable.۝ Nuclear Crisis Fades, But Threat Remains The potential problem arises from Trump۪s personality colliding with a nuclear strategy based on having rational actors on both sides. Even at the height of the Cold War , the mutually assured destruction۝ theory assumed that leaders of the Soviet Union and the U.S. would not risk their countries۪ very existence for the possibility of some relatively minor geopolitical gain. Congress in the 1950s ceded its war-making authority when it came to nuclear weapons on the argument that it was impossible to insert a legislative body into the decision-making process when missiles launched from Russia could hit the United States in a mere 30 minutes. That time constraint, in fact, gave us the system still in use now, in which the president can, by himself, order the use of nuclear weapons using codes that are carried by a military aide in his immediate presence at all times. These coded orders are transmitted to a war room in the Pentagon, where the officer on duty relays them to the appropriate missile silos, bombers and submarines. The entire process was designed to take only a few minutes, on the idea that deterrence was increased if the Soviets knew that a retaliatory strike would be underway before their first warheads even landed. That game theory starts to break down, though, when one of the participants does not behave rationally, and it falls apart completely when both do not. When you have two irrational actors, it۪s kind of scary,۝ Wilson said. Earlier this month, following North Korea۪s test of a long range intercontinental ballistic missile able to hit most U.S. cities and a report that its military was capable of making nuclear bombs small enough to fit on them, Trump stated via Twitter ,ʉMy first order as President was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before.۝ Kim responded by threatening to fire missiles all around the Western Pacific island of Guam, an unincorporated United States territory and home to American Air Force and Navy bases. And Trump responded to that by tweeting, Military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely. Hopefully Kim Jong Un will find another path!۝ In reality, there was no out-of-the-ordinary military activation. Shore leaves were not canceled. Neither military families nor State Department staff in South Korea were sent home. Tillerson defended Trump۪s statements as something Kim would readily understand, but emphasized that Americans should sleep soundly and that efforts to resolve the situation diplomatically were continuing. Mattis also used harsh language but ۥ unlike his boss ۥ made clear that the threatened actions would take place only if Kim acted aggressively. The crisis appears to have faded thanks, in part, to the fallout from a violent white nationalist protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, and Trump۪s response to it. However, the president۪s critics continue to worry that Trump could still be goaded into actually using nuclear weapons against Kim ۥ with little recourse to stop him. There is nothing unlawful about the president using nukes,۝ said the Brookings Institution۪s Hudak. Ultimately he is the commander in chief and they can۪t say no to him.۝ Invoking The 25th Amendment The one legal way to block Trump would involve Pence invoking the 25 th Amendment , which was ratified in response to President John F. Kennedy۪s 1963 assassination. When William Henry Harrison died just one month after his 1841 inauguration, Vice President John Tyler assumed the presidency ۥ even though the Constitution did not specifically state that this should happen. Tyler۪s actions set the precedent for every in-office presidential death since, and the 25 th Amendment codified the process. The amendment, though, also addressed a president who became incapacitated ۥ the way Woodrow Wilson did in 1919 after suffering a stroke. His wife and doctor covered up his condition, essentially leaving the country without a president until Wilson۪s partial recovery in 1920. The new amendment spelled out that the vice president should take on presidential duties, should something similar happen again. Under drafters۪ language, the vice president starts this process by taking the question to the Cabinet, a majority of whom would have to concur for the transfer of power to happen. The president could rescind that by declaring that no inability exists.۝ Should the vice president and Cabinet agree a second time that the president is, in fact, unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office,۝ the question is thrown to Congress, which would have three weeks to vote by two-third majorities to replace the president. During that interim period, the vice president would remain in power ۥ meaning, if it were to happen with Trump over nuclear weapons, Pence would presumably have some time to defuse the situation. It would be a last resort option, the vice president essentially overthrowing the president,۝ Hudak said. One big question is whether, in a crisis atmosphere, Pence would be able to pull it off. It would take just minutes for Trump to access the codes carried in the satchel nicknamed the  nuclear football ,۝ whereas lining up votes of Cabinet members would almost certainly take longer. On paper, Trump could move faster than they could,۝ said Bruce Blair, who served as an Air Force launch silo commander in the 1970s and now studies nuclear weapons decision-making at Princeton University. But Blair noted that the amendment does not specify how the votes had to be gathered. If they were desperate enough, I would think they۪d find a way to move the papers around and the phone calls around_ If they came to believe that the man might order the use of nuclear weapons in a rash and reckless way, they might move very quickly to preempt him,۝ he said. It would be fairly ad hoc.۝ The fundamental question, of course, is whether Pence would take such a step. Pence۪s office did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment on that point, and the vice president has since the day Trump put him on the ticket last year always defended his boss. How Pence might react if nuclear war was a possible consequence is speculative, though some Republicans believe he would take action. One House member who was close to Pence during his tenure there said the vice president would likely not act on his own ۥ unless Mattis and [National Security Adviser H.R.] McMaster give that advice,۝ the member said on condition of anonymity. A political consultant close to the Trump White House, also speaking on condition of anonymity so he could speak freely about the president, agreed. Gen. Kelly will sound an alarm if he needs to,۝ the consultant said, referring to new chief of staff John Kelly, a retired Marine general. The consultant did not think Trump would be reckless, but said critics should find some peace of mind in the presence of Kelly, McMaster and Mattis: You should take heart that the president has surrounded himself with generals,۝ the consultant said.

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-obama-italy_us_5957029ce4b02734df3285bc","GIARDINI NAXOS, Italy ۥIt was the cab driver۪s last trip of the evening, close to midnight, running me from the G-7 summit press filing center to my hotel a few miles away, and as he sped down the deserted streets we made small talk about that day۪s meetings. He was an older guy, driving an older minivan, whose English was even more limited than my Italian. I said the day۪s meetings had gone fine when, placing my accent, he asked me how Signor Trump was doing. I almost answered automatically  he was fine  when on a lark I told him that I۪d written a story saying people thought he was molto pazzo۝  very crazy. That many Italians were saying this. Which was when he raised a hand: No. No. Signor Trump non ̬ molto pazzo. Signor Trump ̬ tutto pazzo.۝ Over the next few minutes I was able to discern some of his other views on Signor Trump. That he was an old man but acted like a bambino.۝ That there was something not right with his testa.۝ And how did he possibly get so rich being so dumb? Hearing this wasn۪t surprising. I۪d already talked to people in Rome, Milan and Genoa, and this seemed to be the consensus view in Italy. (Indeed, a new Pew poll shows that low regard for President Donald Trump is not confined to Italy, but is pretty common around the world.) Trump۪s recent visit to Rome drew protests, but the mayor۪s refusal to grant permits kept them relatively modest. That there were protests at all was, from my viewpoint, a breathtaking reversal. As it happened, I had also been in Italy eight years earlier ۥ not as a working journalist, but on a two-year sailing sabbatical ۥ when a different American president had come into office. The contrast could not have been more stark. Barack Obama had been celebrated and cheered as a sure sign that the world was at a turning point. If a major power that had been among the last nations in the civilized world to outlaw slavery could elect as its leader someone from the race of those slaves  well, maybe the planet had some hope after all. As unpopular as Trump is now in the world, Obama was beloved eight years ago. His visit to Berlin۪s Tiergarten Park in 2008 drew a crowd of 200,000  before he had even been elected. Throngs of well-wishers lined the streets of Rome to cheer his motorcade during a 2009 Vatican visit. He had not been in office a full year before the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded him the Peace Prize  not for actual peace he had achieved in those first months, but for the prospect of peace he offered. The fact that Obama was not able to completely end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, or even close the United States۪ prison for accused terrorists at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, certainly led to a letdown for many of his European fans. Personally, I was very disappointed,۝ said Alice Salvatore, a 35-year-old member of the Ligurian regional parliament. I saw in him something new, as someone who could change politics all over the world.۝ It۪s striking that Salvatore, despite her youth, belongs to the Five Star Movement political party that wants to pull Italy out of the European Union, turn to protectionist trade policies, and cut back on the number of refugees entering the country. A populism born of a deep-rooted pessimism  the same sort of pessimism that helped Trump win the presidency  has displaced the optimism that had seemed so inevitably ascendant just eight years ago. Goodbye, hope and change. Hello, God help us all. Thumbs-Up And Obama T-Shirts Sure, Obama was a popular president at home in 2009  with approval ratings about as high as any president nowadays is likely to see, in the low 60s. That was nothing compared to what people in other countries thought of him. Everywhere we sailed, the sight of the Stars and Stripes flying from our stern brought a smile. People greeted us, asked where we were from, and told us how much they loved our president. Some would ask if I had met him (perchance, I had, early in his primary campaign  a fact that afforded me bonus points). One time, as we lay at anchor, a couple actually swam over to our Alden 44 cutter, Juno, pointed at the flag and gave us a thumbs-up. President Obama!۝ they shouted. This was more than a little startling to us. For years during the George W. Bush presidency, cities across Europe saw enormous protest marches against him. I had worried that we would face some resentment in our travels  that we might personally be asked to answer for the Iraq War. The election of Obama apparently washed away our sins in their eyes, at least for a time. Bermuda, the Azores, Spain, Italy, Greece, and then most notably in the predominantly black countries in the Caribbean  we met Obama fans in them all. Even in Brava, a tiny volcanic island in the Cape Verde archipelago, we saw a street vendor selling President Barack Obama T-shirts. Perhaps this was to be expected in port towns that see a lot of yacht traffic. These places tend to be somewhat cosmopolitan. More surprising was people۪s interest in Sibari, a tiny town up in the northwest corner of the arch۝ in Italy۪s boot, where we spent the first winter of the trip. Southern Italy generally is rural and poor. Sibari was both of those things, but also isolated. Yet even there, we were peppered with questions about our president. From the marina office manager, from the waiters at the local pizzeria, from one of the boatyard workers. Even Francesco, the taxi driver we would call when we needed a ride from the marina to the train station. (It never occurred to me to ask his last name. We got his number from the marina office  but for all I know, he might have been the only taxi driver in Sibari.) On one of our first trips into the stazione in the center of the village, we got talking about Obama. He loved him, he said, and thought it was great that he had won. He did allow that a lot of people in southern Italy didn۪t like him perche ̬ nero۝  because he is black. My Italian wasn۪t yet good enough to respond that that was the reason a lot of people in the southern United States didn۪t like him, either. In any event, the sense of the place that stuck in my mind was optimism. Things were good, and were on their way to getting even better. Eight years later, it seemed a different place entirely. The Good Old Days, Maybe Not If the change in outlook from the Obama years to now could be embodied in a single face, it might be that of Loredana Botarelli. As a young woman, she began a career in re-insurance, the business of providing insurance to insurance companies. Over the years she worked in Rome, Milan and London as she moved up the ladder. In 2009, after 27 years with Swiss Re, the company closed most of its field offices during the financial crisis and she was laid of. Botarelli took stock of her life and the only world she had known, and concluded that what she had wasn۪t coming back. I decided to just change my life completely,۝ she said. Now in her mid-50s, Botarelli instead runs the Ivory Moda Uomi, a clothing store not far from Roman landmarks like Altare della Patria and the Trevi Fountain, where she spends her days among racks of men۪s suits. The hours are long, the income not close to what she had been making. If this sounds similar to the stories of former Rust Belt factory workers holding multiple jobs and still not making what they used to  well, the resulting politics are similar as well. Botarelli was a supporter of longtime, off-and-on Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, saying he improved the lives of all Italians. Not surprisingly, she supports Trump, too. Trump is the best,۝ she beamed. He is a good manager. Like Berlusconi. We had a lot of progress for everybody.۝ A woman who spent nearly three decades working for a company built on the idea of international finance and trade is now, because of personal circumstances, on the opposite side of those same issues. Everything-Is-Terrible-ism And A Not-So-Bad World Things were better back in the day, back before ... At the core of it, that۪s the idea shared by Berlusconi and Five Star supporters in Italy, and Trump supporters in the United States. That before political correctness,۝ or the introduction of the Euro, or so many illegals۝ snuck across the border, or all those refugees were brought in  before any of that stuff, things were not just good, but maybe the best they had ever been. Of course, it۪s objectively not true. Italy was a poorer nation prior to the introduction of the common currency than it is today, and was far, far poorer in the post-World War II years. The United States may have been an easier place to succeed for white men with only a high school degree in the 1950s and ۪60s, but it was a less hospitable place for everybody else. Indeed, when looking at the world as a whole, there has never been a time in human history when the future has been as bright and full of potential as it is right now. A smaller percentage of the world۪s population is dying in childhood, or living in abject poverty, or perishing in a war than ever before. A greater percentage of girls and women are receiving educations around the globe than at any time previously. Astonishingly rapid advances in solar technology mean that the world is on the cusp of a limitless and nearly pollution-free source of power. More broadly, fewer people are working fewer hours to produce life۪s necessities. Yet there remains a foreboding among so many, an everything-is-terrible-ism۝ that seems intractable. This is not completely surprising. Change is hard  and can be a politically useful tool for those claiming they can stop it. There are today more than twice as many jobs in the solar industry than in coal , yet Republicans (including Trump) have been able to use the decline of coal mining as a campaign theme for years. More fundamentally, workers not just in the United States, but the world over worry about losing their livelihoods not to cheaper workers in a poorer country, but to machines. So prevalent is this fear that the imperative of preserving jobs is competing against the promise of letting machines do most of the repetitive and thankless jobs that humans have been complaining about since jobs were first invented. There are, of course,significant political and economic issues that need to be resolved in the coming decades. A society where the owners of the machines make up 1 percent of the population, but reap 99 percent of the income, would be inherently unstable  a plot line of a dystopian science fiction movie. At any rate, it would seem that a distributional problem like that is a far better one to have than the constant struggle the species faced not that many generations ago, when much of the world۪s population sought to have as many children as possible as a survival tactic. Still, it۪s perhaps too much to ask people who believe their lives are getting worse to look on the bright side and remind themselves that humankind as a whole has never been richer, better fed, or more at peace than it is right now  even if it happens to be true. Salvatore, the Ligurian parliament member, said governments everywhere need to focus on their citizens, and with good jobs disappearing, to institute a universal basic income large enough that a decent life is possible for everyone. This is the sort of thing as a society that we should be pursuing, because there is no other way,۝ she said. Others, while agreeing that things could be better, don۪t believe that they۪re all that terrible. And more to the point, they don۪t believe that walling countries off from each other will help anyone. Carlo Oxoli runs his family۪s Libreria Lirus bookstore in Milan. Like Salvatore, he is 35, but has a completely different outlook on Italy۪s future. He said that pulling out of the European Union, like Salvatore۪s Five Star Movement wants, would be a disaster,۝ and that the EU should have more power and authority to bring about a cohesive Europe, not less. As to Five Star۪s leader, Beppe Grillo: He۪s a comedian. He۪s a clown.۝ What۪s more troubling for Oxoli than Italy۪s particular problems at this moment, though, is the apparent abdication of responsibility American voters have demonstrated by putting someone like Trump into power, regardless of how well or badly things were going in America. Italy is a little country,۝ Oxoli said. If we have another Silvio Berlusconi, it۪s dangerous only for us.۝"
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-changes-obamacare-trumpcare_us_5a2aecece4b069ec48ad2337","Republicans haven۪t figured out how to kill the Affordable Care Act . But they are transforming it into a weaker, less efficient and more dysfunctional version of itself. They۪ve been at it since the very first days of Donald Trump ۪s presidency, when officials in his administration canceled advertising for the final week of open enrollment for coverage at healthcare.gov. At the time, they justified it as a cost-cutting move, although the dollars were a pittance and internal research , which later became public, showed that earlier advertising had boosted enrollment. Now GOP lawmakers are on the verge of taking a more visible and potentially more consequential step. The tax cut bill Senate Republicans passed earlier this month would eliminate the individual mandate , a key piece of the program۪s architecture that requires people to get insurance or pay a penalty to the government. If final legislation includes the same provision, and if the legislation becomes law, then fewer people will have insurance and premiums will be higher, according to experts in and outside the government. The cumulative effect of Republican changes to Obamacare won۪t be tantamount to repeal. That۪s largely because of the Affordable Care Act۪s other core elements: tax credits for people buying insurance on their own, regulations on who and what insurers must cover, and special federal funding for expanded state Medicaid programs. As long as those rules are in force and as long as that money keeps flowing, the insurance system that President Barack Obama and the Democrats created in 2010 will continue to put decent, affordable coverage within the reach of millions. But the health care landscape already looks a lot different than it did when Obama left office. In many states, old problems with insurance markets have become worse, while new problems have appeared. Rules for Medicaid are changing in ways that make it harder to get on and then stay on the program. The number of people without insurance has started to creep up, and, following this year۪s open enrollment period, which ends Friday, it۪s likely to rise more significantly. If the transformation continues, it could work out just fine for some Americans. In some cases, it might even seem like an improvement. But for the country as a whole, it would almost surely mean worse access to care and more financial hardship from medical bills. After three years of progress, the country would be backsliding. How Private Insurance Is Changing The most well-publicized changes of the last year have affected private insurance for people who buy coverage on their own rather than through employers. The Affordable Care Act reorganized this troubled part of the insurance market by requiring carriers to cover people with pre-existing medical conditions ۥ and then setting standards for coverage of 10 essential۝ benefits, including mental health, maternity care and prescriptions. To make sure plans are affordable, the law introduced tax credits for anybody with an income below four times the poverty line, or $98,400 for a family of four. The law created the mandate to make sure healthy people sign up, which ensures that insurers have enough money to pay bills for their sicker customers. The transition to the new system has been difficult. When the law took effect in 2014, insurers canceled old plans (despite Obama۪s  keep your plan ۝ vow) and charged higher premiums for new ones. Consumers who qualified for little or no financial assistance felt the brunt of it. For the next few years, the majority of insurers lost money, largely because they weren۪t attracting healthy people in the numbers they۪d expected. But in states like California , where officials were fully committed to the program۪s success, the new markets have mostly worked smoothly. And by 2016, most carriers were finding their way to profitability . Although plenty of people continued to struggle with high premiums or out-of-pocket costs, millions had decent, affordable coverage they could not get before. And there were credible ideas on the table, from the likes of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton , to help the rest. Then Trump took over, unleashing a campaign of neglect and sabotage . He stopped paying a series of special payments to insurers that were the subject of a legal dispute. Insurers raised premiums in response. And that initial reduction in spending on healthcare.gov ads turned out to be a harbinger of more sweeping cutbacks ۥ not just on advertising but also on the official navigators۝ and assisters۝ that the Affordable Care Act authorizes to help sign up new customers. Those groups are now operating at lower capacity, which means they۪ll enroll fewer people. Until this year, getting people to shop for coverage was a priority for the federal government, with Obama personally promoting enrollment through venues like the comedy show  Between Two Ferns .۝ Trump, by contrast, has declared the law finished۝ and dead.۝ Seema Verma, chief administrator at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, hasn۪t issued a single tweet through her official account encouraging people to investigate their options ۥ even though, as Politico۪s Dan Diamond observed, she sent out multiple messages encouraging seniors to check out their options for Medicare next year. The people for whom advertising makes a difference tend to be the ones who don۪t think about insurance because, at least for the moment, they are healthy. That۪s a problem for insurance companies, who need those customersʉۥ and it۪s going to be an even bigger problem if the mandate goes away. Economists have historically considered the mandate essential to a well-functioning market system, and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said that, without the mandate, the number of people buying private coverage on their own would drop by 5 million and premiums for these people would rise by 10 percent as insurers adjust for a customer base more tilted toward people with serious medical problems. It۪s possible that estimate is high, and CBO may yet revise that prediction downward. As HuffPost۪s Jeffrey Young reported Saturday, not every insurer faces the same kind of market ۥ or is likely to react in the same way. But changes to the mandate are bound to interact with other changes soon to come. Any day now, the Trump administration will unveil a proposal to change the regulation of short-duration insurance plans . These are plans that don۪t typically include mental health or other essential benefits the Affordable Care Act requires, and they are almost never available to people with pre-existing conditions ۥ which means insurers can sell them for a lot less money. Once the Affordable Care Act took effect, the Obama administration decided short-term plans would not count toward satisfying the individual mandate and that, as of this year, they could last no more than three months. As with so many other decisions the Obama administration made, this was both an effort to protect people from insurance that would leave them exposed to catastrophic medical bills as well to make sure insurers selling comprehensive, regulated plans weren۪t losing healthy customers to cheaper alternatives unavailable to the sick. The Trump administration plans to alter those rules, and, although the details are not public, it۪s likely that the plans will officially be available for up to a year, as they were previously, and that they will count toward the mandate, if the mandate still exists. If healthy people can buy these plans for longer than three months and can do so without incurring a financial penalty from the mandate, many more are likely to choose that option ۥ causing insurance markets to deteriorate even more as premiums for comprehensive policies go up and more people seek out cheaper, if less secure, alternatives. How Medicaid Is Changing It۪s through the Affordable Care Act۪s expansion of Medicaid that the majority of newly insured Americans have found coverage. The expansion offered states extra money if they۪d open up the program to anybody with income below or just above the poverty line. Thirty-two states plus the District of Columbia have done that. Now that progress is in jeopardy. Republicans want to end federal funding for the expansion because, they say, Medicaid should only be for a few narrow classes of people: children, pregnant women, the elderly and people with disabilities. Republicans also want to reduce federal spending on Medicaid more generally, because they say the program costs too much. The long-term goal is to do all of this through legislation. For now, the Trump administration is making headway by using its executive authority to scale back the program, bit by bit. Federal law sketches out the basics of the Medicaid program, including who and what it must cover. But states can apply for waivers from some of these requirements and, in order to save money, they frequently seek to serve fewer people or provide them with weaker guarantees of coverage. The Obama administration tended to look upon such applications skeptically, arguing they violated Medicaid۪s federal guidelines. In March, the Trump administration announced it would look upon such applications more favorably. Already the Trump administration has approved several state requests to eliminate what۪s known as  retroactive eligibility ,۝ under which Medicaid pays the prior three months of medical bills for newly enrolled people who would have been eligible during that time. It۪s a way to reimburse the hospitals, clinics, and other health care providers who take care of people who show up without insurance. It۪s also a way to protect people who are eligible for Medicaid, but don۪t realize it until they get sick. Going forward, the Trump administration has also said it will approve state requests to impose work requirements on Medicaid. This is a big issue for Republicans who say that government-financed health insurance should be conditional upon having a job or actively looking for one. As it happens, that۪s already true for the majority of people on the program ۥ and of that small percentage who are not working or seeking work, a substantial proportion are busy caring for relatives, according to studies. But imposing work requirements reliably reduces enrollment, partly by adding one more layer to the application and qualification process, making it more difficult to get on and then stay on the program. A less obvious way the administration and its allies are scaling back Medicaid is by trying to take away the mandate, which creates an expectation that everybody should have insurance, prompting people to investigate their coverage options. Inevitably, some portion discover they are eligible for Medicaid, which is essentially free. This was very much how the Affordable Care Act۪s architects hoped the program would work. But it means more people end up on Medicaid, and that۪s not what Republicans want. Who Will Get The Blame It۪s impossible to be certain how all of these changes, taken together, would play out. But one possibility is that private insurance markets in much of the country would split into two groups, as observers like Duke University۪s David Anderson and Vox۪s Dylan Scott have sketched out in the last few weeks. Here۪s how it۪d go: As premiums go up, the tax credits would too, guaranteeing a lucrative market that at least some insurers would always want to serve. People who qualify for those credits would continue to have comprehensive coverage available at reasonable prices. And they represent the majority of people buying insurance on their own. But the tax credits aren۪t free. They come out of the federal treasury, which means that, ironically, Republican efforts could mean more federal spending to maintain the subsidized markets. More important, the people who don۪t qualify for tax credits ۥ the ones with incomes that are more than four times the poverty line ۥ would increasingly find comprehensive, regulated coverage simply unaffordable, even more so than they do today. Some would react by figuring out ways to reduce their income in order to get just below the subsidy threshold. The rest would seek out cheaper alternatives, like those short-term plans and health care ministries,۝ in which Christians share each other۪s medical bills. These options, although generally better than no coverage at all, provide less reliable protection from medical bills, as writers like Julie Appleby of Kaiser Health News and Laura Turner of BuzzFeed have detailed. For people who don۪t qualify for tax credits, the market for insurance would look a lot like it did before the Affordable Care Act took effect ۥ with coverage that works primarily for people who are in good health and stay that way. I think we could get to that point relatively quickly in some markets,۝ Sean Mullin , a senior director of the consulting firm Leavitt Partners, told HuffPost. This isn۪t 10 years off. This could be the case next year.۝ A lot would depend on where people live. States including California and Maryland where officials are most committed to expanding health insurance would probably continue doing what they do now: promote enrollment aggressively, using their regulatory powers to restrict plans that don۪t live up to the Affordable Care Act۪s standards, and maybe even creating their own versions of the individual mandate. These states would be unlikely to seek the Medicaid waivers that the Trump administration is so eager to grant. It۪d be a different story in the places where officials are seeking to limit or even undermine the Affordable Care Act۪s reach. A handful of states, such as Iowa , already have deeply damaged markets ۥ with premiums that are way too expensive for most people who don۪t qualify for subsidies ۥ and Medicaid programs that have been weakened. If Republicans continue to remake the Affordable Care Act as they have so far, more states will be in the same situation. If this comes to pass, Trump and the Republicans will surely continue to blame Obama and demand repeal. But for all of the Affordable Care Act۪s very real shortcomings, it has helped millions to get coverage and provided guarantees that Americans happen to value. If those trends reverse ۥ if more people end up struggling with access and medical bills ۥ it won۪t be on the people who created the Affordable Care Act. It۪ll be on the people running it now. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the name of the comedy show on which former President Barack Obama appeared to promote insurance enrollment. It is Between Two Ferns,۝ not Between the Ferns.۝"

Lawyers for Flynn have reportedly stopped sharing information about special counsel Robert Mueller۪s ongoing probe with the White House, a move the Times notes could signal Flynn۪s cooperation with the investigation or that he is in the process of negotiating some sort of legal deal. Flynn۪s lawyers had been cooperating with Trump۪s legal team, as defense teams often do, but recently notified the White House they could no longer discuss the investigation. Such a move isn۪t a definite sign Flynn is negotiating some sort of agreement. The Times report was based on information from four people familiar with the case, whose identities could not be revealed as they aren۪t authorized to speak publicly. Flynn resigned from the Trump۪s administration in February after it was revealed he misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States. He has long had associations with Russia and sat next to President Vladimir Putin at a dinner in Moscow in 2015. NBC News reported this month that Mueller۪s team had enough evidence to bring charges against Flynn and his son, Michael G. Flynn, who served as his father۪s chief of staff during the campaign. The elder Flynn had previously signaled that he would not cooperate with a Senate intelligence committee investigation into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in May. But the Times notes he may move to work with Mueller in an effort to save his son. His cooperation would provide insight about Trump۪s campaign and his early days in the White House. Mueller۪s probe snagged its first targets last month, when former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate, Richard Gates, were indicted on charges of conspiracy and money laundering . Both have pleaded not guilty."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gettysburg-confederate-rally-kkk-antifa_us_59592bd8e4b05c37bb7f0ca4","GETTYSBURG, Pa. ۥ A few hundred armed militia group members, Sons of Confederate Veterans, Ku Klux Klaners, supporters of President Donald Trump , and other self-described patriots descended upon the Gettysburg battlefield Saturday to defend the site۪s Confederate symbols from phantom activists with the violent far-left group Antifa. Some carried semi-automatic rifles ۥ permitted in Pennsylvania ۥ as they peered out across the battlefield with binoculars, on the lookout for the black-clad, face-masked anti-fascists, anarchists and socialists they said they had heard were traveling to the national park to dishonor Confederate graves, monuments and flags. Although many came expecting violence ۥ even after Antifa made it clear its adherents never planned to show up ۥ the only bloodshed came when a lone militia group member accidentally shot himself in the leg. In the two years since white supremacist and Confederate flag admirer Dylann Roof massacred nine black parishioners at a South Carolina church, the movement to remove Confederate symbols from public property has gained renewed purpose and momentum . So far, 60 Confederate symbols have been removed from city- and state-owned land across the U.S., according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Most recently, the city of New Orleans toppled four statues honoring the Confederacy. This has incensed and energized militia groups and white supremacists across the country, who claim Confederate symbols represent heritage and history, not hate. In May, white supremacists showed up with torches at a monument to Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, Virginia, after the city moved to take it down. Saturday۪s rally in Gettysburg showed pro-Confederate activists increasingly agitated, armed, and itching for a fight ۥ even when there is no one to clash with them. Once a storm had passed through and the sweltering July sun returned, they gathered on the battlefield here just north of the headquarters of Union Army General George Meade, whose army repelled the Confederacy in the Civil War۪s most decisive battle. After singing the National Anthem and performing the Pledge of Allegiance, the hundreds of Southern Army enthusiasts ۥ many of whom wore Trump pins, hats or T-shirts ۥ took a moment to honor the Confederate flag. I salute the Confederate flag,۝ they said in unison, with affection, reverence and undying devotion to the cause for which it stands.۝ Billy Snuffer, who identified himself as the Imperial Wizard for the Rebel Brigade of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, told HuffPost that there were KKK members scattered across the battlefield to aid law enforcement۝ and protect the area۪s 20 or so Confederate monuments from Antifa. The Confederate battle flag has nothing to do with slavery,۝ he said, standing in the same area where 154 years ago the Confederate Army marched into town, abducting free black Americans and sending them to the South to be sold into slavery. This is our history, this is our heritage,۝ the Martinsville, Virginia, resident said of the monuments. In mid-June, rumors had spread online that Antifa, a decentralized group known for violently confronting white supremacists and hate groups, planned to burn a Confederate flag and desecrate Confederate gravestones in Gettysburg on July 1, the date the three-day battle began in 1863. The rumors mobilized various far-right groups, who secured permits from the National Park Service to show up en masse to the battlefield, setting the stage for what they thought would be a dramatic showdown between the opposing fringe elements of U.S. politics. But the central Pennsylvania chapter of Antifa told local newspapers last week that it never intended to gather at Gettysburg. The rumors, the group told HuffPost in a Facebook message, were the work of online trolls. One such tale said Antifa members were going to urinate on Confederate gravestones. One problem: There aren۪t any Confederate gravestones to desecrate. Although some Confederate soldiers are buried at Gettysburg, their final resting places aren۪t marked. Still, efforts to quell the rumors didn۪t stop anti-government militia groups from across the country ۥ including West Virginia, Michigan, Nebraska and California ۥ from showing up Saturday. Our main purpose is just to defend the historical parts of the city here and stop them from being destroyed and keep people who aren۪t part of anything ... safe,۝ said a 27-year-old who would give his name only as Thor and who said he was a veteran of the war in Afghanistan. He said he was aware that Antifa likely wasn۪t going to show, but that he felt compelled to be there, just in case. Thor, a Gettysburg-area resident and member of the anti-government militia group the Three Percenters , wore an ammunition belt around a bulletproof vest. The sleeves of his camouflage uniform were rolled up, revealing the word INFIDEL۝ tattooed to his arm. Asked what he thought about all the Confederate symbols being removed from public property across the U.S., Thor didn۪t mince words. It pisses me off,۝ he said. The assembled groups۪ hatred for Antifa Saturday was surpassed only by their anger at the growing movement to remove Confederate symbols from public property. Ted Fields, a Sons of Confederate Veterans leader wearing a black leather biker vest, addressed the crowd using a megaphone and asserted that the dismantling of Confederate monuments could lead to the decimation of America itself. I believe their master plan is once they get us used to taking down some monuments here and there in some liberal cities, then they۪re gonna try it out here and see if that works,۝ he said. The next thing you know, they۪re going to take our Constitution and say you know what? That was written by slave-holders, it۪s racist, let۪s get rid of it and become a communist nation. I don۪t want that on my watch.۝ The crowd cheered. A woman named Jenny Lee, who claimed to be Robert E. Lee۪s 3rd great grandniece, implored the crowd not to be bowed by political correctness. We must never back down or be intimidated by the antics of the ignorant,۝ she said. And all the safety-pin-wearing, easily offended, butt-hurt, temper-tantrum-throwing, vagina-hat-wearing, face-covered, commie fascists can kiss my ass.۝ Lee was forceful in telling the crowd that the Confederacy ۥ and by extension, everyone gathered at the rally ۥ wasn۪t racist. The Civil War, she said, wasn۪t about slavery. ( It was .) Plus, she added to great applause, thousands of blacks fought for the South, neglecting to mention that they were forced to do so. As the rally concluded, the sound of cannons could be heard in the distance, as Civil War re-enactors not associated with the pro-Confederate rally shot off blank rounds, smoke billowing out across a different part of the battlefield. Actors in blue and gray uniforms played dead and injured. But the only person actually shot Saturday in Gettysburg with a real bullet was a 23-year-old militia group member named Benjamin Hornberger, of Shippensburg, Pennsylvania. According to U.S. Park police, Hornberger triggered his revolver when the flag pole he was carrying bumped against his gun holster. The bullet went into his leg. Police say officers quickly applied a tourniquet, likely saving his life. According to PennLive , Hornberger talked to paramedics and seemed in good spirits.۝ America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias.

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-venezuela-military_us_598e317ee4b0909642971b4f","U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday threatened military intervention in Venezuela , a surprise escalation in Washington۪s response to Venezuela ۪s political crisis. Venezuela has appeared to slide toward a more volatile stage of unrest in recent days, with anti-government forces looting weapons from a military base after the installation of an all-powerful new legislative body. The people are suffering and they are dying. We have many options for Venezuela including a possible military option if necessary,۝ Trump told reporters. More than 120 people have been killed in Venezuela and thousands arrested in over four months of unrest. The government in Caracas did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump۪s threat. Venezuela n authorities have long said U.S. officials were planning an invasion. A former military general told Reuters earlier this year that some anti-aircraft missiles had been placed along the country۪s coast for precisely that eventuality. In Washington, the Pentagon said it had not received any orders on Venezuela from the White House. Trump, asked if U.S. forces would lead any operation in Venezuela , declined to provide details. We don۪t talk about it but a military operation - a military option - is certainly something that we could pursue,۝ Trump said. The United States sanctioned Venezuela n President Nicolas Maduro and other Venezuela n officials on July 31 after Maduro established a constituent assembly run by his Socialist Party loyalists and cracked down on opposition figures. Washington has not placed sanctions on the OPEC member۪s oil industry, which supplies America with about 740,000 barrels per day of oil. Venezuela possesses a stockpile of 5,000 Russian-made MANPADS surface-to-air weapons, according to military documents reviewed by Reuters. It is the largest known cache of the weapons in Latin America and a source of concern for U.S. officials amid the country۪s mounting turmoil. The United Nations Security Council was briefed behind closed doors on Venezuela in May at the request of the United States. At the time, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said Washington was just trying to raise awareness of the situation and was not seeking any action by the 15-member Security Council.

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-debt-ceiling-speakership_us_59893fb2e4b0449ed504f52a","When Congress returns in early September, Republicans and Democrats will only have a few short weeks to raise the debt ceiling. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) faces a problem: The gap between what House conservatives want for raising the debt limit and what they can actually get is looking increasingly vast ۥ and Ryan may pay a price if he simply turns to Democrats and passes a clean raise to the government۪s borrowing authority. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told HuffPost this week that conservatives have proposed a menu of options to GOP leadership. Their ideas include adding debt prioritization language to a limit increase, which would prioritize Treasury debt payments ahead of other spending, and codifying the Trump administration۪s informal rule ۥ one regulation in, two out. Freedom Caucus Republicans are also open to making around $250 billion in mandatory spending cuts, as well as attaching a debt ceiling raise to their health care bill. But none of those options are looking all that likely, with any borrowing limit increase needing the sign-off of at least eight Senate Democrats. And with Republicans controlling Congress and the White House, there۪s little incentive for Democrats to give Republicans any concession. If anything, Democratic aides insist, it۪s Republicans who will have to give in to Democratic demands .One possible option would be to couple the debt ceiling with funds to reimburse health insurance companies serving poor customers.The Trump administration has threatened to withhold those funds, which were promised to insurance companies as part of the Affordable Care Act ,but Congress could guarantee the payments. One senior Democratic aide told HuffPost that negotiations haven۪t really begun at this point, but a lot of Democratic members are uneasy about approving more debt only to allow Republicans to cut taxes for the wealthy as a result. At this point, another senior aide said, Democrats are taking a wait and see۝ approach. Ryan۪s office said it۪s too early to comment on the negotiations or his position on the debt ceiling. But there۪s a growing sense among conservatives that Ryan۪s position is more tenuous than he anticipates, especially if he passes a clean debt ceiling raise with the help of almost every Democrat and a small coalition of Republicans. It would be extremely difficult for a Republican speaker to put forward a clean debt ceiling and look his conference in the face and believe he۪s done a job well done,۝ Meadows told HuffPost. What exactly that means is unclear ۥ Meadows wouldn۪t say more. But Republicans speaking on the condition of anonymity were more candid, with one member saying that if Ryan puts forward a clean debt ceiling raise, it becomes the start of the end for the Ryan speakership.۝ Another conservative member summed up Ryan۪s position this way: He doesn۪t get it. He۪s not going to make it to tax reform if he doesn۪t get through this.۝ If conservatives actually make the debt ceiling a litmus test for the speaker, Ryan may resist the pressure from Democrats ۥ and, potentially, the White House and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) ۥ to simply raise the limit without changes. But taking a hard stance could have serious economic implications, calling into question the United States۪ ability to pay its bills and raising interest rates for future government borrowing. In effect, playing a political game of chicken with the debt ceiling may end up costing the government, and taxpayers, more. But if you believe some Republicans, Ryan isn۪t going to cave. I would be surprised if Paul Ryan thinks we should do a clean debt ceiling increase,۝ former Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) told HuffPost. Frankly, I can۪t believe the speaker of the House is going to go along with a clean debt ceiling increase.۝ Jordan insisted that Republicans, with control of Congress and the White House, had to get some concession for raising the debt limit. The idea that we۪re going to raise the debt ceiling and not do anything structurally on the long-term debt concerns just makes no sense,۝ he said.Jordan pointed to other deals in the past to argue that Republicans had to get something. Even if it was no budget, no pay,۪۝ Jordan said, referring to a gimmicky 2013 law that placed future restrictions on congressional salaries if lawmakers didn۪t agree to a budget, Republicans always get something.۝ But part of the problem for Republicans is they۪re still negotiating with themselves. Based on conversations with conservatives this week, even if Republicans secured some small concessions, it seems unlikely they۪d get the support of every conservative. Even if they did, it still wouldn۪t be enough in the Senate. And some Republicans are just apt to vote against more debt. It doesn۪t make any difference to me whether it۪s Barack Obama or John Boehner as president and speaker of the House; my position is unchanged,۝ Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), who is running for Senate, told HuffPost. I will not vote to raise the debt ceiling unless there is a serious effort to address the underlying cause of the problem.۝ Brooks said a clean debt ceiling raise۝ was actually a dirty debt ceiling raise,۝ because lawmakers would be putting the country on a path to insolvency and bankruptcy, leading to the gutting of Medicaid, food stamps and national security. That seems like a pretty dirty thing to do to our kids and grandkids and our country,۝ Brooks said. Asked what increasing the limit without any concessions would mean for the speaker, Brooks danced around the topic, but he suggested that no reforms would be a problem for him. I like Paul Ryan personally,۝ Brooks said. I۪m gonna limit this discussion to public policy, and an increase in the debt ceiling without any substantive effort to fix America۪s deficit problem is a betrayal of America۪s future and our children and grandchildren.۝ Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) had a similar thought. It۪s not about Paul Ryan,۝ he said. It۪s about the Republican brand and fiscal responsibility. Why would we put a clean debt ceiling increase without any reforms whatsoever on a Republican president۪s desk?۝ Brat continued that he had not seen any provision in the Republican platform calling for $600 billion deficits as far as the eye can see and the bankruptcy of America on the backs of our children.۝ Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) told HuffPost that lawmakers needed some sort of Spend-aholics Anonymous, a 12-step plan, and possibly an intervention in order to end the Congress۪ propensity to spend money that we don۪t have.۝ But if Republicans can۪t get Democrats to go along with the sort of sweeping ۥ or even more limited ۥ reforms they want in exchange for raising the debt ceiling, would Republicans actually let the government default? President Donald Trump has recently settled on stock market gains as a signature achievement. The pressure to raise the debt ceiling would intensify quickly once markets start reacting to a default crisis. Already, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says Congress ought to just pass a clean bill. That message, however, has been muddled elsewhere in the administration. For one, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney ۥ himself once a fierce Freedom Caucus member who has voted against raising the debt ceiling ۥ has said he۪d like to see spending cuts or debt prioritization changes before Congress raises the borrowing limit. Trump hasn۪t weighed in himself, but it۪s easy to imagine him refusing to sign a bill that, say, continues government funding, raises the debt ceiling, excludes money for his wall along the southern border, and includes Obamacare-related funding. And with government funding running out at the end of September, around the time that Congress would have to increase the debt limit, it۪s easy to see all those issues getting rolled into one debate that Ryan, or McConnell, or Trump, or conservatives, or Democrats could derail."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-las-vegas-shooting_us_59d20d15e4b09538b5095587","Following the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, President Donald Trump on Monday offered his sympathy to the victims, but made no mention of America۪s pervasive gun violence either in his tweets or his prepared statement from the White House. At least 58 were dead and more than 500 injured after Stephen Paddock, 64, began shooting at the thousands of attendees of the Route 91 Harvest Festival from the 32nd floor of a nearby hotel in Las Vegas. When police breached his room at the Mandalay Bay hotel, they said they found Paddock dead of an apparent self-inflicted wound. He had at least 10 guns, they added. Some hours after his tweet Monday morning, Trump read prepared remarks from the White House, called the shooting an act of pure evil۝ and commended first responders and local officials. He also offered his prayers and announced that he plans to visit Las Vegas on Wednesday. Melania and I are praying for every American who has been hurt, wounded or lost the ones they loved so dearly in this terrible, terrible attack,۝ he said. We pray for the entire nation to find unity and peace, and we pray for the day when evil is banished, and the innocent are safe from hatred and from fear.۝ Not mentioned in statements from Trump and the White House: the issue of guns. When asked at Monday۪s White House press briefing whether Trump would consider gun reforms in response to the shooting, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said it was not appropriate to discuss the matter. There۪s a time and place for a political debate, but now is the time to unite as a country,۝ Sanders said, before offering her thoughts and prayers.۝ She also said it was premature to discuss policy when we don۪t know all of the facts.۝ Yet in the past, Trump has speculated on the motives for violence before any official information was confirmed. He decried the explosion at a London tube station last month as the work of a  loser terrorist ۝ and used the attack to promote his own travel ban on Muslim-majority countries. At other times, the president has been conspicuously silent in the face of atrocity. He condemned many sides۝ in the Charlottesville, Virginia, white supremacist rally in August that killed a counter-protester. Two days later, he denounced racism. But in the days that followed , he returned to blaming the white supremacists and counter-protesters equally for the violence. At Monday۪s press briefing, Sanders repeatedly dodged questions on why Trump had previously weighed in on gun violence without knowing all of the facts ۥ like in 2016, when he hastily responded to the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, by promoting his then-only-proposed travel ban. Sanders argued the situation was different because Trump was merely a presidential candidate at the time. There is a difference between being a candidate and being a president,۝ she said. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story wrongly reported that Trump didn۪t immediately respond to the Charlottesville violence. This story has been updated with Trump۪s remarks Monday morning and Sanders۪ remarks Monday afternoon."

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-impeachment-presidential-power-russia_us_5967dc92e4b0d6341fe7a783","WASHINGTON ۥ Democrats who hope that special counsel Robert Mueller ۪s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election could bring an end to Donald Trump ۪s presidency may want to consult a constitutional scholar. Congress could always impeach the president. But short of that, Trump۪s job offers him sweeping protections from the types of accountability that normally apply to regular citizens. Examples abound. Does Trump have massive conflicts of interests? Well, the president is exempt from conflict-of-interest laws. Do officials think Trump۪s son-in-law, Jared Kushner , shouldn۪t be given permanent security clearance? Well, Trump has the power to grant him clearance anyhow. Does someone want to sue Trump for his actions before he became president? Well, his lawyers say they can۪t (a questionable claim). Did Trump violate the law? Well, the sitting president is immune from prosecution. And ۥ perhaps most crucially as former FBI director Mueller investigates Donald Trump Jr. ۪s meeting with a foreign national to discuss dirt on Hillary Clinton ۥ could someone close to Trump get indicted? Well, Trump can use the power of a presidential pardon to force prosecutors to let it go. So far, there۪s been no public indication that Trump is considering preemptively pardoning his son or son-in-law, or others being investigated, including former campaign manager Paul Manafort or former national security adviser Michael Flynn. One of Trump۪s attorneys, Jay Sekulow, said Sunday that he hadn۪t had any conversations with the president about pardons. But The Washington Post reported Thursday that Trump has asked aides about how pardons work, though the report characterized the discussions as purely theoretical.۝ Although it۪s still an open question whether Trump could pardon himself , should things ever get to that point, the only thing stopping him from preemptively pardoning members of his campaign (or his family) is political backlash. And the only real restraints on the president۪s pardon power, says Saikrishna Prakash , a James Monroe distinguished professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, are political repercussions. The question of a pardon is always on the table; it۪s on the table now,۝ Prakash said. I doubt he۪s going to issue one now because people will jump to the conclusion that there۪s been a crime committed.۝ While his position as president may allow Trump to dodge legal accountability, the Russia probe has already had an effect on his political standing. That could ultimately be where the real consequences lie.A preemptive move like pardoning his son would spark massive criticism and cement the belief in many Americans۪ mind that whoever received a pardon broke the law. In a similar vein, Trump himself had proclaimed that pleading the Fifth Amendment was an admission of guilt . Although you can pardon someone you think is innocent, people will naturally suppose that the person must have done something wrong if the president pardoned them, otherwise they wouldn۪t need a pardon,۝ Prakash said. Peter M. Shane , a law professor at Ohio State University, isn۪t so sure that the normal political rules about pardons apply to Trump. After all, Trump has already admitted that the Russia investigation was on his mind when he decided to fire FBI Director James Comey. The president has repeatedly called the special counsel investigation part of a  witch hunt ۝ and has downplayed his eldest son۪s meeting with a Russian lawyer on the promise of damaging information on Democratic presidential rival Clinton, calling it  very standard .۝ In normal times, in times when we did not elect so thoroughly unqualified a president, it would have been political suicide to pardon a family member, or someone involved in an alleged conspiracy with the president himself,۝ Shane said. Nixon didn۪t pardon any of the co-conspirators in Watergate, and I think he understood to do so only would have hastened what happened anyway.۝ But Trump, seems to believe that that normal laws of politics don۪t apply to him,۝ Shane said. And he got to be president of the United States, which suggests that some of those rules did not kick in in the usual way.۝ There are still a few checks on Trump۪s power, though, Prakash said. It۪s the press, it۪s impeachment, it۪s Congress, and ultimately the populace,۝ Prakash said. It۪s a lot harder for him to do what he wants if he۪s at a 20 percent approval rating, it۪s a lot easier if he۪s got a 60 percent approval rating.۝ On Trump۪s business conflicts, there۪s not much Trump critics can do other than loudly complain, even though Trump seems impervious to۝ and unmoved۝ by the criticism, Prakash said. But criticism and public scrutiny, says Shane, would apply more pressure on Republicans to hold Trump accountable. Republican leaders need to be more afraid of the public reaction to their inaction on the issue rather than they are of losing their supporters for going after Trump, Shane added. The scrutiny on the Trump administration has already limited his range of plausible political action,۝ Shane said. A more radical move ۥ like Trump trying to get rid of Mueller or pardoning his son or son-in-law ۥ could further alter political reality. But given the way Trump has tossed aside the typical rules of politics in the past, it۪s not impossible۝ that the president would preemptively pardon Trump Jr., Shane argued. I can only tell you that the first 44 presidents would not have pardoned their children,۝ Shane said. I just don۪t know about 45.۝"
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-debt-ceiling-democrats_us_59b02a27e4b0b5e53103120b","WASHINGTON ۥ Democratic leaders found themselves in the unusual position of being on the same side as President Donald Trump on Wednesday, reaching agreement on a plan to keep the government funded and raise the debt ceiling. Trump met with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), as well as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), at the White House on Wednesday. In the meeting, the President and Congressional leadership agreed to pass aid for Harvey, an extension of the debt limit, and a continuing resolution both to December 15, all together. Both sides have every intention of avoiding default in December and look forward to working together on the many issues before us,۝ Schumer and Pelosi said in a joint statement after the meeting. Democrats had gone into the meeting hoping to get exactly this outcome.A congressional aide briefed on the meeting said Republican leaders wanted an 18-month debt ceiling hike, and then suggested six months instead. Pelosi and Schumer dismissed a six-month hike, and Trump eventually agreed to the Democrats۪ three-month proposal. Another source briefed on the meeting said Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin sided with the Republican leaders in the room in wanting a longer debt limit extension. When it was clear the congressional leaders were going to agree to disagree, Trump unexpectedly agreed to the three-month extension. Republicans often need Democratic votes to raise the debt ceiling, because many conservatives oppose increasing the government۪s borrowing limit without spending cuts to decrease the deficit. With a shorter-term debt ceiling hike coming up in December at the same time as a government funding fight, Democrats will have more leverage in the budget battle. But by siding with Democrats, Trump rejected the wishes of his own party ۥ a move that reportedly left Republicans furious ۥ and it۪s not clear how many GOP lawmakers will go along with this deal. McConnell said he would add the three-month funding and debt ceiling extension to legislation providing $7.85 billion in aid for Hurricane Harvey . The president can speak for himself, but his feeling was that we needed to come together to not create a picture of divisiveness at a time of genuine national crisis. And that was the rationale,۝ McConnell told reporters, distancing himself from the deal. Earlier Wednesday, Ryan derided Democrats۪ proposal to raise the debt ceiling for three months, calling the idea ridiculous۝ and disgraceful.۝ We۪ve got all this devastation in Texas. We۪ve got another unprecedented hurricane about to hit Florida. And they want to play politics with the debt ceiling?۝ Ryan told reporters. That will strand the aid that we need to bring to the victims of these storms that have occurred or are about to occur.۝ Mnuchin has said that he and the president wanted the debt ceiling hike to be tied to aid for Hurricane Harvey ۥ a proposal opposed by many conservatives. Congress has until Sept. 30 to reach a funding deal to avoid a government shutdown. Mnuchin said Congress needs to raise the debt ceiling by Sept. 29 , or else the United States risks default and throwing the economy into a tailspin. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) admitted that Democrats walked away with a pretty good deal. For people who want to keep score, maybe that۪s true,۝ he said when asked if Democrats received everything they wanted from Trump. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) also said she was very surprised۝ by the three-month debt limit deal. Marc Short, the White House director of legislative affairs, said Trump agreed to this deal with Democrats because to  clear the decks ۝ for tax reform. Schumer and Pelosi said they also discussed the fate of undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children and now risk deportation, thanks to an order by Trump. As Democratic leaders, we also made it clear that we strongly believe the DREAM Act must come to the floor and pass as soon as possible and we will not rest until we get this done,۝ they said. Democrats say that this new deal with Trump strengthens their hand in passing the DREAM Act, which would provide a path to citizenship for these undocumented immigrants. They۪ll be able to use the leverage they have on the debt ceiling to press for what they want legislatively, with the DREAM Act being high on the list. The congressional aide briefed on the meeting also said Ivanka Trump, the president۪s daughter, came into the Oval Office toward the end to say hello,۝ at which point the meeting went off topic. The GOP leaders were reportedly visibly annoyed by her presence there. Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One on Wednesday, Trump said he had a very good meeting۝ with Pelosi and Schumer. He did not mention any of the GOP leaders. Igor Bobic contributed reporting. Want more updates from Amanda Terkel? Sign up for her newsletter, Piping Hot Truth, here ."

Bill Cassidy (R-La.) on Tuesday night over the Republican۪s role in the revival of an Obamacare repeal bill currently making its way through the Senate . Cassidy and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) are co-sponsors of a measure that would end the Affordable Care Act , putting in its place a new coverage scheme featuring fewer rules on how insurers act ۥ and less money to help people get coverage. Those changes, combined with additional cuts to the traditional Medicaid program, would leave millions of people without insurance either because they couldn۪t afford it or because they had pre-existing medical conditions . Kimmel,who appealed to Cassidy in June to oppose a previous measure to repeal the Affordable Care Act, said the current bill fails what has been called the Jimmy Kimmel test,۝ the core tenet being: No family should be denied medical care, emergency or otherwise, because they can۪t afford it.۝ Not only did Bill Cassidy fail the Jimmy Kimmel test, he failed the Bill Cassidy test.۝ Cassidy aroused ire because of what happened in May: Kimmel tearfully told his audience his son was born with a congenital heart disease and had undergone open heart surgery that may not have been covered by insurance before Obamacare was enacted. You were born with a pre-existing condition, and if your parents didn۪t have medical insurance you might not live long enough to even get denied because of a pre-existing condition,۝ Kimmel said at the time . If your baby is going to die and it doesn۪t have to, it shouldn۪t matter how much money you make.۝ Shortly afterward, Cassidy said that principle ۥ access for all, regardless of income or medical condition ۥ should guide Republican efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. He even appeared on Kimmel۪s show. But in July, when the Senate voted on a repeal bill that clearly violated those principles, Cassidy voted yes. And now he۪s pushing a bill that would, once again,expose many more people to crippling medical bills. This guy, Bill Cassidy, just lied to my face,۝ the host said. We can۪t let him do this to our children and our senior citizens and our veterans or to any of us. I am politicizing my son۪s health problems because I have to.۝ During his program Tuesday, Kimmel pointed to the efforts of three Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, to help defeat the latest effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. I hope they have the courage and good sense to do that again with this one because these other guys who claim they want Americans to have better health care ... they۪re trying to sneak this scam of a bill they cooked up in,۝ Kimmel said of the bill that has only until Sept. 30 to pass to take advantage of parliamentary rules that allow a simple-majority vote. They don۪t even want you to see it.۝ Kimmel ended the segment with a challenge. There۪s a new Jimmy Kimmel test for you. It۪s called the lie-detector test. You۪re welcome to stop by the studio and take it anytime.۝ Kimmel acknowledged that some viewers might object to the overtly political message of his monologue. But, he said, I am politicizing my son۪s health problems because I have to.۝ Then, after listing all of the consumer, medical and health industry groups that have opposed the Graham-Cassidy bill, Kimmel posted the number for the Capitol Hill switchboard and urged his viewers to call and ask Congress to reject the legislation."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/court-trump-obamacare-sabotage_us_598128c6e4b09d24e993d470","President Donald Trump has been making noise again about halting payments to health insurance companies, which are crucial to making Obamacare work. A court decision Tuesday could disarm him. The U.S.Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled Tuesday that attorneys general from 17 states and the District of Columbia may pursue the Trump administration۪s stalled appeal of a lawsuit alleging the federal government has been making these payments illegally. The court agreed with the state officials that there۪s reason to believe the Trump administration isn۪t adequately acting on behalf of states.The Trump administration and House Republicans opposed the states۪ effort. Since before even taking office , Trump has threatened to withhold payments to health insurance companies that serve the lowest-income enrollees on the Affordable Care Act۪s exchanges. On Monday, Trump renewed this threat on Twitter in the aftermath of the Senate Republican failure to repeal the law last week. Cutting off these payments would do significant damage to the health insurance market. If they don۪t receive this money ۥ which the federal government already owes them ۥ insurers would respond by raising prices even more than they otherwise would. And some insurers would opt to abandon the Obamacare marketplaces entirely for fear of significant financial losses. That would lead to premium increases next year that would be, on average, 19 percentage points higher than if the payments continued, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. Earlier Tuesday, Covered California , the Golden State۪s health insurance exchange, reported that rate hikes would be twice as large next year if Trump refuses to make the payments. Insurers and insurance regulators in other states have warned of the same consequence. The Affordable Care Act requires health insurance companies to reduce out-of-pocket costs like deductibles and copayments for exchange customers with incomes up to 250 percent of the federal poverty level, which amounts to $30,150 for a single person. The federal government is supposed to pay insurers back from the money they lose by doing so. Almost 6 million people , or 57 percent of Obamacare enrollees, qualified for these subsidies this year, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. If Trump were to follow through on his threats to stop making the cost-sharing reduction payments , it would cost health insurance companies a huge sum: Payments this year are projected to reach $7 billion and climb to $10 billion next year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Congress could have stepped in at any time to appropriate the necessary funding, but has refused to do so , collaborating with the administration in creating uncertainty for insurers and their customers about the future of the market. The legal history leading to these payments being in jeopardy, and the states۪ attempt to intervene in the case, began in 2014. President Barack Obama requested that Congress explicitly authorize the spending required to reimburse insurers with low-income customers, but Congress denied him. The Obama administration paid out the money anyway. This prompted House Republicans , led by then-Speaker John Boehner (Ohio), to sue Obama , arguing that he repaid insurers unlawfully. A federal judge last year ruled in the House GOP۪s favor , but allowed the government to continue paying insurers while Obama۪s appeal was underway. That appeal carried over into Trump۪s presidency, making his administration the defendant in a lawsuit filed by his own party ۥ and giving him the power to unilaterally end the payments to insurance companies and send the exchanges into a tailspin . The Trump administration and House Republicans sought and received several delays from the appeals court this year, arguing in part that the repeal and replace۝ effort on Capitol Hill ۥ now stalled ۥ could make the case irrelevant. But at any time, Trump could drop the appeal or simply order the Treasury to end the payments. That, coupled with concern that the administration wouldn۪t vigorously represent the interests of states and their residents, prompted California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman in May to lead their counterparts in other jurisdictions to seek to mount their own appeal of the lower court ruling. The attorneys general from Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Washington state, and the District of Columbia joined the petition. All these attorneys general are elected Democrats, except Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin, was was appointed by Democratic Gov. David Ige. In its ruling Tuesday, the court agreed state officials had standing to join the appeal.Further court proceedings will remain on hold, the appellate judges ruled. But the involvement of the state attorneys general guarantees that at least one party to this case isn۪t simultaneously engaged in an effort to sabotage or undo the Affordable Care Act itself.

Then, on Wednesday, Trump announced he would end the council altogether , following the departure of six CEOs and leaders from the AFL-CIO. Merck & Co. CEO Ken Frazier, the only African-American on the council, was first to step down to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,۝ he said in a statement. The move drew an immediate rebuke from Trump , who claimed on Twitter that the pharmaceuticals chief would now have more time to lower ripoff drug prices.۝ Later, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank quit the group to focus my efforts on inspiring every person that they can do anything through the power of sport which promotes unity, diversity and inclusion,۝ he said in a statement. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich resigned to call attention to the serious harm our divided political climate is causing to critical issues,۝ he said in a statement. I resigned because I want to make progress, while many in Washington seem more concerned with attacking anyone who disagrees with them,۝ Krzanich added. We should honor ۥnot attackʉۥ those who have stood up for equality and other cherished American values.۝ Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, announced his resignation from the council on Tuesday. It۪s the right thing for me to do,۝ he tweeted . AFL-CIO President Trumka also announced his resignation via Twitter on Tuesday.Inge Thulin, head of 3M Co., followed on Wednesday . That same day, Campbell Soup CEO Denise Morrison reversed her previous decision to remain on the panel, citing Trump۪s Tuesday press conference. Racism and murder are unequivocally reprehensible and are not morally equivalent to anything else that happened in Charlottesville. I believe the President should have been ۥ and still needs to be ۥ unambiguous on that point,۝ she said in a statement. Following yesterday۪s remarks from the President, I cannot remain on the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative.۝ After Trump۪s initial response blaming many sides۝ for the mayhem on Saturday, bipartisan criticism forced him to condemn white supremacist groups on Monday, referring to them as criminals and thugs۝ and calling them repugnant.۝ On Tuesday, however, he defended his initial remarks. Representatives for most of the CEOs on Trump۪s manufacturing council did not immediately respond to HuffPost۪s queries about Frazier۪s resignation and whether they agreed with his statement on Saturday. Some declined to comment outright. Other CEOs on the council issued statements condemning bigotry and violence on display in Charlottesville over the weekend, while also making clear that they intended to remain on the panel. In Dow there is no room for hatred, racism, or bigotry,۝ said Dow Chemical CEO Andrew Liveris. Dow will continue to work to strengthen the social and economic fabric of the communities where it operates  including supporting policies that help create employment opportunities in manufacturing and rebuild the American workforce.۝ Campbell Soup CEO Denise Morrison denounced the racist ideology at the center of the protests۝ in Charlottesville and called on others to do the same, but added that she would stay on the council in order to have a voice and provide input on matters that will affect our industry.۝ A spokeswoman for General Electric said the company condemns the hatred and bigotry on display in at the rally in Charlottesville. However, that spokesperson added, General Electric chairman Jeff Immelt will also remain on the council because it is important for GE to participate in the discussion on how to drive growth and productivity in the U.S.۝ Lauren Lee, a spokeswoman for Dell, said there is no change in Dell engaging with the Trump administration and governments around the world to share our perspective on policy issues that affect our company, our customers and our employees.۝ Whirlpool Corp. said it believes strongly in an open and inclusive culture that respects people of all races۝ and that it would continue on the council. Under Armour۪s Plank, who has faced criticism over his past praise of Trump and who later denounced some of Trump۪s policies, initially tweeted that his company is saddened۝ by the violence in Charlottesville. There is no place for racism or discrimination in this world. We choose love & unity,۝ Plank added. Monday evening, he resigned from the group. Nucor and International Paper also denounced the violence over the weekend. They, too, said they would remain on the council. Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson, Corning CEO Wendell Weeks, and Harris Corp. CEO Bill Brown declined to comment. While Ford Motor Co. initially participated in the council, it is no longer a member. Ford does not have a representative on the manufacturing council,۝ Michael Levine, a Ford spokesman, told HuffPost. CEO Jim Hackett, who replaced Mark Fields in May, quickly distanced himself from the White House and did not rejoin the council. Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of SpaceX and Tesla, also resigned from the council earlier this year due to Trump۪s decision to leave the Paris Agreement on climate change. On Tuesday, Trump responded to the CEOs departing from the council by tweeting that he has many to take their place.۝ Here۪s a list of the president۪s remaining American Manufacturing Council members: Andrew Liveris, Dow Chemical Co.

But now, Trump is set to head out on one of his own. On Friday, he۪ll head to his New Jersey golf course for a 17-day trip, according to The Associated Press. This comes on top of the many other weekends he۪s spent either there or at his Florida resort. In fact, he۪s already outpaced Obama in time spent on the green. Trump lamented multiple times that Obama۪s trips were costing taxpayers big time. But a recent analysis by the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch found that eight years of Obama vacations cost just under $100 million. According to CNN, Trump۪s trips during his first 80 days alone have cost $20 million. I would rarely leave the White House because there۪s so much work to be done,۝ Trump said last year during his presidential campaign. I would not be a president who took vacations. I would not be a president that takes time off.۝ The president, like his predecessors, has the right to take a vacation.But the trip has put his past criticism of Obama in a new light.

But you۪re definitely surprised. You never thought the storm would get this bad. You carry on with your evening, keeping one eye out the window and the other on the news. Then your cellphone blares an alert, and you notice that the water in your backyard is a bit higher than it was before, than it۪s ever been before. Soon, water starts leaking in through the doors. You and your family rush to stop it. You grab towels, trash bags, tents, bags of cement mix  anything. You realize you should unplug anything connected to an outlet. You trip the circuit breaker. Items on the floor get moved to the countertops. You pack up important items  heirlooms, family photos, cards from loved ones  and you put essential documents in sealed plastic bags. You probably won۪t empty the fridge  the food would just spoil faster in the trash can. Then you notice water seeping into your bedroom. That۪s when it hits you  this isn۪t just an ordinary big storm.You start moving mattresses into your little brother۪s room. It۪s the only one that hasn۪t flooded yet. Once you۪re finished, you sit on the mattresses and stare out the window, hoping. But it keeps raining. The water keeps rising. Soon there are 3 inches on the floor. The water is rushing in at the front, the sides, the back. It feels like an invasion. You۪re supposed to be safe in your home. But here you are helpless, overwhelmed. Now you۪re standing in 6 inches of water. You use your phone to check the water levels of lakes, rivers and reservoirs near your home. It۪s bad. Maybe the Federal Emergency Management Agency has advised that people in your area evacuate. Snakes, alligators and other animals could swim into your home. Wet electrical boxes and downed power lines put you at risk. But your car is under water, too. Even if you could briefly start the engine, it would soon be flooded out. So you call 911, 311, any emergency number you can think of. Nobody answers. Or if they do, they tell you they۪re overbooked and you need to wait. Eventually, someone proposes moving to the attic. You۪re not sure and you۪re a little scared. But you know that if you remain downstairs, you could end up drowning. So you start moving the mattresses, food, two pairs of pants/shirts/socks per person, important documents, candles, bottles of water, lighters and your puppy to the attic. Like most people, you don۪t realize you۪d be safer on the roof , where rescuers can see you and reach you. It۪s hard to escape from a flooding attic. You start getting calls from distant loved ones asking what۪s going on. You lie. You tell them it۪s only a little flooding and say you۪re fine because you don۪t want to scare them. Most of your time in the attic is spent praying. Time passes slowly. You look at your little brother and you can tell that he۪s terrified. You try to calm him down, assure him that everything will be OK. Eventually, someone in the family tries to make a hole in the roof. If you۪re lucky,before they start chopping through the ceiling, you hear voices outside. A rescue team has found you. You file out of the attic and down the stairs, one by one. As you reach the bottom, you shiver. The water is freezing. At some point  weeks, maybe months later  you get to go back home. You don۪t know exactly what to expect, but you۪ve seen pictures of other people۪s homes after other catastrophic floods. In fact, you can۪t even open your front door. Something۪s blocking it.You have to find a different way to get into the house. Inside, there۪s at least an inch of mud on the floor and the mold on the walls is chest high. You۪re speechless. The windows aren۪t shattered, yet it looks like someone broke in and ransacked your house. Everything has been thrown off the shelves. You find items from your basement in your kitchen. Your knife block, with the knives still in it, sits in the living room. You finally reach the front door ۥ it۪s blocked by a bookcase so swollen with water that it collapsed in a huge pile of books and shelves. Your landlord has already come in and removed the refrigerator full of spoiled food. On your drive home, you saw fields full of refrigerators like yours. Your house stinks like dirty feet. You start the cleanup. You grab industrial-sized trash bags and put on masks and hazmat suits. You haul out bags of ruined belongings. The six-foot stack in your front yard lines up with others in the neighborhood. It۪s a graveyard for drowned furniture, appliances, clothes, books, toys. Then you rip up your floors and gut the walls up to 4 feet  FEMA۪s standard  as quickly as possible. If the water rose higher than 4 feet, you rip the entire wall out. You send in your flood insurance claim and wait for the FEMA adjuster to come out and assess the damage. Sometimes, the damage is so bad that FEMA doesn۪t need to send out an inspector. If you own your home, you try to hire contractors to help rebuild. You learn that you can۪t get your new kitchen cabinets hung until your new floor is laid down. The floors are back-ordered so you focus on putting in a new layer of sheetrock. If you move fast, you can finish repairs in just under a year. If you۪re lucky, your flood insurance will cover most of the tens of thousands of dollars in damage. But most people don۪t have flood insurance . In the aftermath of the storm, you can۪t find many places to rent. None of the hotels in town have space. You may buy an air mattress and stay in your gutted house. You may bunk in with family before moving to a new home in a new city. You pray it never happens again.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-republicans-graham-cassidy-health-care_us_59c03bebe4b0f22c4a8bf981","WASHINGTON ۥ There۪s nothing like a deadline to get things moving on Capitol Hill, and with a Sept. 30 expiration date for the bill that Republicans want to use for an Affordable Care Act repeal, Senate Republicans who once seemed resolutely opposed to even the most modest Obamacare repeal suddenly sounded less resolute Monday. The proposal ۥ authored by Sens. Lindsey Graham (S.C.), Bill Cassidy (La.) and other Republican colleagues ۥ would still likely result in millions losing coverage. The bill would still cut Medicaid, albeit over a longer timeline, and states could still choose to undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions. But the measure, attached to a reconciliation۝ bill that allows a simple majority vote, would give states more flexibility in deciding those cuts and coverage decisions. That flexibility has inspired Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) to come out strongly against the legislation, castigating the bill as a rebranding of Obamacare. Conservatives should say no,۝ Paul tweeted Monday. The proposal, however, is seemingly less repellent to Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), one of the three Senate Republicans who voted against the skinny repeal۝ in July, along with Susan Collins (Maine) and John McCain (Ariz.). Murkowski told HuffPost on Monday that she۪s undecided on Graham-Cassidy, as the measure is known, and that she and her staff were still looking۝ to see how Alaska would make out under the bill. Pressed that it seemed as if her state would at least face less severe cuts than previous repeals ۥ an analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says the bill would cut Alaska funding by only $149 million over 10 years, while states like California and New York would suffer cuts of $35 billion and $22 billion, respectively ۥ Murkowski said the depth of those cuts was what she and her staff were trying to determine. A Congressional Budget Office score would be helpful in making those determinations, but the CBO said it would have only a preliminary۝ assessment next week and that a more detailed analysis on the effects of the legislation on deficits, health coverage and premiums would take at least several weeks.۝ Still, Republicans are trying to pass this bill now. Lawmakers and the administration have stepped up their lobbying of Murkowski and Alaska Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, in recent days. Neither Murkowski nor Walker is coming out in opposition at this point. When HuffPost asked about those conversations Monday, Murkowski suggested Walker was, like her, still trying to gather information. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who۪s been instrumental in the health care negotiations in both chambers, told HuffPost on Monday that the bill۪s authors and Trump administration officials realize that making sure the needs of Alaska are addressed is a top priority.۝ Whether we repeal and replace Obamacare comes down to a few key senators,۝ Meadows said. While Meadows wouldn۪t answer if that meant buying off those individual senators, that certainly could be a strategy in the coming days ۥ even coming hours. The entire repeal effort could come down to a small amount of money for Alaska, with Republicans perhaps arguing that, over the next 10 years at least, Alaska would be better off. (The trick with Graham-Cassidy is that it pushes back most of its cuts to years that may be outside of a CBO budget window.) Ultimately, if Republicans are going to deliver on their promised repeal and replacement of Obamacare, they will have to vote for a bill with unknown effects, and House Republicans from states like California and New York would have to back huge health care assistance cuts to their states. In that sense, the condensed timeline may help Republicans. Lawmakers may not have enough time to learn about the effects of their bill before they vote on it ۥ something that didn۪t apparently bother House Republicans when they voted on their health care proposal without a revised CBO score. Just like in the House, Meadows noted that the tight timeline had made for a better negotiating mood۝ for the majority of senators. Collins is considered less likely to vote for this measure, but she didn۪t completely rule it out Monday afternoon. She said backing the bill would be problematic۝ without a CBO score, and she has grave concerns۝ about certain cuts that Maine could suffer. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) both seem to be on board with the legislation, and other senators, including Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), seemed likely to fall in line if GOP leadership could win over Murkowski. Republicans can lose only two GOP votes if they۪re to even advance this bill to the House. That means they have to pick up some combination of Collins, Murkowski and McCain. On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) met with Murkowski and McCain in his office, one after the other. McCain, who was diagnosed in July with an aggressive form of brain cancer, said he wanted regular order on this bill, a process that would normally subject the legislation to hearings and committee markups, as well as the opportunity for lawmakers to get votes on amendments. And McCain didn۪t sound sympathetic to arguments that there wasn۪t now enough time for that regular order. I۪m not the one that waited nine months to bring up an issue,۝ McCain said. And we just went through that last fiasco. It۪s not my problem that we only have those few days left. What were we doing the last nine months?۝ Still, McCain said he was still considering voting for the legislation. His governor, Doug Ducey (R), came out in support of the Graham-Cassidy proposal on Monday, and McCain said it would be difficult to vote against legislation authored by Graham, his closest friend in the Senate. That doesn۪t mean, however, that he will just fall in line. I don۪t want to have to just vote aye or no on what۪s one-fifth of the gross national product,۝ McCain said. There۪s still plenty for Murkowski to object to ۥ defunding Planned Parenthood, long-term Medicaid cuts, provisions letting states undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Overcoming those issues may just be too challenging for Republicans, at least with only a 12-day timeline. A more likely scenario is for the GOP to push this Graham-Cassidy bill as hard as it can in the coming days, see how far it can get and then wait until next year when a new majority-vote reconciliation vehicle is available to them. It may not be easier to actually pass the legislation, especially considering how close Republicans will be to the 2018 elections. But the GOP health care proposals have died numerous times and come back to life. Even if this Graham-Cassidy proposal dies, there۪s no reason to believe it۪s the last possible chance for Republicans to repeal Obamacare.

Trump initially blamed  many sides ۝ for hatred and bigotry on Saturday, but eventually specifically condemned white supremacist groups after facing harsh criticism. But the president walked back some of his strong language on Tuesday by defending those who participated in the white nationalist rally and accusing counterprotesters ۥ whom he referred to as the alt-left۝ ۥ of also acting violently. Both Democrats and Republicans have pushed back on Trump۪s latest comments, including Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.). Moore warned that more violence was likely to follow Saturday۪s bloody riots.

So I think there will be more violence like this in the future to come.۝ A memorial for Heyer took place Wednesday. Susan Bro, Heyer۪s mother, spoke about her daughter۪s passion for social justice.

A now-dormant FBI investigation into whether Clinton had ties to the deal has not found evidence of wrongdoing. But NBC, citing multiple law enforcement officials,۝ reported that Attorney General Jeff Sessions has in recent weeks directed Justice Department prosecutors to ask FBI agents to explain evidence uncovered in the probe. Uranium One, a Canadian mining company with major U.S. holdings, was sold in 2010 to a Russian firm. Before the sale could go through, it needed approval from nine U.S. agencies, including the State Department. Because some of the people who stood to benefit from the sale were Clinton Foundation donors , conservative media and other critics of the 2016 presidential nominee have alleged a quid pro quo, even though the State Department didn۪t have the power to unilaterally approve or reject the deal and Clinton herself was not directly involved in the approval process. Following pressure from President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, Sessions last month said he would consider appointing a new special counsel to look into Clinton and Uranium One, as well as other matters involving Democrats. Sessions pledged during his confirmation hearing last year that he would recuse himself from any possible investigations involving Clinton. The Uranium One obsession among Trump and his allies has increased in recent months as Special Counsel Robert Mueller۪s probe intensifies into the Trump campaign۪s ties to Russia. Four people have been charged, including former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michael-cohen-trump-lawyer-russia_us_59a71a28e4b010ca2899e933","Michael Cohen isn۪t really supposed to be talking to reporters. The former executive vice president and special counsel at the Trump Organization, who also serves as the personal attorney to the president, sat in the back of the bustling Hampton Coffee Company in the tony beach town of Water Mill, New York, on Tuesday ,nursing a large black coffee. His two cellphones beeped every few seconds. Eventually he looked down at the offending devices. There goes CNN again,۝ he said. Friends and my attorney have recommended I not appear on air until after my testimony.۝ There was certainly good reason for his lawyers to advise caution. This week has seen Cohen, 51, take another star turn in the ongoing Russia investigation. Cohen (and President Donald Trump) have insisted for more than a year that the Trump Organization has had no business dealings in Russia. Cohen has been one of the president۪s most dogged defenders in the media on that point, taking his case to TV, Twitter ۥ anywhere, basically. Speaking to the Financial Times in December, he dismissed the idea of any connection with Russia۝ as yet another example of the press۪s liberal bias towards Mr. Trump.۝ But earlier this week, details of a planned business deal with Russia emerged in the press , partly because Cohen۪s lawyer filed a two-page statement ahead of Cohen۪s upcoming appearance before the House Intelligence Committee. (The hearing, originally scheduled for Sept. 5, has been postponed.) The statement reveals that in 2015 and 2016, Cohen was pursuing a deal to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. The deal was brought to him by Felix Sater, a freelance Russian-American broker, convicted criminal and former FBI informant who۪d worked with the Trump Organization on several previous projects. Sater said he could lasso a Russian partner for the proposed Moscow deal, and he pursued one with customary brio. In a November 2015 email, Sater told Cohen, who he has known for 30 years, that he would get all of Putins [sic] team to buy in on this.۝ He added, Our boy can become President of the USA and we can engineer it.۝ But that wasn۪t all. According to his statement, Cohen talked about the proposed project with Trump himself on three separate occasions during the course of the campaign. Cohen also admitted that in mid-January 2016, he sent an email to Dmitry Peskov, a senior member of the Kremlin, asking where the government stood on approvals for the tower. He said he didn۪t hear back, and the project never got off the ground. This goes against Cohen۪s earlier claim that Trump had no connection to Russia altogether,۝ not to mention Trump۪s own blanket denial from February:ʉI have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge, no person I deal with does.۝ I asked Cohen how it feels to be caught in a contradiction.ʉI feel great,۝ he said. Which picture did The Wall Street Journal use of me? Was it good?۝ He continued: I am in many respects just like the president. Nothing seems to rattle me, no matter how bad the hate.۝ As Cohen sees it, he is simply collateral damage,۝ a victim of the general ill will toward Trump supporters like himself. As proof, he showed me an email on one of his phones from someone claiming to be an entertainment executive in Los Angeles. Your a dick,۝ the email began, and escalated from there, with the sender threatening to molest Cohen۪s girlfriend. (Cohen is married.) He told me that he gets a lot of emails and calls like this. Still, his mood lightened when a man at the coffee shop approached us. The man said that he and Cohen grew up in the same neighborhood, and praised Cohen۪s TV appearances. You are Howard Stern meets Tony Robbins meets Ari from Entourage,۪۝ the man said. Cohen chuckled. You can write that if you want,۝ he told me. I showed him a tweet from John Podhoretz, editor of the magazine Commentary: Nothing illegal about Trump & people kissing up to Putin while running for Prez, even if for biz reasons. Gross but not illegal.۝ Well, he۪s right,۝ Cohen replied calmly. Though I would argue that neither I nor Trump were kissing up to Putin for either political or business benefits. The Trump Moscow project was a proposal that came to me through Felix from a Russian real estate developer. The fact that it needed government approval from the Kremlin is irrelevant. Putin was not the partner. He is the president of the country.۝ But if Trump needed the Kremlin to approve a major deal, wouldn۪t that have created the possibility of undue influence? No,۝ Cohen said. Their system is different from ours. The Kremlin has to approve buildings in Moscow. That۪s not undue influence. That۪s just the way it is.۝ I point out that for many people, it is becoming increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish between Trump۪s business interests and his political ones. And yet Cohen told me that during the campaign there had been no internal conversations at the Trump Organization about how to avoid potential conflicts of interest.  Everything was being characterized as a potential conflict,۝ he said. On CNN, they argued that unless Trump sold everything, there would be a conflict of interest. My comment [to them] was that even if he sold every asset, they۪d attack the buyer as having undue influence over him. It۪s the epitome of Catch-22.۝ Did the Trump Organization۪s stance change when reports started to emerge that Russia was attempting to interfere with the election? No,۝ Cohen said, because we had no involvement in it. We had the same information as the public.۝ How, then, does he explain Sater۪s email gloating that the Moscow deal would helpʉour boy۝ with the campaign?ʉTrump getting elected would have just been a bonus [of the deal] in my mind,۝ Cohen said. Felix knew that. He was selling me. What Felix was referring to was that [the tower] would distinguish Trump from the other 16 candidates by showing his ability to get along with foreign leaders who have not been well received by the previous administration.۝ Later, he added: I think it۪s essential that the U.S. and Russia work together as superpowers in order to bring stability to the world. This is why the U.S. people elected Donald Trump.۝ Throughout our conversation, Cohen maintained that Trump was barely aware of the details of what would have been a very, very lucrative۝ project, if it had gone ahead. He gave me an account of the precise numbers of minutes, and even words, that Trump expended on the effort. According to Cohen, when he first brought up the Moscow deal to his boss, he received a two-word response: He said: ۪OK, great.۝ The second conversation, Cohen said, was in the fall of 2015, when he asked Trump to sign a nonbinding letter of intent to go out to potential Russian partners. This meeting lasted approximately two minutes,۝ Cohen said. The third exchange happened in January 2016: I stated to Mr. Trump, while talking about something else, that I terminated the agreement. His response was another two wordsʉۥ Too bad.۪۝ And so, Cohen concluded, the entire duration of our conversations on Trump Tower Moscow, if you added them all up, lasted four minutes.۝ I told him it۪s difficult to understand why Cohen and Trump had denied having any dealings in Russia, if all these conversations were so innocuous . Cohen nodded. Some of it, he said, has to do with lawyers wanting to control the narrative. And some of it, he said, is just plain absurd. He claims that when he sent the email to Peskov, he had little idea whom he was actually reaching out to. By his account, he wanted to find whether the Russian government had authorized the Moscow tower. At Sater۪s suggestion, he says, he looked Peskov up. I sent my email addressed to Peskov to a general mailbox ۥ not his personal email, which I never had. I did not hear back from him.۝ Cohen characterizes this contact as tantamount to sending an email to [White House chief of staff] General [John] Kelly by sending the communication to info@WH.org.۪ It is certainly not in the Spy 101 Handbook for Stealth.۝ This wasn۪t the only episode that Cohen attempted to justify with an explanation that might have been a plot out of Monty Python.۝ There was also his alleged effort, in February, to help broker peace in Ukraine with politician Andrey Artemenko . This was controversial because Artemenko said that he had won Putin۪s backing for his plan, and Cohen allegedly delivered the proposal to Michael Flynn, who was fired from his post as national security adviser one week later. Cohen claims that this encounter was blown out of proportion. Felix asked that I meet him for a cup of coffee, as he wanted to introduce me to a friend,۝ he said, referring to Artemenko. Cohen suggested the Loews Regency near New York۪s Central Parkʉbecause it is two blocks from my house and they have good coffee.۝ There, Cohen said, Artemenko told him that he was going to run for president of Ukraine and that he knew how to solve the conflict between Russia and Crimea. His plan, which was one that is not novel nor unique, was for the Ukraine to lease Crimea to Russia for 100 years. That was the whole plan,۝ Cohen said. He asked if I could deliver a paper to either the president or General Flynn. He gave me a long brown envelope containing one or two pages. I never opened it and I never delivered it to either General Flynn or the president. I told him to send it to General Flynn at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. He asked me to take a copy in case I saw them... But I didn۪t deliver it, because I had no interest in what he was selling.۝ So, why the conflicting accounts about his role? Cohen raised his hands. I really don۪t want to go into it,۝ he said, except Reince Priebus later confirmed no document was ever given.۝ (Priebus, Trump۪s former chief of staff, did not respond to requests for comment.) The whole thing is so stupid,۝ he continued. When was the last time you saw a peace proposal on one piece of paper? SAT computations for algebraic equations take at least two pages or more. I truly hope at the end of all this nonsense that some L.A. screenwriter elects to turn this into a Netflix miniseries or movie called Sheer Nonsense.۪۝ He waited a beat.

It was canceled before it ever began, and the notorious provocateur was forced to offer refunds to travelers during a very sad press conference on Facebook Live. But Yiannopoulos doesn۪t go down without a troll. As he admitted defeat, he promised an unofficial۝ rally for his followers on Sunday, effectively mobilizing hordes of counterprotesters, anti-fascists and anyone in his far-right brigade brave enough to face them. We are going to be hosting an event, come hell or high water, tomorrow,۝ he said during his Saturday presser. He got what he wanted. The rally۝ at Sproul Plaza on campus brought hundreds of demonstrators out, including Antifa activists and Yiannopoulos supporters. Police set up barriers with metal detectors before letting them into the area. The British media personality showed up around noon to speak to a smattering of supporters and sign autographs. However, thirty minutes into his arrival, Yiannopoulos fled the area as his security detail escorted him to a white SUV. Sunsara Taylor with the New York City-based activist group Refuse Fascism called Yiannopoulos a salivating sycophant for Trump۝ and took aim at the White House in a speech to crowds. We۪re glad Milo got canceled but we۪re here because we have white supremacists in the White House. Trump and Pence have got to go.۝ Antonio Freeman, who identified himself as a bodyguard for the alt-right celebrity troll Baked Alaska, stood outside Sproul Plaza and scoffed at anti-fascists speaking into a megaphone . The 26-year-old Los Angeles area resident says he۪s part of the anti-government militia group Oathkeepers but opted not to show up in uniform. Freeman said he was here just supporting free speech. Just making sure people stay peaceful, that people are out here respecting each other and making sure things don۪t get too heated.۝ No bad optics,۝ he added, referring to the violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia, last month that left one anti-racist protester dead. No Charlottesville stuff. Can۪t have that anymore. Just a civil discourse.۝ He claimed to know Yiannopoulos personally but said he was more supportive of speakers today that are American citizens like his friend Mike Cernovich. But the alt-right icon۪s mere presence in Berkeley has been a huge burden on the community. The university said it was in the process of spending about a million dollars on security for the four days-long event, likely because the last one in February drew 1,500 protesters, violence and general chaos. Yiannopoulos  who the Anti-Defamation League calls a misogynistic, racist, xenophobic, transphobic troll who is extremely good at getting people to pay attention to him۝ ۥ used the episode to play victim and claim that liberal-leaning colleges like UC Berkeley fight against free speech. He did so again during Saturday۪s presser, and some critics say that he only organizes these events to declare himself a martyr when platforms and venues refuse to host him or when counterprotesters appear. He knows his trolling draws out only people who are ready for battle. Anti-fascist groups like Refuse Fascism were waiting in the wings to mobilize at any event Yiannopoulos threw, and mobilize they did. More troubling, in an email chain obtained by the Bay Area News Group, right-wing blogger Lucian Wintrich for The Gateway Pundit, who was scheduled to speak,told UC Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof that organizers from the event knew they wouldn۪t go through with it from the start. It was known that they didn۪t intend to actually go through with it last week, and completely decided on Wednesday,۝ Wintrich wrote to Mogulof. Wait, whoah, hold on a second,۝ Mogulof responded. What, exactly, are you saying? What were you told by MILO Inc? Was it a set-up from the get-go?۝ Yes,۝ Wintrich replied. During the rally, 18-year-old college student Edgar Magana wore a Dangerous Faggot۝ shirt ۥ the title of Milo۪s previous campus speaking tour ۥ with an American flag wrapped around his neck. He said universities across America are destroying Republican life on campus۝ and that he showed up to support free speech and Yiannopoulos, who he referred to as his idol.۝ The failure of Yiannopoulos۪ free speech۝ rally echoed a similar one in Boston in August. While dozens of alt-righters came out for the rally, 40,000 more counterprotesters met them with a message of their own following the violence in Charlottesville:White supremacy has no place in this country.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-obamacare-payments-insurers_us_59e01859e4b03a7be57f71a9","President Donald Trump plans to halt payments to health insurance companies serving the poorest customers on the Obamacare exchanges, the White House announced Thursday. Trump has threatened to withhold these funds, valued at $7 billion this year, since shortly after his election victory last November. The threats alone have roiled the health insurance market, and if he follows through, it promises to be significantly disruptive. Trump will make an announcement Friday,according to Politico, which first reported the news. In Trump۪s mind, dealing damage to the Obamacare market is a means to achieve leverage he believes will force congressional Democrats to cooperate with replacing the Affordable Care Act , the law President Barack Obama signed in 2010 that has brought the number of uninsured Americans to a historic low . Trump has been undermining the law and its programs since he took office in January, and he has ramped up his efforts in recent weeks in the aftermath of his failure to get the Affordable Care Act repealed by Congress . Earlier Thursday, Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to change regulations to allow insurers to sell policies that exclude people with pre-existing conditions and have skimpier benefits than insurance governed by the Affordable Care Act. The mere possibility that Trump would refuse to pay money owed to health insurance companies created additional instability in market. Insurers are raising premiums for next year even more than they would have as they try to protect themselves against financial losses if the federal government reneges on its obligations . The open-enrollment period on health insurance exchanges, such as HealthCare.gov and Covered California , begins Nov. 1, less than three weeks from now. The payments Trump plans to end are related to so-called cost-sharing reductions offered to insurance exchange enrollees who earn up to 250 percent of the federal poverty level, which is$30,150 for a single person. These subsidies serve to reduce out-of-pocket expenses for low-income people by shrinking their deductibles, co-payments and the like. Almost 6 million people , or 57 percent of Obamacare enrollees, qualified for these subsidies when they enrolled this year, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Under the Affordable Care Act, health insurance companies are required to reduce this cost-sharing. The federal government is supposed to reimburse them for the cost, and it has since exchange plans went live in January 2014. Trump will change that soon. He has the authority to do so because of a lawsuit then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) brought against Obama in 2014. House Republicans claimed Obama illegally made these payments without an explicit congressional appropriation of the funding. A federal judge sided with House Republicans last year but allowed Obama to continue paying back insurers while the case went through the appeals process. But when Trump succeeded Obama as president, his administration became the defendant in the case, raising doubt about how Trump and House Republicans would proceed. The parties in the lawsuit have obtained several delays in the proceedings in the meantime. The appeals court ruled in August that the attorneys general from 17 states and the District of Columbia are permitted take up the defense ,based on the state officials۪ concerns that the Trump administration would fail to do so. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced Thursday that he and those other attorneys general are prepared to sue Trump over the cost-sharing reduction payments. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders issued a statement on the president۪s decision Thursday night. Based on guidance from the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services has concluded that there is no appropriation for cost-sharing reduction payments to insurance companies under Obamacare. In light of this analysis, the government cannot lawfully make the cost-sharing reduction payments. The United States House of Representatives sued the previous administration in federal court for making these payments without such an appropriation, and the court agreed that the payments were not lawful. The bailout of insurance companies through these unlawful payments is yet another example of how the previous administration abused taxpayer dollars and skirted the law to prop up a broken system. Congress needs to repeal and replace the disastrous Obamacare law and provide real relief to the American people.۝ Congress could address the cost-sharing reduction payments issue by authorizing the spending in legislation but has not done so . Democratic congressional leaders denounced Trump۪s move in a joint statement. It is a spiteful act of vast, pointless sabotage leveled at working families and the middle class in every corner of America. Make no mistake about it, Trump will try to blame the Affordable Care Act, but this will fall on his back and he will pay the price for it. President Trump has apparently decided to punish the American people for his inability to improve our health care system,۝ House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a press release. The immediate effect of Trump pulling the cost-sharing reduction payments will be mixed. Health insurance exchange customers who earn too much to qualify for subsidies will have to bear the full brunt of the premium increases insurers instituted to protect themselves. Those customers who receive subsidies will mostly be shielded from the rate hikes because their subsidies will rise along with the premiums. Ironically, cutting off these payments to health insurance companies will actually cost taxpayers more than continuing them. Because higher premiums mean bigger subsidies, federal spending will rise by almost $200 billion , according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The news about the cost-sharing reduction payments comes just hours after Trump signed an executive order that could shake up the Affordable Care Act۪s insurance markets ۥ and quite possibly hobble them more. Looking ahead, however, ending the payments jeopardizes the future of the exchanges. Many major health insurance companies already have pulled out of the marketplaces, citing financial losses. In future years, it۪s likely fewer companies will want to participate in the exchanges knowing might not get expected payments.Some parts of the country would have no health insurance carriers in operation under this scenario, the Congressional Budget Office predicted. Experts and a variety of health care groups immediately warned that the new insurance plans the executive order might allow would also draw healthy people out of the Affordable Care Act markets, forcing insurers to raise premiums or shut down plans altogether ۥ leaving the people who want or need comprehensive coverage with fewer, more expensive options, or none at all. These are the latest moves Trump has made to weaken the health insurance exchanges: The administration has severely cut back on the Department of Health and Human Services۪programs to promote health insurance enrollment, including major reductions in advertising and in-person assistance. The administration also halved the sign-up period to six weeks and plans to take the HealthCare.gov website down for as long as 12 hours every Sunday during the enrollment campaign. The Department of Health and Human Services also spent money intended for enrollment support on a campaign that criticizes the programs it۪s supposed to be managing.

The report comes one day after the president۪s son Donald Trump Jr. released screenshots of emails showing he was contacted in June 2016 about a meeting with a Kremlin-linked attorney promising damaging information about Hillary Clinton. Trump Jr. has defended his decision to take the meeting, describing it as routine gathering of opposition research. Paul Manafort, then Trump۪s campaign manager, as well as Jared Kushner, the president۪s son-in-law and senior adviser, also attended the meeting. According to the Wall Street Journal report, the conversations were picked up by intelligence officials who routinely monitor communications (including phone calls and emails) between people believed to be involved in Russian spying on the U.S. While WSJ۪s sources did not say which associates were mentioned, they noted that the conversations included references to meetings between Trump۪s allies and Russian officials held outside the U.S. Officials are now reportedly revisiting those conversations in the wake of the Trump Jr. email revelations. Read the full Wall Street Journal report here. The White House didn۪t immediately return HuffPost۪s request for comment. But in a statement provided to BuzzFeed, a spokesman for Trump۪s attorney dismissed the story as double hearsay.۝ The FBI, under the supervision of special prosecutor and former FBI Director Robert Mueller, is currently investigating whether Trump۪s team actively colluded with Russian officials to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. Manafort and Kushner are both under scrutiny in the investigation, as is the president۪s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Flynn resigned from his role in the administration after it was revealed he discussed repealing U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country۪s ambassador to the U.S. prior to Trump۪s inauguration, and then lied about the nature of those conversations. The FBI is also reportedly looking at Carter Page, a onetime foreign policy adviser to the campaign, as well as Trump political adviser Roger Stone.

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-priebus-flynn-comey-firings_us_597d1c2be4b02a4ebb75e460","The past week was a tumultuous one in the West Wing, even by the drama-laden standards of President Donald Trump ۪s White House. White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci resigned on Monday, a mere 10 days after Trump announced his appointment. Just days earlier,White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus had resigned after Scaramucci publicly singled him out in an ill-informed crusade against leaks to the news media, describing Priebus in one interview as a fucking paranoid schizophrenic.۝ Trump, never one to shrink from a grudge match, was reportedly disappointed in Priebus for not punching back at the hedge fund manager-turned-spokesman informally known as the Mooch.۝ Amid the latest surreal palace intrigue, it is easy to forget just how many top administration officials, most of them in the White House, have either left or been forced out since Trump took office in January. It is common for presidents to shuffle staff over time, especially after major political setbacks. But the sheer number of high-profile dismissals and departures in Trump۪s orbit so early in his presidency speaks to the unique chaos he has wrought with his management style, behavior and judgment. Long before Priebus left, Trump pushed out several of the former Republican National Committee chairman۪s allies in the administration. The president transferred Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh to his outside political group in March. Early last week, Michael Short , an assistant press secretary with apparent ties to Priebus, resigned after Scaramucci hinted at plans to fire him. Trump۪s stinging criticism of Attorney General Jeff Sessions suggests he will churn through still more of his loyal deputies in the near future. What follows is a list of some of the biggest casualties of the Trump administration, in the order they occurred. We have not included the dismissals of acting Attorney General Sally Yates and Preet Bharara , U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, both of whom were holdovers from President Barack Obama ۪s administration. Michael Flynn Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn lasted all of three weeks as Trump۪s national security adviser before being pushed out . A leak in February revealed that Flynn, an early Trump supporter, had discussed American sanctions on Russia with Sergey Kislyak, then-Russian ambassador to the United States, prior to Inauguration Day. The revelation contradicted Flynn۪s previous statements to the contrary, as well as the similar assurances of other top administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence. Flynn has since attracted scrutiny for accepting a significant cash payment from Russian state-sponsored TV network Russia Today and for sitting next to Russian President Vladimir Putin at a gala for the network in Moscow. The discoveries about Flynn, who advocated for stronger ties with Russia, fueled suspicion about possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and the Russian government in its efforts to influence the November election. Former FBI Director James Comey confirmed in June that Flynn is one of the Trump officials whose ties to Russia are the subject of a criminal investigation. (That part of the inquiry is specifically focused on whether Flynn lied to FBI agents.) Flynn۪s brief White House career included bizarre episodes such as reportedly fielding a late-night call from Trump about whether a strong dollar was preferable . Prior to joining Trump۪s team, Flynn won praise as an innovative military leader while serving in Iraq, but Obama forced out Flynn from his position as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 amid concerns about Flynn۪s bellicose attitude toward Iran and fractious relationships with colleagues. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Flynn was criticized for espousing anti-Muslim views and leading attendees of the Republican convention in a chant of Lock her up!۝ aimed at Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton . Given Flynn۪s controversial history, one would think that letting him go would have been one of Trump۪s easier decisions. But Trump reportedly had more difficulty giving Flynn his walking papers than other senior staff members he۪s canned, and the president stayed in touch with him for months afterward. In fact, Trump۪s frustration with the pressure he felt to get rid of Flynn seems to have contributed to his decision to sack Comey in what became the most infamous of his firings. James Comey When Trump got rid of FBI Director James Comey in May, he apparently thought it would be uncontroversial. Comey, after all, had drawn the ire of Democrats for revealing in the final stretch of the presidential campaign that the FBI had reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton۪s use of a private email server. At the time, Democrats attacked Comey for breaching agency protocol on keeping inquiries secret, and they have since said the negative press his revelation generated at the last minute clinched the election for Trump. But the timing of Trump۪s decision led to suspicion from the outset. Comey۪s ouster came less than two months after the FBI director confirmed that his agency was investigating Trump campaign associates۪ ties to Russia and mere days after testimony to Congress in which he said the idea that his campaign disclosure about Clinton had influenced the election made him mildly nauseous.۝ The Trump administration۪s divergent explanations for the termination only served to fan the flames. In an interview with NBC News shortly after the firing, Trump strongly implied that he fired Comey for aggressively pursuing the Russia investigation and accused him of being a showboat.۝ Administration officials also claimed, rather implausibly , that Trump was punishing Comey for his treatment of Clinton and that Comey had lost the confidence of FBI agents. Congressional Democrats seized on Comey۪s firing as evidence that Trump tried to obstruct efforts to learn the truth about Russian interference in the election and whether Trump campaign aides attempted to collude with the foreign power. The fallout from Comey۪s firing became one of Trump۪s biggest headaches. Later in May, the pressure prompted Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to appoint former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a special prosecutor to investigate Trump campaign associates۪ ties to Russia. And in devastating testimony to Congress in June, Comey revealed, among other things, that Trump had pressed him to drop his investigation of Michael Flynn, something that many legal scholars believe is an impeachable abuse of power. Now Trump is reportedly examining ways to undermine Mueller by either pre-emptively pardoning officials or firing him outright. Mike Dubke Mike Dubke, who started as Trump۪s communications director in mid-February, resigned from the post at the end of May. In an administration known for its colorful characters, Dubke flew below the radar, rarely appearing on television or talking to reporters on the record. Little is known about the circumstances surrounding his departure, but Dubke۪s background as head of an establishment GOP communications firm that worked against Trump during the 2016 primary elicited skepticism about him from Trump loyalists from the get-go. His struggle to build strong relationships with other senior staff members isolated him in the White House, according to The Washington Post . Notably, Dubke also left following the weekslong brouhaha over Trump۪s firing of Comey, during which Trump frequently contradicted his own communications team. Sean Spicer White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who served as communications director of the RNC under Priebus, resigned abruptly on July 21. Spicer endured months of humiliation while defending Trump۪s lies and boosting his ego to a restive press corps. His relationship with the media was rocky from the start, thanks to a rant on his first day on the job in which he declared that Trump had received the biggest Inauguration Day crowds in history and then refused to take questions. Trump would go on to take issue not with Spicer۪s comments that day but with the light color of his suit. Spicer۪s daily televised press briefings became must-watch television thanks to his over-the-top explanations and inability to conceal his contempt for assembled journalists. His irritable performances were quickly immortalized by Melissa McCarthy۪s portrayal of him on Saturday Night Live,۝ which Trump reportedly disliked . Spicer۪s remarkable gaffes included his claim that Syrian President Bashar Assad was worse than Adolf Hitler , because Hitler, he erroneously said, had not used chemical weapons. Ironically, the impossibility of Spicer۪s job and the abuse he suffered for it were not what finally led him to part ways with Trump. Instead, Spicer left because he could not stand the idea of working under Scaramucci. He announced his departure after Trump shared news of the hedge fund manager۪s appointment. Reince Priebus Former RNC Chairman Reince Priebus resigned from his role as White House chief of staff on July 27 after a tension-filled week in which Scaramucci accused him of leaking Scaramucci۪s personal financial information. Priebus, the administration۪s highest-ranking representative from the Republican Party establishment, scuffled for control in the White House from the beginning.Trump۪s creation of a chief strategist۝ position for Steve Bannon and a senior adviser position for son-in-law Jared Kushner appeared to undermine the authority that Priebus expected to wield as chief of staff. In an interview with CNN the day his departure become public, Priebus denied that Trump asked for his resignation and declined to provide details as to why he decided to quit. The president has a right to change direction. The president has a right to hit the reset button,۝ Priebus said. I think it۪s healthy.۝ Anthony Scaramucci Former Goldman Sachs banker and member of the Trump transition team Anthony Scaramucci resigned as White House communications director a mere 10 days after Trump announced his appointment. He had formally held the position for only six days. His brief time in the public eye was laden with controversy. The same day he started in the role, Scaramucci gave a profanity-laced interview to The New Yorker in which he vulgarly attacked Priebus and Bannon. He also threatened to fire the entire White House communications staff over leaks۝ to the press.New Yorker reporter Ryan Lizza۪s account of the unhinged conversation is worth a full read. That wasn۪t the only scandal during his short tenure. Scaramucci provoked outrage when he directed comments about hair and makeup at newly annointed White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. News also broke days before his resignation that his wife had reportedly filed for divorce . The Monday morning of Scaramucci۪s departure, Trump tweeted that there was No WH chaos!۝ In a statement that afternoon, the White House characterized Scaramucci۪s departure as a way to give new Chief of Staff John Kelly a clean slate and the ability to build his own team.۝"
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/daily-stormer-nazi-style-guide_us_5a2ece19e4b0ce3b344492f2","Back in September, Vox Day, a Gamergate holdover who has assumed the position of racist alt-right figurehead, published a handful of brief excerpts from what he described as the Andrew Anglin۝ style guide. For the blissfully unaware, Anglin is a neo-Nazi troll and propagandist who runs The Daily Stormer, one of the more prominent sites of the white supremacist web. The passages selected by Vox Day in his blog post suggested that Anglin is persnickety about detail and presentation ۥ except on the subject of the Jews, who are to be blamed for everything.۝ HuffPost has acquired the 17-page document in its entirety, as well as transcripts from an IRC channel where the document was shared in an effort to recruit new writers. It۪s more than a style guide for writing internet-friendly neo-Nazi prose; it۪s a playbook for the alt-right. The style guide,according to Vox Day, was a set of directives for whoever might be writing under Anglin۪s name, the idea being that Anglin۪s army of ghostwriters need to maintain some sense of consistent style. But the guide appears to be for all of the site۪s writers, many of whom write under their own names (or at least their own pseudonyms). Last Friday, in an IRC channel, Andrew Auernheimer , a white supremacist hacker and Daily Stormer system administrator also known as Weev, began explaining to a group of people how one might start writing for The Daily Stormer: okay basically, it works like this, you can write articles, if we dont like them you can put them on your own blog or whatever, if we accept them for publication we will pay you $14.88 Fourteen,۝ of course, alludes to the 14 words in the old David Lane slogan, We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.۝ The double eights refer to the eighth letter of the alphabet (HH۝ or Heil Hitler۝). The number 1488 is a common shibboleth among white supremacists. We۪re sure they find this extremely clever. When one person asked if the site had any paid positions open, Weev dropped in a link and wrote, theres style guide read the site for a couple weeks, get a hang of the style and editorial tone [sic]۝ followed immediately by learn the style guide.۝ Like any such guide, this one contains plenty of discussion about the more mundane aspects of blog hygiene  grammar, formatting, quirks of house style. ωMuslim۪ should be spelled Moslem,۪۝it notes at one point. This is mostly indistinguishable from any other blog, whatever its opinions on genocide. While The Daily Stormer might seem like an amateur operation  if only because it۪s mostly run by a single guyʉ it is certainly not screwing around when it comes to presentation. This is no accident. The site۪s stylistic decisions, the subjects it covers, the specific racial slurs it employs  all are consciously chosen for the purpose of furthering The Daily Stormer۪s ultimate goal, which, according to the style guide itself, is to spread the message of nationalism and anti-Semitism to the masses.۝ Everything is deliberate. The guide is particularly interested in ways to lend the site۪s hyperbolic racial invective a facade of credibility and good faith. Or at the very least, in how to confuse its readers to the point where they can۪t tell the difference. The Daily Stormer, for instance, uses block quotes for much the same reason Richard Spencer stuffs himself into vests. In explaining why a writer should heavily block-quote mainstream news articles, the guide notes that it allows writers to borrow some of mainstream media۪s air of scrupulousness and good hygiene. The Daily Stormer also takes steps to mimic what۪s already familiar,couching its caustic ideology in something comfortable and easy to digest.More specifically, it۪s mimicking the defunct website Gawker (where, full disclosure, I used to work). While Anglin claims to strive to cover as much news as any mainstream news site,۝ as well as anything that people are talking about,۝his Google News alerts hint at a much more specific focus that would best be described as Hey, let۪s have a race war.۝ While the site ostensibly takes care not to explicitly endorse violence, Anglin and his staffers know exactly what it takes to send their readers into a frenzy. They also take pains to try and not turn off any readers who might be just starting to flirt with white supremacy. Again, this manifests itself in a concerted effort to mix the vicious and the mundane, which mainstream outlets have also accomplished , though entirely by accident. As for what those racial slurs should be,Anglin is happy to clarify. Women, of course, get their own set of epithets. Slurs get hammered, vitriol gets mixed in with The New York Times۪ facts, and everything always comes back to the Jews.Anglin is very explicit about what he۪s doing here: He۪s recruiting. The redundancies are obvious to anyone who gives the site as much as a passing glance. After all, there are only so many ways to say all misery is the work of a secret cabal of globalist Jewish bankers۝ before you start repeating yourself. Still, it is jarring to read Anglin explainʉ in such clear-eyed terms, no less  how he actively uses curiosity or the naughty humor۝ to draw people in. It۪s easy to think they are probably being deliberately manipulative.But it۪s also easy to think that a white supremacist recruiting conspiracy is insane and you۪re being too paranoid. You۪re not being too paranoid. And just in case you didn۪t quite get the message, Anglin goes on. All of this is aided by a veil of irony. Let۪s see that one more time. This is obviously a ploy and I actually do want to gas kikes. But that۪s neither here nor there. Remember this the next time you find yourself wondering if perhaps they don۪t mean it quite like that .Because they always, always do. And as with any good white supremacist platform, The Daily Stormer puts a heavy emphasis on memes (fresh memes are best but old memes are good too۝). This is largely to aid in the digestion of garbage. Anglin once again points to a popular liberal site (this time, BuzzFeed) as a model for smuggling in neo-Nazism. Also, 50 Cent. You can easily find Anglin۪sʉIn Da Club۝ rendition if you so choose.It evinces a disappointing sense of meter and rhyme on the part of the master race. You can find me in the club, bottle full of tea Look mami I got the Moroccan hash if you into getting headaches I۪m into gang-rape, I ain۪t into making love So come give me a hug if you into to getting trafficked As always there is a larger aim here:to humanize inhumanity. And meanwhile, he exhorts his writers to dehumanize their opponentsʉ dehumanize them, he writes, to the point where people are ready to laugh at their deaths.۝ As for how to incite violence without explicitly calling for it, Anglin has plenty of ideas. The constant line-toeing and the deliberate muddying of intentions and meaning can have a dizzying effect, especially for media outlets that aren۪t used to grappling with such bad actors.Anglin knows this, and he is doing everything in his power to exploit it. Remember this style guide the next time an alt-righter says something so hammily outrageous that you begin to doubt its sincerity. This is by design . The Daily Stormer and other groups like it want you to be unsure if you should take them seriously.Andrew Anglin wants you to think he۪s just a troll, that he۪s spouting incendiary crap for no other reason than to get a rise out of you. Remember that the irony and the coy misdirection are all in service of tricking people into following him on his path toward a white supremacist state. This is what he believes. You can read the style guide in its entirety below."
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-charlottesville_us_598f29c2e4b0909642973a6c","President Donald Trump on Saturday responded to the violence that erupted this weekend as white supremacists and a fringe group clashed in Charlottesville, Virginia. He refused to single out the activity of white supremacists, however, arguing that there was blame to go around on many sides.۝ We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides ۥ on many sides,۝ Trump said at a ceremony for the signing of a bill to reform the Veterans Affairs health care system. It۪s been going on for a long time in our country, not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama. It۪s been going on for a long, long time.۝ It has no place in America,۝ he added. What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives.۝ Trump went on to emphasize that he loves all the people of our country,۝ and called for Americans of different races and backgrounds to remember their shared Americanness. We want to get the situation straightened out in Charlottesville and we want to study it,۝ he said. We want to see what we۪re doing wrong as a country where things like this can happen.۝ Trump۪s comments were his third attempt at addressing the unrest in Virginia. Earlier on Saturday, he۪d condemned hate۝ and violence۝ via Twitter, but didn۪t mention Charlottesville by name or directly address any of the groups demonstrating there. He followed up that tweet with another one 41 minutes later , finally mentioning Charlottesville by name but not referencing the white supremacists whose rally triggered the chaos. Civil rights leaders criticized Trump for failing to squarely denounce the white supremacists who organized the rally. The president۪s remarks were morally frustrating and disappointing,۝ former NAACP president Cornell Brooks told CNN. While it is good that he says he wants to be a president for all the people and he wants to make America great for all of the people, let us know this: Throughout his remarks he refused to۝ call out white supremacists by name. In a statement to The Guardian۪s Ben Jacobs ,a White House spokesperson defended the president۪s reaction as condemning hatred, bigotry and violence from all sources and all sides.۝ There was violence between protesters and counter protesters today,۝ the spokesperson said. David Duke, a white nationalist and supporter of Trump, criticized the president۪s initial statement, arguing that it was White Americans who put you in the presidency.۝ Duke said Saturday that the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville is in line with Trump۪s promises.۝ We are going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump,۝ Duke said. That۪s what we believed in. That۪s why we voted for Donald Trump, because he said he۪s going to take our country back.۝ Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer thanked Trump for his statement: Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) declared a state of emergency Saturday as fistfights broke out in streets, objects were thrown and reporters were covered in raw sewage. The White House said it has been in contact with McAuliffe۪s office, and Tom Bossert, Trump۪s homeland security adviser, has had contact with local authorities. First lady Melania Trump issued a statement Saturday condemning the violence, becoming the first White House official to offer a public reaction to the events in Charlottesville: The president۪s responses to incidents of violence have varied since he took office. He immediately condemned a June attack in London, calling it  horrific ۝ while criticizing London Mayor Sadiq Khan and calling for implementation of his proposed travel ban against citizens from several majority-Muslim countries. In February, he called anti-Semitic incidents in the United States horrible۝ and painful.۝ But his responses to other attacks have been delayed or nonexistent. In May, several days after the fact, Trump tweeted from the @POTUS account ۥ an official White House account, not the personal one he most often uses ۥ to recognize victims of a knife attack in Portland for standing up to hate and intolerance۝ in confronting a man yelling slurs and hate speech. Trump never issued a response to an attack on a mosque in Minnesota earlier this month. The violence in Charlottesville erupted in the middle of Trump۪s 17-day  working vacation ۝at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump has remained active on Twitter throughout his vacation, tweeting criticisms of several lawmakers, making comments on the situation with North Korea and retweeting stories from Fox News. UPDATE: 8:40 p.m. ۥTrump acknowledged those who died in the Charlottesville area Saturday ۥ including two people who died in a helicopter crash and one woman who died after being struck by a vehicle that plowed into anti-racist protesters ۥ in a pair of tweets Saturday evening:"
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-food-stamps-budget_us_5956a35ee4b02734df32408a","WASHINGTON ۥ House Republicans had planned to finally introduce a budget Wednesday ۥ already months behind schedule ۥ but then announced they are punting to July because they can۪t reach agreement on spending levels overall and cuts to food stamps specifically. A further delay on a budget bill could forfeit much of the Republican agenda. They need the spending outline in order to be able to use a parliamentary procedure called budget reconciliation,۝ which would allow them to do tax reform with only 50 votes in the Senate. So if they can۪t agree on how much to cut food stamps, they won۪t be able to cut taxes ۥ a priority for Republican leadership. Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas) is the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, which reauthorizes the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program every five years as part of a farm bill that also includes agribusiness subsidies. For weeks, Conaway has been trying to prevent Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.), chairwoman of the House Budget Committee, from including massive SNAP cuts in her budget. Black۪s committee has been floating the prospect of significant spending reductions since May. Conaway said Friday that they had a deal, though neither he nor Black would reveal any specifics. I will leave it to them to discuss the details of their budget when they are ready,۝ Conaway said in a statement. What I will say is that I am very confident that the agreement we have reached will give the Agriculture Committee the flexibility it needs to craft a farm bill that works for all of our various stakeholders.۝ If Conaway is on board, that suggests Black has agreed to relatively modest reductions to programs under the Agriculture Committee۪s jurisdiction. She has been seeking $200 billion in cuts overall, which would be spread across an array of unspecified programs. A spokesman for Black said only that the chairwoman is committed to getting a budget done next month. It۪s the strongest possible step to achieving real deficit reduction, strengthening our military and beginning the tax reform process,۝ Budget Committee spokesman William Allison said. Conaway has been holding hearings for next year۪s reauthorization since 2015 and has kept his policy plans a secret. One reason Black would want to cut SNAP in her budget, aside from the fact that many Republicans consider cutting SNAP good policy, is that the reduced safety net spending can be used to offset the budgetary effect of other Republican priorities, such as more military spending and less taxes. Over the years, SNAP has essentially been an ATM machine for Republicans so they can pay for increases in defense spending and tax cuts,۝ Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) told HuffPost. About 42 million Americans receive SNAP benefits, down from a peak of 47 million in 2013. The aid can be used only to buy food at grocery stories and markets. Experts have credited it for helping eradicate starvation in the U.S. , but the program, one of the federal government۪s biggest safety nets, has nevertheless been a frequent target of Republican criticism. An overlooked detail is that SNAP spending has been declining and that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office expects enrollment to fall to 32 million by 2025. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, laid into Conaway this week for his refusal to go along with Black and the conservative House Freedom Caucus in their quest to cut food stamps. Chairman Conaway۪s apparent unwillingness to cut a paltry amount of federal spending from his committee is a slap in the face to American taxpayers and jeopardizes historic tax reform,۝ Dan Holler, the vice president of Heritage Action, the lobbying arm of the think tank, said in a statement . In response, Conaway told reporters that he considered the people at Heritage advocates for raising the cost of food for the most vulnerable in our society for years.۝ The Trump administration earlier this year proposed a steep 27 percent cut to SNAP as part of an overall budget that would give states more freedom to set stringent eligibility standards. Such a policy would be similar to what House Republicans and President Bill Clinton did when they reformed Aid to Families with Dependent Children in 1996, leaving the welfare program a shell of its former self. We believe that welfare reform should be part of any reconciliation instructions,۝ Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, told HuffPost on Monday. Politico reported Thursday that moderate Republicans are strongly opposed to Black۪s draft budget. The moderates could potentially prevent it from passing the House. The House approved its Obamacare repeal-and-replace bill earlier this year only after party leaders caved to demands from the Freedom Caucus to make the bill more conservative. Going the conservative route on food stamps in 2013, however, didn۪t work ۥ Republican leaders added a bunch of amendments on the House floor only to see their policy ideas thwarted when the House farm bill merged with the Senate version. I۪ve been through the SNAP wars. It۪s a painful process,۝ Rep. Frank Lucas (R-Okla.), the former chairman of the Agriculture Committee, told HuffPost. If you use [the Agriculture Committee] as a cash cow for something else, that won۪t generate good policy.۝ Matt Fuller contributed reporting."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/russia-trump-internet-laws_us_59693615e4b0174186278e40","WASHINGTON  When Russian leader Vladimir Putin meddled in key Rust Belt states to help Donald Trump become president, he also may have exposed an election law loophole big enough to drive busloads of Macedonian internet trolls through. Fabricated claims about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton۪s poor health, impending indictment, even involvement in a pizza-parlor based pedophilia ring that were then amplified and recirculated by Kremlin-paid hackers may have helped Trump win critical states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. But it۪s not clear that paying for the creation or dissemination of such fake news۝ violates election law, campaign finance experts said. Getting at what Russia did, but establishing that they broke the law in some way, is not as easy as looks like from some distance,۝ said Paul Ryan, head of policy and litigation at Common Cause. We۪re kind of in a new world here. This is the first time in the United States where fake news was deployed and used effectively.۝ Investigators from congressional intelligence committees and the office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller are looking into Russian interference in the election and possible links to the Trump campaign. Had Trump۪s data operation shared information with the Russians or asked them for help targeting voters, that coordination would be enough to expose both the campaign and the Russians to election law charges. The Trump campaign, and subsequently the Trump White House, have for a year denied collusion with the Russians ۥ a claim that fell apart this week when Trump۪s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., released an email showing he was eager for negative information about Clinton, even if it was part of the Russian government۪s efforts to help his father. This is ridiculous. It۪s nuts,۝ said Richard Painter, who was the George W. Bush White House chief ethics lawyer. He pointed to Trump۪s public call last year for Russia to find Clinton۪s emails deleted from her private server. He basically encouraged criminal activity, told a foreign government to engage in computer hacking. People voted for him anyway.۝ The U.S. intelligence community۪s Jan. 6 report about Putin۪s work to help Trump says the propaganda campaign began with state-paid news organizations like RT and Sputnik. RT۪s coverage of Secretary Clinton throughout the U.S. presidential campaign was consistently negative and focused on her leaked e-mails and accused her of corruption, poor physical and mental health, and ties to Islamic extremism,۝ the report states, adding that there was a sophisticated organization to widely distribute that propaganda on the Internet through professional trolls.۝ The likely financier of the so-called Internet Research Agency of professional trolls located in Saint Petersburg is a close Putin ally with ties to Russian intelligence,۝ the report says. Trolls were located in other areas, as well, including Macedonia, where an unusual number of pro-Trump websites were registered. The number of people involved in the effort is not detailed in the Jan. 6 report, which is an unclassified version of a highly classified assessment. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, in March said there may have been 1,000 such trolls. If Putin did have that many people working to elect Trump, his operation was more than twice as large as the Trump campaign۪s paid staff in the final weeks before the election. And if each Putin cybersoldier was paid just $10,000 over the course of the year, that would put Russia۪s expenditure on its pro-Trump propaganda at $10 million, making Putin one of Trump۪s biggest financial supporters. Robert Maguire, with the Center for Responsive Politics, said the situation is similar to rich donors funneling large contributions to secret-money political groups to buy ads. The main difference here is that you have a foreign government paying for the creation of stories that get picked up little by little by various news outlets, and in some cases by the candidate himself from the podium,۝ Maguire said. Obviously, the aim was to influence, but man, this is so beyond anything we۪ve ever seen before. I mean, where do you even start with that?۝ Spending even a single dollar on any type of ad telling voters to support Trump or oppose Clinton would have been illegal for Russia, as foreign entities are prohibited from participating in federal elections. But the invention of false news and posting or reposting it on websites without paying advertising fees  that is not explicitly outlawed. We used to talk about illegally coordinating with Americans. The idea that they might have coordinated with a foreign government is mind-boggling,۝ Maguire said. I don۪t think I have the capacity to be surprised anymore.۝ Brendan Fischer, with the Campaign Legal Center, said he supports a broader interpretation of a particular law that be believes makes sense in this instance. Paying a Macedonian teenager to write a fake blog post and then repost it under a number of fake identities, Fischer said, shows clear intent to influence the election. I would call that an expenditure,۝ a term of art in campaign finance law prohibited for foreigners, he said. Of course, according to U.S. intelligence, Russian agents obviously committed serious crimes when they stole emails from the Democratic National Committee and from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta for release through the WikiLeaks website. In that act, as well as the disinformation campaign, a fundamental problem for prosecutors going after Russians or Macedonians or anyone outside the United States is the practicality of bringing them to trial. It۪s going to be hard to prosecute anyone overseas,۝ Fischer said. I would presume that the ones to be prosecuted would be the ones in the United States.۝"

At the point in the proceedings where an animatronic version of Donald Trump takes the presidential oath, comedian and actor Jay Malsky decided to add some editorial commentary. As heard at the 1:20 mark in the video above, Malsky began chanting Lock him up!۝ Over a loudspeaker, a Disney employee asked Malsky to sit down and be quiet. Another person yelled He۪s not real!۝ ۥ presumably in reference to the Trump robot. Later, Malsky told the blog Theme Park University that he didn۪t stop chanting until a few folks walked towards me and security came to make sure it didn۪t turn into a Trump rally .۝ Malsky had planned his actions in advance . Via Twitter, he explained the rationale for his rant: Malsky further elaborated on his protest in a emailed statement to Splinter: Donald Trump is a mad man with fascist tendancies [sic] who has persuaded millions of middle-class Americans to vote against their own interests. So I was worried I۪d be put on some sort of list (if I۪m not already) and probably incur the wrath of ignorant sheeple. But I figured a bunch of them would be at this ride and wanted to show their kids what a protest looks like before Trump murders democracy. If people are upset that I disrupted their family vacation, I hope they۪ll think about the thousands [of] children being taken away from their parents because of Trump۪s racist immigration policies, or the parents of the hundreds of trans people murdered each year by transphobic and homophobic people, or the negative impacts of the tax bill on poor and middle-income Americans. I encourage anyone outraged that I interrupted a ride at Disney to check their privelege [sic]. Malsky also emphasized to Splinter that Disney World۪s security team was amazing۝ and could not have been more professional and courteous to me once they made sure I wasn۪t a legitimate threat to anyone.۝ Malsky says he was so caught up in the moment, he isn۪t sure how the protest went over with other audience members. The first two tweets that popped up were one of support and one of anger so I guess 50/50?۝ he told HuffPost. Felt like I won the popular vote but the electoral college overrode the will of the people.۝ As might be expected, the video is getting a lot of reaction on Twitter, including conservative writer Ben Shapiro, who may have been joking with this tweet: Former Rep. Joe Walsh (R-Ill.)attempted to explain the difference between protesting the real president and yelling at a robot. Malsky wasn۪t having any of it. The snark came from all directions, some of it directed at Malsky, some of it apparently in support of him... Malsky responded to many commenters, including one woman who brought up that age-old question, What about the children?۝ The Daily Caller noted that Malsky has performed as Hillary Clinton in drag and called him the saddest person in America.۝ Malsky seemed unbothered: The animatronic Trump officially joined the Hall of Presidents cast on Dec. 19. On Thursday, Orlando Weekly pointed out perhaps the most notable thing about Malsky۪s protest: W e۪re honestly a bit surprised it took this long to happen .۝"
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/richard-jones-butler-county_us_595fb129e4b02e9bdb0c3b78","Drug overdose is the leading cause of death in Butler County, Ohio, but Sheriff Richard Jones says he has no plans to equip his deputies with naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal drug that saves hundreds, if not thousands,of lives around the country every day. Jones, a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump who has expressed skepticism about naloxone in the past, reiterated his opposition in a recent interview with the Cincinnati Enquirer . Reached by HuffPost on Friday, he stood by his comments. My officers don۪t carry Narcan, nor will they,۝ Jones said, referring to a brand name of naloxone, which is typically administered nasally and works by essentially blocking the opioid receptors that heroin, fentanyl and other narcotic painkillers target. Jones cited high costs and concerns about officer safety, noting that some overdose victims revived with naloxone can be unpredictable and hostile. In a recent interview with Ashleigh Banfield on HLN۪s Primetime Justice,۝ Jones said his position would change only if the courts order۝ him to begin carrying naloxone. Jones has made a name for himself as an outspoken advocate for a variety of extreme anti-drug views, including once suggesting the U.S. should drop one of its largest bombs on Mexican drug cartels . He told HuffPost that most of the responses he۪d gotten to his latest remarks on naloxone were positive, from people disgusted by the drug problem۝ and tired of inaction from national politicians. This Narcan, all it does is save people۪s lives for another day,۝ said Jones. You enable these people when you give them this Narcan.۝ Jones said he disagrees with experts who say addiction is a disease, and is frustrated because nothing that is being done is fixing the problem.۝ He said he۪s seen an increase in the number of women giving birth to opioid-addicted babies in jail and heard countless horror stories about young children being directly affected by the ravages of addiction. He also described speaking with one man who۪d been using intravenous drugs for so long that he now had to inject them into his penis in order to find a vein. Jones noted that just because his deputies won۪t carry naloxone doesn۪t mean overdose victims won۪t get revived. The life squads aren۪t just going to stop giving them Narcan, but it۪s pushing the resources out so bad and our government has no response, they have no cure, they۪re all too busy,۝ said Jones. Nancy Reagan, as silly as it might sound, you gotta just say no and you gotta teach kids and you gotta start in the 7th grade.۝ Butler County is now the only sheriff۪s department in Southwest Ohio not equipped with naloxone, according to the Enquirer. Advocates have been working with the Butler County Health Department to give free overdose reversal kits and training to relatives and friends of people struggling with addiction, as well as users themselves, who are often nearest to the scene of an overdose. Southwest Ohio has been hit especially hard by the opioid epidemic in recent years, with some counties seeing exponential growth in overdose deaths amid an influx of increasingly powerful opioids. Nearly 200 people in Butler County died of drug overdoses last year, with 153 related to heroin or fentanyl , a potent synthetic opioid that along with other analogues has fueled surging drug deaths around the nation. The county is on pace to see 263 overdose deaths this year, according to a June report by The New York Times . In neighboring Montgomery County, overdoses will claim 800 lives this year if they continue at the current rate. The crisis has led to some differing opinions on how best to respond. Last month, a city councilman in Middletown, which is located in both Butler and Warren counties, asked officials to explore the possibility of denying emergency medical services to certain individuals who had sought a medical intervention twice before. I want to send a message to the world that you don۪t want to come to Middletown to overdose because someone might not come with Narcan and save your life,۝ said Middletown council member Dan Picard. We need to put a fear about overdosing in Middletown.۝ Picard expressed concern about the mounting cost of overdose reversal kits, citing estimates showing the city is on pace to spend 10 times the amount it had initially budgeted for naloxone in 2017. Middletown officials have since said emergency medical services personnel will continue to revive overdose victims. In Ohio and around the country , officials have been giving voice to similar forms of compassion fatigue. Some have suggested that death is a foregone conclusion for many people addicted to opioids, and that reviving them repeatedly is therefore not worth the resources. These positions may speak to the deep frustration of communities in the grips of the opioid epidemic, but drug policy advocates say they۪re not representative of most officials in charge of responding to it. We see a lot of consistency and buy-in from law enforcement, fire and EMS on the importance of overdose response and harm reduction, and the importance of an enhanced overdose response,۝ Kelly Firesheets, senior program officer at the Cincinnati-based Interact for Health, told HuffPost. There are hundreds if not thousands of departments that are now carrying naloxone and are happy to carry it because they generally say it۪s a good thing for the communities and for the officers, because they like being able to do something at the scene of an overdose,۝ said Corey Davis,deputy director for the Network for Public Health Law, which supports increased access to naloxone. Interact for Health takes aʉnaloxone-plus approach۝ to dealing with overdoses, treating overdoses as opportunities for intervention and to connect victims to treatment. A lot of times we get confused and forget that naloxone is not treatment for addiction,۝ said Firesheets. This is a crisis intervention we۪re talking about ۥ we۪re talking about keeping a person from dying. And then there are other systems and processes and services that people need as treatment for the disease that is threatening their lives.۝ Firesheets also expressed concern that Jones۪ decision not to equip officers with naloxone would limit the department۪s ability to protect deputies who may come into contact with a number of synthetic opioids, some of which are so lethal that amounts equivalent to just a few grains of salt can be deadly. There have been numerous instances in recent months, including in Ohio , of officers being revived with Narcan after accidentally touching synthetic opioids and overdosing. Jones said the emergency medical personnel who typically respond to overdoses along with his officers would be able to administer naloxone should that happen. To Firesheets and others,Jones۪ remarks are evidence of the lasting stigma around addiction, which has become deeply engrained amid 40-plus years of the U.S.-led war on drugs.One of the chief policy prescriptions of this era has been that law enforcement should be a primary solution to drug use. The humanness of this sometimes gets lost in our discussion about policy and practices,۝ said Firesheets. These are real people with families and friends and kids and co-workers, and they۪re part of our community. That makes this challenging to wrestle with sometimes.۝ The views of people like Jones show that police shouldn۪t be leading the public health policy response to the overdose epidemic, said Michael Collins,deputy director of the Drug Policy Alliance, a nonprofit that advocates for the progressive reform of drug laws. They۪re not social workers, they۪re not doctors, and so they۪re often not best equipped to deal with the challenges of drug use,۝ Collins told HuffPost. Police will not get us out of the overdose epidemic. There has to be a public health approach, and it has to be an approach that۪s grounded in science and health and human rights and not enforcement.۝ Although treatment is a vital part of this equation, people have to be ready to get treatment, said Collins. We have to recognize that there are individuals who aren۪t ready for treatment, don۪t want treatment right now, aren۪t willing to get treatment, and the question is, how do you reduce the harm associated with their drug use?۝ he said. Collins brought up proposals like syringe exchange programs and safe-injection facilities, both of which have shown promising results, and both of which Jones told HuffPost he۪s skeptical of. Although these programs can be opportunities to connect drug users to treatment, Collins believes that even if they don۪t succeed in getting people to seek help, it doesn۪t mean they۪ve failed. The bar for the success of all these interventions shouldn۪t be have we gotten the user into treatment, it should be have we saved their lives?۝ he said."

I have this message for our friends in the intelligence community. The Department of Justice is open for business and I have, this morning, this warning: Don۪t do it,۝ Sessions said. For the past several months we have made changes and are seriously ramping up our efforts.۝ Sessions also said the department is reviewing its policy on media subpoenas. We respect the important role the press plays and will give them respect, but they cannot place lives at risk with impunity,۝ he said. We must balance their role with protecting our national security and the lives of those who serve in the intelligence community, the armed forces and all law-abiding Americans.۝ This nation must end this culture of leaks,۝ he went on. We will investigate and seek to bring criminals to justice. We will not allow rogue anonymous sources with security clearances to sell out our country.۝ Sessions noted that the department has tripled the number of active leak investigations compared to the number at the end of the last administration. President Donald Trump has raged against leaks that he says are damaging to him, and publicly complained that Sessions has not been tough enough on leaks. I want the attorney general to be much tougher,۝ Trump said last week . I want the leaks from intelligence agencies, which are leaking like rarely have they ever leaked before, at a very important level. These are intelligence agencies we cannot have that happen.۝ The investigation comes as the Justice Department probes allegations of collusion between Trump۪s presidential campaign and Russia. In June, former FBI Director James Comey said he had instructed a friend to leak a memo detailing a conversation with Trump about an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn , in the hopes of getting a special prosecutor appointed. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein did appoint a special prosecutor, but Trump has said Comey۪s leaks were  so illegal .۝ Sessions said Friday that he had tapped Rosenstein and Christopher Wray, the FBI director, to oversee leak investigations. He also said he had authorized DOJ۪s national security division and U.S. attorneys to prioritize cases involving unauthorized disclosures.۝ Sessions cited recently leaked transcripts of phone calls between Trump and various foreign heads of state as an example of a dangerous leak, saying no government can be effective when its leaders cannot discuss sensitive matters in confidence with foreign leaders.۝ Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, also spoke at the press conference and warned would-be leakers. I am empowered to take administrative action to deal with individuals who break the law,۝ Coats said Friday. I will not hesitate to exercise those authorities. Anyone who engages in these criminal acts is betraying the intelligence community. We feel the pain of those betrayals intensely.۝ For those out there who may be listening or watching these announcements, or who would later learn about what is said is morning, understand this,۝ he said. If you improperly disclose classified information, we will find you. We will investigate you. We will prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law.۝ UPDATE: 1:05 p.m. ۥ The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, a nonprofit, condemned Sessions۪comments on Friday.

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-obamacare-fail_us_596e8073e4b0000eb196a4c4","Before even taking office, and well before the Republican bid to repeal and replace۝ the Affordable Care Act, President Donald Trump started saying the best political strategy for his party would be to let the law۪s health insurance exchanges collapse۝ and then blame Democrats. As if on cue, Trump returned to this argument Tuesday, the day after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) conceded embarrassing defeat in his effort to advance the Better Care Reconciliation Act , his proposed vehicle for repeal-and-replace. At the White House later in the day, Trump was at it again. I۪ve been saying for a long time: Let Obamacare fail,۝ Trump said. I think we۪re probably in that position where we۪ll just let Obamacare fail. We۪re not going to own it. I۪m not going to own it. I can tell you, the Republicans are not going to own it. We۪ll let Obamacare fail and then the Democrats are going to come to us,۝ he said. Trump expressed the same sentiment in March after the House۪s initial failure to vote on the American Health Care Act . Let۪s be plain about what Trump and his willing partners on Capitol Hill are threatening. The president of the United States and members of the party that controls Congress are saying that they see problems in the health care system, and their plan is to stand by and do nothing while people suffer. This is breathtakingly cynical, and reveals the Republican Party۪s priorities. Getting rid of the dreaded Obamacare at any cost is more important to Trump and his party than acting to improve the health care system for the people they represent. Barack Obama is no longer president, but thumbing him in the eye and destroying his biggest accomplishment still outweighs taking even the most basic steps to provide relief to health insurance consumers whose plight Republicans have so often and so vividly bemoaned. Whatever its deficiencies, and however Democrats soft-pedaled them, the Affordable Care Act was an effort to make the lives of Americans better by expanding health coverage to millions, and creating new consumer protections against health insurance industry practices like refusing to cover people with preexisting conditions. What Trump is proposing is the opposite. He۪s threatening to bite off your nose to spite Obama۪s face. Rather than try to help people, Trump will actively avoid helping. Even if you accept his highly debatable premise that the Affordable Care Act is irreparable, what he۪s saying is that because he and the Congress his party controls failed, they will now do nothing to solve the problems with the American health care system they themselves have been decrying for seven years. Indeed, the Trump administration instead has taken steps to suppress health insurance enrollment and make the ACA function worse . Trump repeatedly has threatened to cut off payments the federal government owes health insurance companies that cover low-income customers, which would send the insurance market into a tailspin. Asked about those payments, White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders had nothing to say Tuesday: I don۪t have anything further than where we۪ve been the last several months on that. Nothing new to update.۝ It۪s an odd political gambit Trump proposes. What he۪s counting on is that, after he and his party failed to replace the Affordable Care Act with a plan of their own, and after the Trump administration has taken charge of managing the law۪s programs, voters in 2018 and 2020 will somehow blame the party that isn۪t in power for problems. To be clear, the Affordable Care Act is not functioning as well as Obama and the Democrats who it wrote hoped. The uninsured rate is way down , thanks to the law۪s Medicaid expansion and subsidies for private health insurance. Twenty million people who didn۪t have coverage before do now, and everyone has guaranteed access to health insurance regardless of their preexisting conditions. But enrollment on the health insurance exchanges is lower than expected. Premiums are too high for many households, especially those who qualify for little to no subsidy because even though they aren۪t wealthy, their incomes are too high. To keep prices as low as possible and to protect themselves from high expenses, insurers designed policies with large deductibles and high cost-sharing that make obtaining care too costly for a segment of the market that buys plans regulated by the Affordable Care Act. Some insurance companies have lost money because too few healthy customers signed up to offset the costs of covering the sick, although insurers are seeing better financial results this year. As a result of the problems in past years, rates rose a lot this year, and will again next year. Some big insurers have abandoned these marketplaces entirely, leaving consumers with fewer choices, including just one. Some states are doing much better than others, but problems in places like Alaska, Arizona and North Carolina are real and demand attention. Despite what Trump and other Republicans keep saying , the exchange markets are not in a death spiral.۝ Analysts at the Congressional Budget Office , Standard & Poor۪s and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation , for example, have concluded that these markets are stable or stabilizing, if imperfect, in most states. Still, Trump insists Obamacare is an unmitigated disaster. There۪s not much you can do about it,۝ Trump said in March. I would love to see it do well, but it can۪t.۝ This is simply not true. The Better Care Reconciliation Act and the House-passed American Health Care Act were not the final word in health policy. The difficulties facing the Affordable Care Act۪s health insurance exchanges in some states ۥ high prices, insufficient competition between insurers, high deductibles ۥ are fixable in smaller, more targeted ways. While he was in office, Obama proposed a slate of improvements both in submissions to Congress and in a Journal of the American Medical Association article . So did Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) pleaded with Republicans to collaborate on health care Tuesday, and House Democrats have proposed fixes of their own. Minnesota and Alaska already have taken steps to alleviate the cost issues that some of their consumers have faced. One simple solution is money. Bigger tax credits to make insurance more affordable would work. So would funds to backstop health insurance companies that have higher-than-expected expenses from sick customers. The Affordable Care Act actually included funding mechanisms for that very purpose, but Republicans in Congress rescinded the money , calling it a bailout.۝ When it was their turn to write a health care reform bill, the GOP seemed to recognize the need to support insurers in that way. Both the House-passed and Senate health care bills included more than $100 billion that would۪ve been distributed to states, which could have used the funds to shore up their local health insurance markets. The collapse of the repeal effort doesn۪t prevent Congress from taking other, more modest measures like that one to make the health care system better for consumers. At this point ۥ more than seven years after Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law ۥ legislating and regulating to make its health insurance markets work better is a responsibility Trump and congressional Republicans accepted when they took their oaths of office. This isn۪t helping Obamacare,۝ it۪s helping Americans. There۪s no such thing as Obamacare anymore. It۪s just the health insurance system. In the words of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) on the day he abandoned the original version of the American Health Care Act: Obamacare۪s the law of the land.۝ But if you۪re one of those people who can۪t afford your health insurance or your deductible, Barack Obama can۪t help you anymore. Donald Trump can. And he just told you he won۪t. This is an updated version of an article originally published on March 24."

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mcconnell-health-care-vote_us_5976a05ae4b0e201d57775c8","WASHINGTON ۥ The GOP health care bill is not dead ۥ at least not officially. Just hours before a promised Tuesday vote on a motion to proceed, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was still working behind the scenes to win the support he needs to begin debating a Republican health care bill. Republican health care bill۝ is all we know. After years of complaints about the process Democrats used to pass Obamacare, Republican senators intend to open debate without a single hearing, without a single markup, and without clear knowledge of what they۪ll be voting on . Republicans spent time Monday night defending that process. GOP leadership member John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) said it was absolutely۝ appropriate for Republicans to proceed, even without knowing the effects of a key part of their bill and whether it will take 60 votes to pass. When HuffPost asked Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) if the process was really better than that used by Democrats to pass Obamacare , Corker said: We۪ll see.۝ And Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), answering the same question, said he would just like to see a bill passed. The plan was for Republicans to vote Tuesday afternoon on a motion to proceed to the House-passed legislation. If that motion passes, Republicans could then put up amendments to replace that measure entirely. A repeal-only bill, a revised replacement bill, and legislation to give states the power to decide Obamacare all were expected to get a vote. It wasn۪t clear, however, what the text of those bills would look like, whether the provisions would survive the Senate۪s Byrd rule , and ۥ the biggest question of all ۥ whether McConnell has the votes for passage. Amazingly, the GOP plan just might work at winning Republican support ۥ an accomplishment for McConnell at this point. The biggest news Monday night was that Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) would return to the Capitol on Tuesday for the motion to proceed. It۪s hard to imagine GOP leadership bringing McCain back after last week۪s surgery if they didn۪t think his vote would be decisive, though McConnell may be trying to rally Republicans by using McCain۪s presence. (Who wants to be the GOP senator who made McCain risk his health to fly across the country to cast an irrelevant vote?) If McConnell can pull off this feat of beginning debate, no one should count out the Senate leader in getting a bill back to the House. But even if he gets 50 votes for the motion to proceed, McConnell will still face trouble passing a bill. Every previous version has had strong opposition from at least three GOP senators ۥ enough to sink the bill. McConnell still has roughly $200 billion to dole out to win over reluctant Republicans. And if the Senate begins an amendment process, it wouldn۪t be far-fetched to see lawmakers negotiating until they craft something that could get 50 votes (with Vice President Mike Pence breaking the tie). For weeks now, Republicans have been working on a Medicaid wraparound۝ amendment, which would give some states additional money to soften the blow of Medicaid cuts in the Better Care Reconciliation Act. That amendment could be key to getting undecided moderates on-board, like Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), even Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). Murkowski has looked like one of the toughest Republican holdouts. She has outright said she would not support a motion to proceed for the repeal-only bill, saying it would be devastating for her Alaska constituents, and she has raised concerns about the Better Care Reconciliation Act. But as of Monday night, Murkowski said she was undecided on the motion to proceed to the House legislation. Asked if she knew what Republicans would be voting on after the motion to proceed, Murkowski said she didn۪t. I۪m told we۪re going to be finding that out, which will be very important,۝ she said. McCain۪s presence could put additional pressure on Murkowski, in addition to Heller, Portman, and Capito. One aspect to this gambit is the order of the legislation on which Republicans will vote. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who plans to vote against the Better Care Reconciliation Act, but would vote for the repeal-only bill, has suggested he might oppose the motion to proceed if the repeal measure is not the first amendment after debate is opened. I can vote for a motion to proceed if we۪ll proceed to a clean repeal,۝ Paul said. Let۪s see how we do on that one. If it doesn۪t pass, they can put up their monstrosity insurance bailout bill.۝ I۪m not for them saying, Oh, we۪re not sure what we۪re going to,۪۝ Paul added. But asked point-blank if his vote for the motion to proceed was contingent on the repeal bill getting the first vote, Paul evaded a straight answer, saying Republicans promised people they would repeal Obamacare and he thinks they ought to do it upfront.۝ One vote GOP leaders seem to be counting out is Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). Collins said she would be a no on the repeal bill, a no on the Republican replacement bill, and a no on the House bill. But Collins said she couldn۪t say where she would be on a new bill, and would vote yes on a motion to proceed to a resolution instructing committees to come up with a bill. Collins said Monday that leadership had not contacted her in days ۥ a sign that even McConnell may have given up on her vote. Senators may go along with opening debate, however, just to soften attacks against them for not repealing and replacing Obamacare, especially if they can park a vote on one of the alternative proposals ۥ all of which look d estined to fail. For Paul, and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who have said they won۪t support the Better Care Reconciliation Act because it preserves too much of Obamacare, voting for the repeal-only bill is a good way to show their priorities and shift the blame onto moderates. For moderates, voting for the Better Care Reconciliation Act, but not the repeal bill, may be a way of blaming conservatives, as long as the legislation never comes back to life. Collins, Murkowski, and Capito have said they will oppose the repeal-only bill, meaning it stands little chance of passing. And Collins, Paul, Lee, and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) have all said they will oppose the Better Care Reconciliation Act, with a handful of moderates remaining cagey about where they stand. If all the bills are going down, it isn۪t exactly clear why McConnell would want to go through the exercise of opening debate, unless he actually thinks he can get the bill over the finish line. If senators like Heller, who said he would vote against the motion to proceed for an earlier version, are just going to vote against the repeal-only bill and the Better Care Reconciliation Act, it might look odd if he supports the motion to proceed, though Republicans could always say they thought it was appropriate for the Senate to begin debate. But GOP leadership and President Donald Trump seem to be treating the motion to proceed as if it were support of the legislation itself. Maybe there۪s something else we don۪t know."
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-opioid-emergency_us_59e52816e4b02a215b326f29","President Donald Trump on Thursday formally declared a public health emergency for the opioid crisis, an action that has been more than two months in the making. Families,communities and citizens across our country are currently dealing with the worst drug crisis in American history and even, if you really think about it, world history,۝ Trump said. That is why, effective today, my administration is officially declaring the opioid crisis a national public health emergency under federal law and why I۪m directing all executive agencies to use every appropriate authority to fight the opioid crisis.۝ A public health emergency is less expansive than a full-on national emergency, which Trump had previously suggested he would declare in this case,even though they are typically rare outside the scope of natural disasters.Declaring a national emergency would free up billions of dollars in federal disaster relief funds.The public health emergency fund currently only holds around $57,000 , according to the Department of Health and Human Services. It was not immediately clear what additional resources, if any, Trump plans to direct to the opioid crisis. Trump first described the opioid epidemic as an  emergency ۝ in August. It was a reversal from comments he۪d made days before, in which he appeared to rebuff a recommendation from his opioid task force by saying he would not take direct executive action to address the rising tide of overdose deaths and other related public health problems. I۪m saying officially right now it is an emergency,۝Trump said at the time,during a press conference from his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. It۪s a national emergency.۝ Trump went on to say he was drawing documents۝ on the declaration, but the White House offered few updates until last week, when the president teased Thursday۪s announcement. With opioid overdoses now claiming an estimated 91 lives around the country each day,more than 7,000 people may have died from these drugs since Trump۪s remarks in August. Since then, Trump has also lost HHS Secretary Tom Price, the top health official in the nation. Price resigned in September amid controversy over his use of private planes for official travel. As a candidate,Trump vowed to take prompt action to halt the opioid epidemic, which has taken a particularly heavy toll in communities that supported him last November. But there have been few signs of urgency coming from the White House. In an interim report released in late July, Trump۪s commission on opioid abuse urged the president to take immediate action by declaring the epidemic a national emergency and expanding access to treatment to alleviate the crisis. Your declaration would empower your cabinet to take bold steps and would force Congress to focus on funding and empowering the executive branch even further to deal with this loss of life,۝ the report said. It would also awaken every American to this simple fact: If this scourge has not found you or your family yet, without bold action by everyone, it soon will.۝ Thursday۪s announcement appears to fall short of that. Among other measures, the declaration shifts regulations to allow for the prescription of medication used for substance abuse via telemedicine, and frees up additional medical personnel to be dispatched to states that request it, according to STAT News . Addiction experts were quick to criticize the plan for failing to do more to expand access to naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal drug, and buprenorphine, a medication that has been shown to be highly effective in treating opioid use disorder. This is a swing and a miss ۥ pretty much what you۪d expect from a White House that has been fighting health care access, proposing deep domestic spending cuts, and elevating posturing over policy,۝ said Daniel Raymond, deputy director of planning and policy for the Harm Reduction Coalition. There۪s little here that will bend the curve of overdose deaths, and a lot of missed opportunities.۝ Regina LaBelle, chief of staff at the Office of National Drug Control Policy during the Obama administration, applauded the telemedicine aspect of the order, but said it fell short in other ways. Such actions could have included building a naloxone stockpile, addressing regulatory barriers to mobile methadone vans, not to mention including more funding to address the epidemic,۝ she said. At a time when only 20 percent of people with opioid use disorders get needed treatment, we need to act with urgency.۝ Trump۪s opioid task force had initially been expected to release a final copy of its report in early October, but has reportedly pushed that deadline back to November.

Raiza Rehkoff, the director of public relations and marketing for the motel chain۪s parent company, G6 Hospitality, told HuffPost that staff members were working with ICE without the approval of senior management,but it ended last week when management found out. Regarding recent media story on Phoenix-area location, this was implemented at the local level without the knowledge of senior management,۝ Rehkoff said in an emailed statement. When we became aware of it last week, it was discontinued. We are currently investigating and will provide more information shortly.۝ Rehkoff did not respond to HuffPost۪s questions about whether Motel 6 condemned the employees actionsʉۥ i.e., sharing guest information with ICE ۥor whether any staff members would face disciplinary actions. ICE agents have arrested at least 20 people who were staying at two Motel 6 locations in Phoenix, according to an investigative report published Wednesday by the Phoenix New Times.Employees at both motels told the weekly newspaper that they were sharing customers۪ personal information with ICE on a regular basis. We send a report every morning to ICE  all the names of everybody that comes in,۝ an unidentified front-desk clerk explained to the New Times. Every morning at about 5 o۪clock, we do the audit and we push a button and it sends it to ICE.۝ Staff at the Motel 6 on North Black Canyon Highway declined to answer questions from HuffPost about the New Times report and instead directed HuffPost to call its national media phone number. There was no answer at the Motel 6 on 52nd Drive; instead, HuffPost was automatically routed to a national Motel 6 reservation service. The New Times report revealed that, of the 20 arrests made at Motel 6 properties in Phoenix, one-third involved agents knocking on a suspect۪s motel room door without a search warrant and asking for permission to enter. Yasmeen Pitts O۪Keefe, a spokeswoman for ICE۪s Phoenix division,told the New Times that these so-called knock and talks۝ were typical, but she would not reveal how the agency received the guest information, saying that they were confidential investigative techniques.۝ Law enforcement officials are barred by a 2015 Supreme Court ruling from forcing hotels to turn in guest information , which may suggest that the Motel 6 employees had volunteered to work with ICE agents. Empowered by the Trump administration and President Donald Trump ۪s promise to severely crack down on illegal immigration , ICE agents have ramped up efforts to arrest undocumented immigrants. In June, ICE Director Thomas Homan had warned that all undocumented immigrants  need to be worried ۝ and said that ICE would also go after non-criminal undocumented people. The agency shouldn۪t play favorites,۝ he told the House Appropriations Committee۪s Homeland Security Subcommittee. And these efforts have seen results: Within Trump۪s first 100 days in office, the arrests of suspected illegal immigrants rose nearly 40 percent . Phoenix attorney Robert McWhirter, whose client was arrested at a Motel 6 in June, told the New Times that reports of ICE agents knocking door-to-door for people who appeared to be Latino would raise concerns of racial profiling. We just don۪t know enough about what۪s going on,۝ he told the newspaper, adding, I۪ll tell you one goddamned thing for sure  I۪m not staying at a Motel 6 from now on.۝ McWhirter isn۪t alone. Since news broke of Motel 6 employees ratting out undocumented immigrants, many have vowed to boycott the chain."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-repeal-moves-ahead-senate_us_59776899e4b0a8a40e82ba32","The death of the Affordable Care Act has never been nearer after Senate Republicans voted to begin formal debate on legislation that would strip health care coverage from millions of Americans. The Senate adopted a procedural motion on Tuesday enabling the upper chamber to move ahead with one of several measures that would repeal major portions of the Affordable Care Act , otherwise known as Obamacare. Things could move swiftly from here, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said he wants a final vote on health care legislation to take place before the end of the week. The measure passed, 51 to 50, with every Republican senator except Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voting in favor. All 46 Democrats and both independents in the Senate opposed it.Vice President Mike Pence cast a tie-breaking vote in his constitutional capacity as president of the Senate. The vote set in motion what promises to be a hectic week of debate, amendments and votes in the Senate that will decide the fate of the Affordable Care Act, the American health care system and many millions of people. That could conclude with the Senate passing legislation to repeal large parts of the Affordable Care Act ۥ or with a crushing defeat. And no one knows how the House will respond if the Senate passes a bill or fails to do so. The House may quickly adopt whatever comes out the Senate, if anything does, or may insist on changes, which would prolong this process. President Donald Trump has been clear that he will sign any health care bill Congress sends him. Heading into Tuesday۪s vote, it was highly uncertain that McConnell would have enough votes to take Obamacare repeal over this first hurdle. This first vote was a real test of whether Senate Republicans were committed to undoing the Affordable Care Act, increasing the number of uninsured Americans by millions or even tens of millions and disrupting the health insurance market in ways that would disadvantage older, poorer and sicker people. Republican senators who voted for this motion did so without having any idea what legislation they were about to move on to. Many Options On The Table At least three pieces of legislation are up for consideration, and each of them might be debated and amended on the Senate floor. One is McConnell۪s Better Care Reconciliation Act , which the Congressional Budget Office projects would result in 22 million fewer people with health coverage by 2026.It would eliminate many Affordable Care Act provisions and replace۝ them with new reforms that would offer less help getting coverage to a smaller number of Americans, and it would cut Medicaid funding by more than one-quarter by 2026. There۪s also the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act ۥ potentially leading to 32 million more uninsured , according to the budget office ۥ which would undo central components of the Affordable Care Act without any form of replacement. At the eleventh hour, however, another contender appears to have emerged, which has been dubbed a skinny۝ repeal bill . This would erase the Affordable Care Act۪s individual mandate requiring most people to obtain health coverage or face a tax penalty, as well as its employer mandate that large companies offer health benefits to full-time workers and its tax on medical device sales. The Congressional Budget Office projected an earlier version of this proposal would lead to 15 million fewer people with health coverage and to 20 percent premium increases. In May, the House passed its version of Affordable Care Act repeal, the American Health Care Act , which would lead to an estimated 23 million more uninsured people. An Abnormal And Secretive Process The vote on Tuesday extended a highly unorthodox legislative path through the House and Senate. Neither chamber employed anything resemblingʉregular order۝ for legislation, such as open hearings and committee consideration. Republicans in the House and Senate also ignored warnings about the consequences of their bills from the health care industry, including organizations representing physicians, nurses and hospitals and patient and consumer groups like the AARP and the American Lung Association. As much as the House hurried its bill to passage, the Senate further subverted the norms of how laws are made. McConnell and his team constructed the Better Care Reconciliation Act in secret, and modified crucial elements of it faster than the Congressional Budget Office could analyze it. And the last-minute introduction of the skinny۝ repeal bill all but guarantees that senators voted to proceed to debate on a bill that doesn۪t yet exist. Later Tuesday , the Senate rejected the first of their series of health care plans. Under a 60-vote threshold, the Senate voted down the Better Care Reconciliation Act, 43-57, with nine Republicans voting no: Collins, Murkowski, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Bob Corker of Tennessee, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Dean Heller of Nevada, Mike Lee of Utah, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Rand Paul of Kentucky. This is only the first vote, however, and Senate Republicans look like they could pass a scaled-down bill that leaders have suggested would only remove the individual and employer mandates, as well as a medical devices tax. What Happens Next The next step is to begin debating and amending health care legislation. Technically, the House-passed American Health Care Act, is the basis for that, but McConnell plans to strip all the language from that measure and replace it with language from the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act, his office announced after the vote. Republicans will vote Wednesday on a repeal-only bill, similar to legislation that was vetoed at the start of 2016, and that bill, too, is expected to go down. Legislation passed via budget reconciliation must reduce the federal budget deficit, but the revised Better Care Reconciliation Act won۪t have been analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office before debate begins, and so its effects on the deficit won۪t be known. As a result, the language won۪t meet budget reconciliation rules and would require 60 votes to overcome a Democratic filibuster. Because of arcane Senate rules, after voting on this revised Better Care Reconciliation Act, the Senate will then vote on the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act language, and then move on to further floor debate and amendments. And senators from both parties will offer dozens if not hundreds of amendments during the floor debate to follow. This is expected to result in what۪s known as a vote-a-rama,۝ when senators cast votes on amendment after amendment in a row with no debate in between, a process that can last for many hours. In theory, there will be a full bill by the end of this process on which senators will vote. What it will look like, though, remains unknown, and counting votes on the various proposals and modifications to them is even more challenging than anticipating the outcome of Tuesday۪s vote on the motion to proceed to a bill. Republican senators from the conservative and moderate۝ camps have expressed a variety of misgivings about the options on the table. Complicated Rules Congressional Republicans opted to use a special process called budget reconciliation so any Obamacare repeal legislation wouldn۪t be subject to a Democratic filibuster and could pass with a simple majority. But this kind of legislation comes with limitations. Bills considered under budget reconciliation must directly and primarily be designed to affect federal spending, rather than create programs or alter federal regulations. Already, the Senate parliamentarian has told senators that key elements of the Better Care Reconciliation Act don۪t pass muster. Those include some related to abortion and to Planned Parenthood funding and others regarding health insurance regulation. The reconciliation rules also apply to amendments, some of which would require 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, which won۪t happen amid uniform Democratic opposition to this health care debate. Furthermore, Democrats will raise points of order arguing that elements of the pending legislation and amendments to it don۪t adhere to budget reconciliation rules, which could result in them being stricken. This story has been updated with the vote in the Senate late Tuesday."

While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don۪t think it۪s too much to ask NFL players to respect our Flag and our National Anthem,۝ Pence wrote on Twitter minutes after leaving the game in Indianapolis, Indiana. Following the example of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, NFL players around the country have knelt during renditions of the national anthem in order to protest against police brutality and racial injustice directed towards black Americans. More than a hundred NFL players from several football teams kneeled or held arms in solidarity earlier this month after President Donald Trump called NFL players who kneel during the anthem sons of bitches.۝ He later insisted his criticism of the NFL had nothing۝ to do with race. Trump said on Sunday that he asked Pence to leave the stadium in Indianapolis if any players knelt during the national anthem, an extremely likely event given the number of players on the 49ers team who kneel during the anthem before every game. The president۪s revelation suggested the White House orchestrated the walk out on purpose, raising questions about the cost of Pence۪s brief trip to Indianapolis. The vice president flew there from Las Vegas, where he visited the victims and families of last week۪s horrific shooting. He is now flying back West for a stop in California. NBC News reported Sunday that a senior Pence official said the decision to walk out was planned ahead of time . Wait. This was orchestrated to make a point? That۪s not an inexpensive thing to do,۝ tweeted Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) on Sunday . Many people have commented that Pence۪s action came off as publicity stunt, including San Francisco 49ers۪ Eric Reid, who was one of the first players to kneel alongside Kaepernick in 2016. Reid told reporters that the three-year-old photo of Pence at a Colts game in 2014 was the last he had heard of the vice president attending a game. So this looks like a PR stunt to me,۝ Reid told a pool of reporters on Sunday . He knew our team has had the most players protest. He knew that we were probably going to do it again. This is what systemic oppression looks like. A man with power comes to the game, tweets a couple of things out and leaves the game with an attempt to thwart our efforts. Based on the information I have, that۪s the assumption I۪ve made.۝ Prior to walking out of the game, Pence met with former Colts quarterback Peyton Manning. The retired football star, who also played for the University of Tennessee and has donated to prominent GOP figures , has been floated as a potential candidate to replace Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.). Corker is retiring next year, but Manning has said he has no plans to run for the seat."

The stance came in response to Trump saying the NFL should fire players who, in protest of social injustices, kneel during the playing of the national anthem.

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-charlottesville-moral-authority_us_59948dffe4b0d0d2cc83bc4f","WASHINGTON ۥ Franklin Delano Roosevelt once said the presidency is preeminently a place of moral leadership.۝ By drawing an equivalence between white nationalist groups and people protesting on behalf of equality, pundits and historians say, Donald Trump has ceded that responsibility. Trump ignited a firestorm of bipartisan criticism this week when he blamed  many sides ۝ and  both sides ۝ for the deadly violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and defended racist demonstrators there. Protesters in Charlottesville waved Nazi flags and burning torches, and shouted racist and anti-Semitic slogans as they marched, but Trump ۥ after describing racism as evil۝ on Monday ۥ insisted Tuesday that many people at the rally were there to innocently protest۝ the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. What Trump did today is a moral disgrace,۝ Fox News commentator Charles Krauthammer said Tuesday. Prominent conservative radio host Charlie Sykes called Trump۪s equivocal condemnation of white supremacists a  moral dumpster fire .۝ On the other side of the aisle, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) framed the issue in a similar way, tweeting : There is no question who he is. The critical moral question is: who are we? We can not surrender America to Trump.۝ Other Democrats, like former Barack Obama aide David Axelrod, wondered whether Trump would make some sort of effort to heal wounds and bring the nation together ۥ perhaps by giving a major speech, or even attending the funeral of Heather Heyer, the young woman killed when a driver rammed his car into a crowd of counterprotesters in Charlottesville. It۪s become increasingly clear, however, that Trump has no interest in taking such steps. During an angry news conference in New York on Tuesday, Trump parried questions about the so-called alt-right movement by asking, What about the alt-left?۝ While in the past he۪d been happy to issue moral judgments about other politicians, fellow heads of state, journalists and clothing retailers , here, facing questions about racism, he appeared to reject the role of moral arbiter. I۪m not putting anybody on a moral plane,۝ he said,after a reporter asked whether he was placing white supremacists and those who protested against them on the same footing. It wasn۪t just pundits and politicians who urged Trump to live up to the moment. Historians, too, said that with his reluctance to single out racism and bigotry for condemnation, Trump has ceded the presidency۪s moral authority and threatened America۪s leadership at home and abroad. Trump lost the moral standing to speak for or about America,۝ Harvard Professor Theda Skocpol told HuffPost. Every second he is in office he damages and endangers us. In this instance, he is directly encouraging organized, violent white supremacists who will bring public agony to many places for months to come.۝ Jon Meacham, a Pulitzer Prize-winning presidential biographer, called Trump۪s remarks on Tuesday morally ambiguous۝ at best. He predicted that Trump۪s behavior will further erode the public۪s trust in political institutions. We have to be in a position, both as a country and as a global community, where we believe what the president says, where you have some innate confidence that things are in fairly good hands,۝ Meacham said . And I think for a lot of people, that level of confidence started low [with Trump], and it۪s gotten to be almost nonexistent. So I think it۪s an exacerbating moment.۝ As Trump spoke on Tuesday, forcefully defending his initial, tepid response to Charlottesville, presidential historian Michael Beschloss tweeted a drawing of Abraham Lincoln with his head in his hands. Barack Obama biographer and Washington Post editor David Maraniss was more explicit, calling on all living former presidents to make a joint statement urging Trump to resign . Veteran NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw, meanwhile, said he doubts whether Trump can reverse the damage he۪s done in the wake of Charlottesville. He۪s going to have to find a way to stitch the country together again, and frankly, I don۪t know if he۪s capable of doing that in his own mind,۝ Brokaw said .

At one point, he tells her, I۪m a famous guy.۝ The recording eerily mirrors the infamous 2005 Access Hollywood۝ tape , released almost exactly a year ago, in which then-reality TV star Donald Trump bragged about sexually assaulting women.

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-republicans-bcra-vote_us_5977f7dfe4b0a8a40e83a2d4","WASHINGTON ۥ Hours after opening debate on a Republican health care bill, the Senate roundly rejected the first of a series of GOP proposals late Tuesday night: the Obamacare repeal and replacement plan that Republicans had been working on for months. The Better Care Reconciliation Act went down, 43-57, with nine Republicans voting no: Susan Collins (Maine), Tom Cotton (Ark.), Bob Corker (Tenn.), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), Dean Heller (Nev.), Mike Lee (Utah), Jerry Moran (Kan.), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Rand Paul (Ky.) But the GOP۪s hopes of passing some bill ۥ any bill ۥ were alive and well Tuesday night, with a scaled-down version of repeal looking increasingly in good shape after leadership revealed their plan earlier in the day of passing a skinny repeal۝ if lawmakers agreed to open debate. At this point, the idea is for Republicans to just pass this smaller repeal ۥ which will likely get rid of the individual and employer mandates, as well as a medical devices tax ۥ and enter into a conference with the House so that Republicans can come up with some larger repeal-and-replace measure later. At least that۪s how Republican leaders have articulated the plan. There۪s an incredible amount of uncertainty over the legislation, which hasn۪t technically even been written, and there۪s a fair amount of bad faith. Senate Republican leaders kept their members, Senate Democrats, and the public in the dark about their plan to vote on a smaller version of repeal for weeks. There۪s little reason to believe Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) isn۪t working on alternative legislation now in case the skinny repeal runs into trouble ۥ or, conversely, if he sensed that a bigger deal were within reach. Asked why Republicans were doing this smaller bill Tuesday, Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) made it clear that leadership was largely making up the plan as they go. Who knows what the final bill will look like?۝ Cornyn said Tuesday. I۪d be happy to have a comprehensive bill that 50-plus senators agree to, but if we can۪t, then the idea would be to come up with a core of pieces that 50 of us agree on so we can get to a conference.۝ For now, that larger deal looks unlikely. With nine Republicans going on record against the BCRA, McConnell would have his work cut out for him in passing a similar piece of legislation, as senators are now on the record against the bill.(Technically, senators were rejecting a procedural motion for the legislation, but this vote largely served as a proxy for a vote on the bill.) But the smaller repeal looks like it۪s in decent shape. Fifty Republicans voted to open debate Tuesday, with only Collins and Murkowski voting no. And even though there are a number of Republicans who could potentially vote against the skinny repeal ۥ Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) among the most likely ۥ lawmakers have largely tipped their hand. They have shown willingness to cave to leadership. They don۪t seem that troubled by the process or the legislation that leadership is using to strike at the Affordable Care Act. And their complaints of a bad process or a bad bill are just that: complaints . Among the senators who voted for BCRA was Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who spent part of his day delivering an impassioned floor speech decrying the process and the legislation that he voted for later in the evening. Johnson, who withheld his vote earlier Tuesday during the motion to proceed until he had a 10-minute conversation on the floor with McConnell, also ended up voting for the BCRA, as did Capito, who has made her qualms about Medicaid cuts well-known, saying last week that she didn۪t  come to Washington to hurt people .۝ But a Congressional Budget Office analysis of BCRA said it would do just that, leading to 22 million fewer people with insurance and raising prices substantially on older, low-income Americans. The skinny repeal, while a less robust piece of legislation, would still manage to do much of the same. The CBO has previously said that similar legislation would lead to 15 million fewer people with health insurance and 20 percent premium increases. The legislation would, in short, produce the sort of death spiral that Republicans accuse Obamacare of producing. Asked about the potential for that death spiral, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) suggested the skinny repeal bill would not be the final product. This is a legislative process,۝ he said. This is a journey. And we۪re not there yet.۝ Cruz added late Tuesday night that the replacement plan he voted for would likely be the contours۝ of a final bill. No one seems to think the skinny repeal will be the bill that President Donald Trump signs. House conservatives suggested Tuesday that they would not simply take this smaller bill. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told HuffPost there was no appetite۝ to take the Senate bill if it were just an expanded executive order.۝ And Freedom Caucus member Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) said he would have no problem۝ voting no on a bill if it were just a repeal of the individual and employer mandate. This is our one chance to actually repeal Obamacare and to give states flexibility,۝ Labrador said, suggesting he wants to see something that would cut at least some of the Obamacare regulations and decrease premiums. That standard could be difficult for both chambers to agree on, particularly if House conservatives draw a hard line on cutting regulations that would undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The measure Tuesday night needed 60 votes because of the inclusion of two amendments: an unscored proposal from Rob Portman (R-Ohio) that would offer some assistance to people who lose Medicaid coverage, and the so-called Cruz amendment ۥ which would allow insurers to offer plans that don۪t comply with Obamacare regulations as long as they offer at least one plan that does. The Senate parliamentarian has not ruled whether Cruz۪s proposal conforms with rules for the budget reconciliation process, which allows the chamber to fast-track certain measures. If the parliamentarian finds that Cruz۪s amendment should be subject to 60 votes, it could be difficult for a final piece of legislation to address the issue as well. And if House conservatives are making it a prerequisite that the conference bill eliminate at least some of those regulations that ensure people with pre-existing conditions are charged the same amount as healthy people, they could be setting up the whole process for failure. But if the Republican process has proved anything, it۪s that almost every Republican will bend on his or her stated principles to check the box of repealing Obamacare."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/woman-laughed-jeff-sessions_us_59a8cb8ae4b0b5e530fd7c8b","WASHINGTON ۥ Jeff Sessions ۪ Justice Department plans to put a woman who laughed at the now-attorney general back on trial yet again,a federal prosecutor told a D.C. judge here on Friday. Desiree Fairooz, a woman taken into custody after she laughed during Attorney General Jeff Sessions۪ confirmation hearing, will go to trial in November for a second time. Fairooz and her lawyer rejected a plea deal offered by the government in which she would have pleaded guilty to one of two charges in exchange for the government recommending a sentence of time served, Assistant U.S. Attorney Kimberly Paschall said in D.C. Superior Court on Friday. Chief Judge Robert E. Morin previously tossed out a jury۪s guilty verdict against Fairooz in July because the government had improperly argued that her laughter alone was enough to convict. This story begins in early January, way back when Sessions was still on Donald Trump۪s good side and was the president-elect۪s nominee for attorney general. Sessions, a hard-line conservative whose nomination as a federal judge had been rejected by the Senate back in the 1980s over concerns about his views on race , had drawn opposition from civil rights organizations and progressive groups concerned about his positions. Fairooz, a retired librarian and demonstrator associated with the group Code Pink, was seated in the audience for his Senate confirmation hearing. While introducing Sessions,Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) claimed his colleague had a clear and well-documented۝ record of treating all Americans equally under the law.۝ Fairooz found that laughable. So she laughed. A rookie Capitol Hill police officer who had never made an arrest nor guarded a congressional hearing before then decided to take Fairooz into custody. Fairooz objected, at first questioning why she was being arrested, then voicing her opposition to Sessions as multiple officers escorted her from the room. Fairooz was charged with disorderly and disruptive conduct and demonstrating inside the Capitol. She went to trial in D.C. Superior Court in May. A jury convicted her on both counts, but members of the jury told HuffPost they were focused on Fairooz۪s conduct after an officer took her into custody. She did not get convicted for laughing,۝ the jury foreperson said. It was her actions as she was being asked to leave.۝ The government, however, had explicitly argued during the trial that Fairooz۪s laughter, in and of itself, would have been enough to find her guilty. Morin, the judge overseeing the trial, rejected that assertion and tossed out the jury۪s verdict , calling the government۪s argument that laughter alone was sufficient to sustain a guilty verdict disconcerting.۝ He ordered a new trial. Coverage of Fairooz۪s trial went viral after the case was first reported by HuffPost, sparking jokes by late-night comedians and attracting the attention of Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, who wrote that substantial questions exist with respect to the application of law۝ in Fairooz۪s case. Despite the criticism, the government has indicated it wants another shot at convicting Fairooz and plans to start over again. The whole process ۥ impaneling yet another jury, recalling witnesses, etc. ۥ will eat up several days of the court۪s calendar. A trial date has been set for Nov. 13-14. Judge Morin said on Friday that he believed it was clear what he thought about the government۪s previous theory of the case that laughter was enough to convict. This time around, the government will have to be more careful if it wants the jury verdict to stand. Because they cannot argue that laughter was enough to sustain a conviction, government lawyers essentially have to concede to the jury that Officer Katherine Coronado, the rookie cop who approached Fairooz, made a mistake.They۪ll have to argue that, even if the officer was wrong to arrest Fairooz, she didn۪t have the right to loudly object to her treatment, or at least didn۪t have the right to make political statements that briefly interrupted Senate proceedings. Even if she۪s convicted yet again, Fairooz is highly unlikely to receive any substantial punishment, though jail time is theoretically possible. Two fellow demonstrators who went to trial alongside her received suspended sentences , meaning they wouldn۪t have to serve jail time unless they violated certain conditions. But the second trial still raises the question of whether putting Fairooz on trial yet again is a wise use of government time and resources. Fairooz said it isʉabsurd,۝ ridiculous,۝ and a waste of tax dollars۝ that she۪ll have to go through this process again. Fairooz told HuffPost on Friday that she had rejected the plea deal because it would amount to an admission of guilt, and she does not believe she should have been arrested for laughing in the first place."

Cohn۪s statement is no doubt true ۥ it just isn۪t exactly the message Republicans want to send as they argue that their bill isn۪t just a sop for the rich and powerful.

It isn۪t often that politicians admit that their failure to pass legislation will impact their ability to collect money for their campaigns.

(Donors) would be mortified if we didn۪t live up to what we۪ve committed to on tax reform,۝ Steven Law, the head of Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC affiliated with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), told the New York Post . Those big donors are already trying to push the tax cut legislation across the finish line by spending tens of millions of dollars on political advertising. Nonprofit groups that do not disclose their donors, like 45Committee, American Action Network, America First, Americans for Prosperity, and Freedom Partners, plan to spend at least $43 million on a campaign to pressure specific members of Congress to pass the bill, according to the The Wall Street Journal . 45Committee was founded by Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino oligarch, and Joe Ricketts, the billionaire owner of the Chicago Cubs who recently shuttered multiple news organizations he ran after the workers voted to unionize. Billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch run Americans for Prosperity and Freedom Partners, which are funded by a network of multi-millionaires and billionaires from across the country. American Action Network۪s board of directors includes lobbyists and strategic advisers to lobbying firms hired to influence the tax legislation. Academic studies have shown that the wealthy have both an inordinate amount of influence over policy while holding dramatically different policy priorities than the rest of the population. Cohn and Republican lawmakers۪ remarks make that clear ۥ and happen to play directly into congressional Democrats۪ line of attack against the tax cut bill. Their pay masters, if you will ۥ the hard, hard right ... the Koch brothers ۥ all they want to do is cut taxes,۝Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told HuffPost on Tuesday. They don۪t care about the deficit, they don۪t care about the country, they don۪t care about the middle class ۥ they just want their taxes reduced. And they run the Republican Party.۝ Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) made the same argument in an op-ed for The Washington Post : The Republican leadership has outsourced its economic agenda to a handful of billionaires and corporate donors.۝ Representative Chris Collins confessed that donors are telling him to cut their taxes or don۪t ever call again,۪۝ Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) tweeted . That۪s why this bill raises taxes on middle-class families.۝ Republicans۪series of telling gaffes confirming Democratic Party critiques of their agenda wouldn۪t be complete without one from President Donald Trump. In a phone call urging Democrats to support the bill, the president ۥ a billionaire and former political donor himself ۥ reportedly told them, My accountant called me and said, You۪re going to get killed in this bill۪ ۝ if it doesn۪t include an estate tax cut.

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-transgender-military-service-ban-republican-opposition_us_5978bbb4e4b0e201d57a65b4","WASHINGTON ۥ White House officials argued Wednesday that President Donald Trump ۪s seemingly sudden decision to ban transgender people from serving in the military could hurt the political prospects of Democrats, ignoring the bipartisan opposition to Trump۪s announcement. Soon after Trump announced his decision in a series of tweets, a White House official told Axios reporter Jonathan Swan that itʉforces Democrats in Rust Belt states like Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin, to take complete ownership of this issue,۝ citing the re-election chances of potentially vulnerable Democratic senators in 2018. Another White House official clarified to The Washington Post that politics was never an impetus۝ for Trump۪s decision but said that it will be fun to watch some of them [Democrats] have to defend this.۝ As expected, many Democrats swiftly condemned Trump۪s announcement Wednesday morning. Yet several Republican lawmakers, including those with military experience, quickly expressed their opposition as well, demonstrating bipartisan interest in the issue. Trump۪s decision seemed to be a move to appeal to the GOP۪s conservative base . Yet, many of the Republicans who swiftly spoke out against it have tended to support socially conservative policies. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, was one of the last to support overturning Don۪t Ask Don۪t Tell,۝ which previously banned openly LGBTQ people from serving in the military. But in a statement Wednesday, he argued against Trump۪s ban, saying that anyone who is qualified to serve should be allowed to do so. Any American who meets current medical and readiness standards should be allowed to continue serving. There is no reason to force service members who are able to fight, train, and deploy to leave the military  regardless of their gender identity,۝ McCain said. We should all be guided by the principle that any American who wants to serve our country and is able to meet the standards should have the opportunity to do so  and should be treated as the patriots they are.۝ Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), an Iraq War veteran, expressed similar opposition. Americans who are qualified and can meet the standards to serve in the military should be afforded that opportunity,۝ she said in a statement . Given both McCain and Ernst۪s military service, their statements appeared to push back on Trump۪s claim that allowing transgender people to serve would create disruption۝ in the military, highlighting the opposition of prominent conservative veterans.The president۪s assertion is one that many conservatives have used to argue against allowing all sorts of groups to serve, from women, to people of color, to LGBTQ people. I۪m all about training standards. High, high standards for whoever joins the military,۝Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), who served in the Marines, told HuffPost. But my initial reaction is, if you can can meet those standards, we shouldn۪t care who you are. So, meet the standards, and you should be able to join the military.۝ Upon hearing of Trump۪s tweets Wednesday morning, Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said that current policy allows for a big tent for people who want to serve,۝ adding that military service is voluntary. You ought to treat everybody fairly, and you ought to give everybody a chance to serve,۝ he told CNN. In a statement, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said: I don۪t think we should be discriminating against anyone. Transgender people are people, and deserve the best we can do for them.۝ Igor Bobic contributed reporting."

Read Frazier۪s full statement below: I am deeply ashamed of the way the President of the United States has treated the veterans during an honoring ceremony at the White House. Veterans are brave heroes who sacrificed everything, despite the historical trauma to tribal nations, when asked to defend the United States. Absolutely nothing should have taken away from honoring the veterans for their contributions to the war that ensured the American way of life. The President of the United States had an opportunity to honor veterans and bridge gaps in the relationship Tribes have with the Federal government. Instead, he chose to disgrace himself, his position and the nation he represents. It has been more than 200 years of living together yet the President of the United States knows nothing about us.

Pocahontas was only a child when she became a victim of rape, kidnapping, imprisonment, and her forced conversion to Christianity. What happened to Pocahontas is still happening today to our women. Native American women continue to be victims of rape and exploitation by white men. The President of the United States is practicing that by exploiting native women as an insult for political machismo. Pocahontas is beloved by native people and is recognized as a victim of European colonialism. To use her name in that manner is disgusting and reflective of the President of the United States۪ ignorance. This President of the United States does not deserve to represent the American people if he cannot acknowledge the contributions of the people who make America great.

Al Franken (D-Minn.) are different from those President Donald Trump has faced because Trump has denied any wrongdoing. A reporter asked Sanders during the daily press briefing if it would be fair to investigate the claims of sexual assault that more than a dozen women made about Trump during the 2016 campaign. Senators are currently calling for an ethics investigation into whether Franken should keep his seat ۥ a probe that Franken himself says he supports. I think that this was covered pretty extensively during the campaign,۝ Sanders said.ʉWe addressed that then. The American people, I think, spoke very loud and clear when they elected this president.۝ How is this different?۝ the reporter asked. I think in one case specifically,Sen. Franken has admitted wrongdoing, and the president hasn۪t,۝ Sanders replied. I think that۪s a very clear distinction.۝ Franken, who on Thursday was accused of kissing and groping anchor Leeann Tweeden in 2006 without her consent, has issued an apology. I certainly don۪t remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann,۝ he said. As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn۪t. I shouldn۪t have done it.۝ Trump tweeted later Thursday about the allegations, referring to a photo that appears to show Franken touching Tweeden۪s breasts while she was asleep. Trump has denied all of the allegations against him. And last month, Sanders said the official position of the White House is that all 16 women who accused Trump of sexual misconduct are lying. We۪ve been clear on that from the beginning and the president has spoken on it,۝ she said at the time. Trump has also brushed off his own boasts of grabbing women by the pussy۝ ۥ a comment famously captured on a 2005  Access Hollywood ۝ tape ۥ as locker room talk.۝ During Friday۪s briefing, Sanders continued to dodge questions about Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. Multiple women have accused Moore of sexually harassing or assaulting them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. Sanders called the allegations against the Republican nominee troubling,۝ but declined to say whether Trump believes them. He feels like it۪s up to the governor and the people in the state of Alabama to make a determination on whether or not they delay that election or whether or not they support and vote for Roy Moore,۝ she said.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-republicans-tax-brackets-brady_us_5a3a74b8e4b0b0e5a79ec354","WASHINGTON ۥ House Republicans swear they had enough time to review a 500-page conference report released last Friday night before they voted on what they thought would be the final tax bill Tuesday. (They actually had to vote on the bill again Wednesday because of a parliamentary mishap .) But when we asked GOP lawmakers supporting the legislation this week for just one basic detail of the bill ۥ the tax bracket percentages for individual income ۥ hardly anyone could list them. HuffPost had to ask 18 House Republicans to identify the tax brackets before we finally came across one member who could: Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah. (We stopped asking after Stewart, meaning the percentage of the House GOP conference who knew this key aspect of the bill could have been much worse than our imperfect survey suggests.) To be clear, we were just looking for seven figures: 10 percent, 12 percent, 22 percent, 24 percent, 32 percent, 35 percent and 37 percent. We were not looking for congressional representatives to display some savant-like ability and provide the income thresholds for each bracket. We just wanted to see if Republicans knew this one simple element of a bill they were rushing into law. They didn۪t. Among the GOP lawmakers who were shaky on those specifics were members of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, the chairwoman of the House Budget Committee (Rep. Diane Black of Tennessee) and the lead author of the bill in the House (Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady of Texas). So the seven brackets?۝ Brady said when we asked him. So you got them right there. I۪m heading to the floor and finishing my remarks on this tax cut and reform jobs act, so thank you.۝ When we pressed Brady again to name the brackets, he dismissed the question. So please, please. Seriously? I would like to finish my job,۝ he said. Even though Brady almost certainly should know the brackets in a tax bill he is authoring, the Ways and Means chairman was in good company. We repeatedly asked Budget Chairwoman Black, who repeatedly claimed she knew the brackets, but would not say them. At one point during our impromptu interview, an aide started a conversation in the elevator so the congresswoman could avoid the question. And then Black left the elevator for the House floor;we trailed behind still asking for the brackets with Black still saying she knew them without providing any proof. As the head of the Budget Committee, Black oversaw the budget vehicle that allowed Republicans to pass the tax bill through a special legislative process without any Democratic support. A number of House Republicans eventually admitted they didn۪t know the brackets off the top of my head.۝ Those were the words of Rep. David McKinley (R-W.Va.). And Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.). And Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn.). Other Republicans tried their best to squirm away from the question. Rep. Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.) claimed she knew the brackets, but wouldn۪t list them when we repeatedly asked. Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) said he could probably answer the question, but, loosely summoning Albert Einstein, added, Why remember what you can write down?۝ And Rep. Billy Long (R-Mo.), who was happy to tell us that Republicans were getting more familiar with the bill, went mute after we asked about the brackets. Still other Republican representatives tried their best to guess the brackets, including Roger Williams (R-Texas), Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) and Chris Collins (R-N.Y.). Gallagher and Cramer were close, but each left out one or two. Asking those members of Congress to name the seven tax brackets was, of course, a gotcha question. It was also an entirely fair question ۥ listen to our interviews below and you can hear that the lawmakers knew they were supposed to know. Republicans began their quest for tax reform by promising a simpler tax code ۥ one with fewer brackets, even though the relationship between brackets and simplicity is tenuous at best. Still, by their own words, reducing the number of brackets was a key goal. And the bill would be slightly easier to comprehend if there were fewer brackets ۥ which there aren۪t ۥalthough it still wouldn۪t really be easier to file your taxes. Part of the reason House Republicans were so unfamiliar with the numbers was because House Republicans ended up swallowing the Senate۪s tax bracket proposal, along with a number of deductions that the House eliminated but the Senate kept. (That also undermined the House GOP۪s claims about simplicity.) While the final bill was supposed to be a compromise, Senate Republicans clearly won some key battles, including on the individual tax brackets, so it۪s at least a little understandable that House Republicans weren۪t as familiar with those details. But that wasn۪t the excuse we got from the lawmakers themselves. House Republicans told us, time and again, that they were very familiar۝ with the details of this legislation. When we suggested they didn۪t have much time to read the final legislation after it was released Friday night, they said they had plenty of time. We۪ve had several weeks! I read it on the plane two weeks in a row!۝ Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.) told HuffPost. But how much should we trust that if, in the next breath, those lawmakers didn۪t know basic facts about the bill? The individual tax brackets aren۪t inconsequential; they just weren۪t what Republicans were truly focused on.If you were to ask any House Republican what the new corporate tax rate will be, they almost certainly would have been able to tell you it۪s 21 percent. If you asked them the top individual rate only, they likely would have been able to tell you it was 37 percent. Many members, in fact, were able to list the top bracket, which, as every member also likely knows, has been lowered from 39.6 percent. The rates in the middle, however, the rates that actually apply to the middle class ۥ the people Republicans kept saying the bill was aimed to help ۥ were not numbers the lawmakers knew. At least not specifically. They didn۪t appear to have studied where individual rates were previously and where they۪re going to be at various income levels ۥ or if they did, they didn۪t study very hard. GOP lawmakers were far more focused on corporate rates and the tax rates on higher incomes that affect them personally. As Roger Williams ۥ who has an estimated worth between $20 million and $70 million ۥ said about the individual tax rate, I know what mine۪s going to be.۝ But Republicans truly want you to believe they know the ins and outs of this legislation. When we asked Rep. Ralph Abraham (R-La.) how familiar Republicans were with this bill, he said Republicans were as well-versed on this tax cut bill as any other bill as we۪ve ever voted on.۝ And then, when we pressed Abraham to name the brackets, he listed 10 percent, 12 percent, 14 percent, 16 percent, 22 percent, 28 percent ... and trailed off. That۪s three right out of seven. You can listen to the interviews of each member we asked here : Kevin Brady (R-Texas) Diane Black (R-Tenn.) Roger Williams (R-Texas) Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) David McKinley (R-W.Va.) Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.) Lynn Jenkins (R-Kan.) Bill Johnson (R-Ohio) Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) Jeff Denham (R-Calif.) Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn.) Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.) Billy Long (R-Mo.) Ralph Abraham (R-La.) Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) And here۪s the successful attempt by Chris Stewart (R-Utah) at naming the brackets."

The statement today was more Kumbaya nonsense,۝ Spencer said, speaking to reporters in his office and part-time home in Alexandria, Virginia. He sounded like a Sunday school teacher. I just don۪t take him seriously ... it sounded so hollow and vapid.۝ Trump۪s statement Monday was technically his most direct denunciation of white supremacy in the wake of violent protests in Charlottesville, Virginia , over the weekend that left three dead and at least 35 injured. But for a president who is quick to tweet against any perceived slight, the statement arrived noticeably late ۥ and only after he faced bipartisan criticism for vaguely condemning violence on many sides.۝ Spencer, who was a prominent attendee at the Charlottesville rally , invited reporters to a news conference Monday to address the incident. He initially tried to host the press event at two hotels in Washington, D.C., but they both canceled his reservation, according to Spencer. (He said he used his real name.) Reporters were instead instructed to go to a street corner in Old Town Alexandria. A man who worked with Spencer and who gave a pseudonym, Reinhard, beckoned reporters upstairs to a makeshift office. The liquor cabinet was stocked with Cutty Sark whiskey and Bombay Dry Gin, the bookcase stacked with The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life , the German philosophy book Nietzsche۪s Teaching:An Interpretation of Thus Spoke Zarathustra , a blow-up doll of what appeared to be Pepe the Frog (a character co-opted by white nationalists) and a Make America great again۝ hat. There was also a We the People۝ diversity poster propped on a windowsill. America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know what۪s going on. Tell us your story . The office appeared to be begging for respectability. At least five Spencer associates, all male, were hanging around the office, some dressed up. (A copy of Dressing the Man: The Art of Permanent Fashion sat on the coffee table.) They included Matt, who claimed to be doing an internship with Spencer but refused to give his last name because he was worried about getting fired from his other jobs. (Spencer said he pays Matt.) Spencer spent most his time criticizing the police response in Charlottesville and sought to distance himself from James Alex Fields Jr., the 20-year-old accused of plowing his car into counter-protesters, killing one person and injuring 19. Spencer did not, however, condemn Fields, instead noting that he was awaiting the outcome of an investigation. Another associate, Nathan Damigo, a white supremacist and Marine veteran who was filmed punching a 95-pound female protester in Berkeley, California, earlier this year, also told HuffPost he was not too worried about Trump۪s statement. Damigo was disappointed۝ in Trump, but the president۪s statements were vague, they were ambiguous, and oftentimes people in his position will talk that way to skirt around difficult issues,۝ he said. When Trump says that he denounces racism, that could mean many different things to different people.۝ When HuffPost asked a third Spencer associate  who said he was 28 but wouldn۪t give his real name, instead calling himself Marcus Aurelius  about Trump۪s statement, he said, Yeah, of course he۪s going to do that.۝ The man added, It۪s the same platitudes over and over. You۪ve heard it once, you۪ve heard it a thousand times.۝ Given Trump۪s relationship with the so-called alt-right ۥ a new word for white nationalism ۥ during the campaign, it۪s not particularly surprising that Monday۪s speech did not resonate with people actually accused of spreading hate. Last year, Trump initially failed to denounce former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke, a Trump supporter, instead saying,  I know nothing about white supremacists. You wouldn۪t want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about.۝ Duke appeared to have a meltdown in response to Trump۪s statement Monday. President Trump, please, for God۪s sake, don۪t feel like you need to say these things,۝ Duke said in a video . It۪s not going to do you any good.۝ But at the news conference, Spencer still referred to White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller and chief strategist Steve Bannon as possible fellow travelers of the alt-right. He also pointed out that the rise of the movement۪s public exposure coincided almost exactly۝ with Trump۪s announcement that he was running for president. Although he has some policy differences with the president, Spencer said, we were connected with Donald Trump on this kind of psychic level.۝ Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hot-dog-vendor-berkeley_us_59b7d145e4b031cc65cc9ae0","Thousands of people have donated more than $50,000 to an online campaign launched this weekend in support of a California hot dog vendor ticketed Saturday by a U.C. Berkeley police officer, who also took money from the man۪s wallet. In a cellphone video, two campus police officers are seen shutting down an alleged unlicensed vending operation outside the university football stadium. Martin Flores, the bystander who recorded the incident, is heard protesting as one of the officers folds up dollar bills he۪s seized from the vendor۪s wallet. That۪s not right,۝ said Flores. That۪s how it works,۝ the officer responds. We۪ll take it to the judge and the judge can decide whether or not it۪s right.۝ This is law and order in action,۝ the officer adds. Walk 200 feet to your left and you۪ll see drinking in public, but a hardworking man gets his money taken away and a ticket,۝ says Flores. Flores۪ initial Facebook post has since been made private, but other social media accounts have posted the video, where it has been viewed tens of millions of times. Flores launched the GoFundMe campaign on Sunday, which claims to be on behalf of the hot dog vendor, since identified as Beto Matias. The fundraiser page says the money will be used to cover Matias۪ legal fees and personal losses, and that additional funds will go to support any other vendorsʉrobbed of their hard earned living through citations and removal of their carts.۝ Flores is working to organize a public event in Los Angeles in the coming weeks, where he plans to present donations to Matias and announce an advocacy campaign for street vendors, he said. We want people to be recognized and for everybody to know how these funds are spent,۝ he said. We want to highlight the issue of street vendors and put humanity into their work and not criminality.۝ Flores said he was surprised by the success of the fundraiser, and now hopes it could grow large enough to help Matias buy a food truck, something that has long been a dream of his. But Flores maintained that Matias۪ confrontation with law enforcement is a reflection of a larger problem. He۪s just one of thousands of people who face challenges, whether it۪s from an officer, or from the public or from the stigma,۝ said Flores. They go through challenges to make a living, but they۪re probably the most humble workers that we have along with the farmworkers.۝ Matias has admitted that he did not have a permit to sell food on campus, but believes the officer went too far by confiscating his cash, which amounted to $60. Some Berkeley students appear to agree with Flores۪ indignation over the incident. A petition calling for the removal of the officer , identified as Sean Aranas, has received tens of thousands of signatures. Zaynab AbdulQadir-Morris, president of the Associated Students of the University of California, has accused Aranas of harassing other people on campus, and plans to bring the issue up with university officials this week, she told the Daily Californian . In a statement Monday, U.C.Berkeley Vice Chancellor Scott Biddy said the university is investigating the incident to examine procedural and management issues۝ it may have raised. Aranas was reportedly acting on orders from a supervisor to issue a citation,۝ according to ABC7 ,though it۪s not clear of he۪d also been told to seize the alleged proceeds. Matias was the only vendor to get slapped with an illegal vending ticket on Saturday, UCPD told Berkeleyside . Three others were detained, but released with warnings. Footage of Matias۪ run-in with the police has also sparked a conversation about a controversial law enforcement tool known as civil asset forfeiture , which allows officers to seize cash and property from suspects, even when they haven۪t been convicted of a crime ۥ and in many cases haven۪t even been charged. If owners want to challenge seizures, they must often fight lengthy and costly legal battles to prove their innocence and reclaim their property before it۪s permanently turned over to police. Critics of the practice claim it is routinely abused, and most commonly targets vulnerable individuals who may not have the means to challenge improper actions.

The president۪s response to the white nationalists۪ rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend has outraged Republicans and Democrats alike. Trump on Tuesday blamed both sides۝ for the deadly violence that unfolded in the city.And he doubled down on his defense of white supremacists who marched through the University of Virginia۪s campus and chanted Nazi slogans including Jews will not replace us.۝ In a joint letter sent to Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump۪s former congregation in New York City Wednesday evening, Rabbi Emeritus Haskel Lookstein and two other rabbis criticized Trump۪s reaction to the Charlottesville events, which resulted in an anti-racist protester being killed by a car. James Alex Fields Jr. , 20, from Ohio,has been charged with offenses including second-degree murder.

The letter continues, While we always avoid politics, we are deeply troubled by the moral equivalency and equivocation President Trump has offered in his response to this act of violence.۝ Trump insisted that the counterprotesters demonstrating against the white supremacists۪ anti-Semitic and racist behavior were also to blame for events that occurred. (Though on Thursday he tried to walk back his earlier comments, claiming he never said there is a moral equivalency between۝ the white supremacists and the anti-fascists protesters.) The president also falsely argued that the counter-protesters did not have a permit, while the white supremacists and neo-Nazis were legally permitted to demonstrate.

Since the blatant displays of anti-Semitism in Charlottesville, critics have demanded to know why Trump did not immediately, unequivocally and repeatedly denounce the neo-Nazis that demonstrated in the city,considering his daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren are Jewish. Critics also want to know why Ivanka Trump has not spoken out more against the anti-Semitic behavior displayed over the weekend. Following Heyer۪s death on Saturday, the first daughter condemned white supremacists more harshly than her father, but she has been silent on the issue since tweeting a message on Sunday. The New York Times reported Tuesday that she and Kushner were on vacation in Vermont.

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-pardons-russia-probe_us_59762032e4b00e4363e1249b","WASHINGTON ۥ There۪s a normal process for your average federal convict seeking a presidential pardon.There are petitions to prepare, letters to solicit, character affidavits to notarize, background checks to be conducted and federal prosecutors to be consulted. The whole process, controlled by the Justice Department۪s Office of the Pardon Attorney , can take years, and there۪s a very slim chance the president will ultimately grant a pardon. However, if your dad is the president and you۪re hoping to head off a potential indictment, you could just ask him to send a tweet. President Donald Trump has, via Twitter, floated the possibility that he۪ll use pardons as a means of shutting down indictments that may grow out of special counsel Robert Mueller۪s investigation into the Trump campaign and Russian interference with the 2016 election.If Trump is learning more about the process, as media reports indicate, he may be surprised by how easy it would be for him to pardon his family members or former campaign aides. Trump pardoning his own family members before they۪ve even been indicted would be virtually unprecedented in the modern era. Former officials in the Office of the Pardon Attorney who spoke with HuffPost this week pointed to President Gerald Ford۪s pardon of former President Richard Nixon after the Watergate scandal as the most relevant pre-indictment presidential pardon in recent U.S. history. Nixon is the most high-profile one, where no charges had even been brought, and I think that would be the most logical analogue,۝ said Margaret Love , who served as U.S. pardon attorney from 1990 to 1997. But constitutionally, experts say, it۪s all aboveboard. The consequences of those pardons would be political , not legal. Normally it would be political suicide to pardon a family member,۝ in the words of Ohio State University law professor Peter Shane. But the normal rules of politics don۪t seem to apply to President Trump. You just have to stand up against the political storm that would result,۝ Love said. Other presidents have pardoned their family members and aides. President Bill Clinton pardoned his half-brother Roger for selling cocaine to an undercover officer, while President George W. Bush commuted the sentence of former White House aide I. Lewis Scooter۝ Libby, sparing him a stint in federal prison. But neither Clinton۪s pardon nor Bush۪s clemency grant came before an indictment. Roger Clinton had already served a year in prison in the 1980s, and Libby۪s commutation came after he was convicted and sentenced to 30 months in prison. While there have been some pre-indictment pardons, those have typically affected entire groups of people, like when President Ronald Reagan granted amnesty for undocumented immigrants or when President Jimmy Carter pardoned hundreds of thousands of draft dodgers. The pardon clause of the Constitution gives the president very wide authority. While the president can seek advice on pardons from any source he wants, the Office of the Pardon Attorney has handled most such cases since 1893. The Office of the Pardon Attorney plays a crucial role in typical cases. One of the major benefits for presidents is that OPA vets all of the pardon applications for the White House, reducing the risk that a pardon could backfire. In the normal case, the White House won۪t touch a case unless it۪s gone through that administrative process at DOJ,۝ says Samuel Morison , a former lawyer in the Office of the Pardon Attorney. It protects them from being embarrassed if it goes through DOJ, and it also gives them some political cover. If there۪s criticism, they can say, well, DOJ told us to do it.۝ Love said that the process at DOJ has served presidents well dating back to the 19th century. It۪s always thought that it۪s protective of the president,۝ she said. The only time the president has gotten into trouble is when he avoids the process.۝ If Trump does decide to preemptively pardon his son Donald Trump Jr., or his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, it۪s highly unlikely their cases would be vetted by the Office of the Pardon Attorney. The cases would more likely be handled entirely by the White House Counsel. If anybody like that who is closely related to Trump wants a pardon, I doubt very much they۪re going to bother filing a pardon application with the Office of the Pardon Attorney,۝ Morison said. I don۪t represent any of those people in a pardon matter, but if I did, I would tell them, Why would you do that? Just go straight to the White House.۪۝ OPA doesn۪t even accept applications from individuals who haven۪t been convicted of a crime, Morison said. There۪d be very little required of Trump if he decided to grant any pardons. The White House could issue a fairly short statement, and the form wouldn۪t really matter, Love said. Trump could do it in a tweet if he wanted, as USA Today wrote in January. (The biggest restriction might be Twitter۪s character limit: The key portion of Ford۪s letter pardoning Nixon ran to 442 characters. If Trump were to write something similar, he۪d need to split it into a few tweets.) The president can do this pretty much in any form he wants, as long as it۪s a public announcement,۝ Love said. The pardon doesn۪t even need to be a written document, she added: Stick your head out the window, yell it out in the street.۝ It just needs to be a matter of record that the pardon was issued. Of course, the really remarkable thing is not that the words Twitter۝ and presidential pardon۝ are being mentioned in the same sentence. It۪s the fact that Trump would consider issuing a preemptive pardon for a member of his family at all. We truly are in uncharted waters here,۝ Love said."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-senators-obamacare-repeal_us_596e1f00e4b010d77673e8e1","WASHINGTON ۥ Less than a day after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the Senate will vote to repeal Obamacare without providing a replacement, his plan is dead. Three Republicans announced Tuesday that they won۪t vote for a procedural step to take up the bill ۥ and that۪s all it takes to kill it. Those senators are Susan Collins (Maine) , Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.) . Sen. Rob Portman (Ohio) also raised concerns about a repeal-only plan increasing uncertainty in the marketplace and leading to higher premiums and deductibles. McConnell has now failed three times in the last month to pass a bill to gut Obamacare, otherwise known as the Affordable Care Act, something Republicans have vowed to do for seven years. The crux of the problem: Moderate Republicans want to keep key pieces of the law in place and aren۪t comfortable throwing millions of people off health care, while conservative Republicans want to throw out the whole law. There۪s not a lot of middle ground. Democrats have been cut out of negotiations entirely. President Donald Trump, who۪s been pressuring Republicans to hurry up and pass a beautiful۝ repeal bill, saw the writing on the wall Tuesday and distanced himself from McConnell۪s mess. Let Obamacare fail,۝ Trump said, per The Associated Press . I۪m not going to own it.۝ Meanwhile, Senate Republicans developed the ability to walk faster than ever before without replying to reporters۪ questions on Tuesday. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), who is in GOP leadership, had no response when asked what happens next if his party can۪t pass the repeal bill. Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) managed to spit out one word: Prayer.۝ Asked what the latest failure to repeal Obamacare says about his party۪s ability to govern, since the GOP controls the government and has been promising to repeal the health care law for years, Roberts said only, Not much.۝ McConnell is still planning to hold the procedural vote on the repeal bill and said on Tuesday evening it would take place early next week,even though he doesn۪t have the votes to move it forward. Such a vote would put Republicans on record on the issue. From there, it۪s unclear what he plans to do next. After months of defeat on Obamacare repeal, McConnell may simply prefer to vote, let it fail, and move on to other agenda items like tax reform or budget matters. We have demonstrated that Republicans, by themselves, are not prepared at this particular point to do a replacement,۝ the GOP leader bluntly conceded to reporters on Tuesday afternoon. Asked how he۪ll justify failing to repeal Obamacare to voters, McConnell replied, Well, we have a new Supreme Court justice,۝ referring to how Republicans denied a Supreme Court seat to President Barack Obama۪s pick, Merrick Garland, all last year in order to let Trump fill the seat this year. Republicans still have ideas for how to get something done on health care. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) wants a vote on his bill to turn all of the estimated $110 billion federal dollars spent on Obamacare into block grants to the states. Murkowski, who seemed liberated after announcing her opposition to the latest GOP proposal, told reporters it۪s time to bring Democrats and Republicans together to fix problems with the health care law. Yes, this is hard,۝ she said. What I think has to happen is the Republicans have to admit that some of the things in the ACA we actually liked and the Democrats have to admit that some things they voted for in the ACA are broken and need to be fixed. And we need to take it up in open committee, offer amendments, try to build a consensus product and do it in a way that the public feels that we are really working towards their interest.۝ Collins echoed Murkowski۪s strategy. What I۪ve recommended is that the [health] committee hold hearings, that we look at doing a bipartisan bill,۝ she told reporters. I think that would be most effective.۝ Democrats wandered the halls, meanwhile, with a little spring in their step. I۪m feeling great,۝ said Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-jerusalem-israel-capital_us_5a21450ce4b0a02abe9065ca","President Donald Trump officially recognized Jerusalem as Israel۪s capital on Wednesday and directed the State Department to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel there from Tel Aviv. The decision marks a controversial shift in U.S. policy that threatens to further inflame Israeli-Palestinian tensions. The move is meant to signalʉthe beginning of a new approach to conflict between Israel and the Palestinians,۝ Trump said Wednesday. We cannot solve our problems by repeating the same failed strategies of the past.۝ He criticized former U.S. presidents for declining to recognize Jerusalem as Israel۪s capital, which he called a long overdue step to advance the peace process.۝ Trump also vowed to help work toward a peace deal that is acceptable to both sides,۝ and said he would support a two-state solution if it was agreed to by both sides. This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality,۝ he said. It is also the right thing to do.۝ There is no immediate timeline for when the relocation will occur. The pending move, which Trump had long offered as a promise to his evangelical voting base and pro-Israel American Jews, has already provoked outrage across the Middle East. Palestinians took to the streets of Gaza City and Rafah, chanting Death to America,۝ Death to Israel۝ and Down with Trump.۝ They burned American and Israeli flags as well as photos of Trump. In response to Trump۪s announcement, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the move and said that the United States is withdrawing from its role as mediator in the peace process. The decision by President Trump will not change the reality of the city of Jerusalem and will not give any legitimacy to the Israelis on this issue,۝ Abbas said. Both Israelis and Palestinians lay claim to Jerusalem,but Israel has controlled the city since 1967. Most United Nations members don۪t recognize Israel۪s sovereignty over East Jerusalem, arguing instead that the city should possess international status. For decades, U.S. policy has stated that Israelis and Palestinians should negotiate the city۪s status among themselves. Since Palestinians also consider Jerusalem their capital, any policy that appears to favor the Israelis۪ claim over the Palestinians۪ is extremely contentious. The status of Jerusalem has therefore long been a key issue in the peace process, and Palestinian officials have said that any change to the city۪s status would be destructive. In 1995, Congress passed a law requiring the American embassy to be relocated to Jerusalem. However, every president since then has signed a national security waiver every six months to delay the move.Trump is still expected to sign the waiver, as the timing of the embassy move remains unclear and the law requires cuts to State Department funding if the deadline lapses. Former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton made similar vows to move the embassy during their presidential campaigns, but both ultimately decided not to pursue the relocation when faced with political realities. Trump signed the waiver to delay the relocation in June. It۪s not clear why he decided to recognize Jerusalem as the capital now, although the administration has signaled for weeks that a change was coming. Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to travel to Israel later this month. Outrage Over The Shift Several nations and international organizations swiftly condemned the move. Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi called it a disaster.۝ The peace process has failed,۝ she said in an interview after Trump۪s speech. Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri also expressed his nation۪s disappointment in a tweet on Wednesday afternoon. French President Emmanuel Macron said the decision was regrettable.۝Macron and several other European leaders had urged Trump to reconsider his shift in policy. Many other world leaders sounded the alarm in the lead-up to Trump۪s announcement as it became evident that he intended to relocate the embassy. Mr. Trump,Jerusalem is the red line of Muslims ,۝ Turkey۪s President Tayyip Erdogan said Monday. He threatened to cut Turkey۪s diplomatic ties with Israel. The Arab League also opposed the move, with Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit saying it was a dangerous measure that would have repercussions.۝ Jordan۪s King Abdullah II warned the Trump administration that an embassy move could derail Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts ۥan issue Trump has delegated to Jared Kushner , his son-in-law and adviser. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had reportedly cautioned that the move could endanger American diplomats and troops stationed in the Middle East and Muslim nations, The Associated Press reported. Demonstrations In anticipation of Trump۪s announcement, Palestinian political factions called for three days of demonstrations against the move and urged widespread protests in city centers and at Israeli embassies. The U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem tweeted on Tuesday that U.S. citizens should avoid areas where crowds have gathered to demonstrate. The statement also issued restrictions on U.S. government employees۪ personal and official travel for certain areas of Israel. The Trump administration has made several changes in policy in an attempt to cast itself as pro-Israel, including pulling out of UNESCO, the United Nations cultural and education agency, after accusing it of anti-Israel bias. But the decision to relocate the embassy is by far the most significant of Trump۪s policy changes on Israel, and one that threatens to have widespread and immediate ramifications. However, it۪s unclear where in Jerusalem the embassy would be, which could present an obstacle to implementing Trump۪s plan. The U.S. has consular offices in Jerusalem, but it۪s unlikely that they would be suitable for a permanent embassy. Moving the embassy could therefore be a process that takes years, requiring immense planning and security considerations as the U.S. looks for a new site to host its diplomatic staff.

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dont-look-now-but-full-obamacare-repeal-is-back-on-the-table_us_59bd9f2de4b086432b07a12a","Repeal of the Affordable Care Act is back on the agenda, with Republicans suddenly talking about a bill that, until recently, few people in either party had taken all that seriously. The prospects for the new legislation are murky . The proposal has generated a ton of conversation in political and health policy circles in just the past week, with multiple outlets reporting that leadership is now thinking about floor action before Sept. 30.That۪s the magic date when, because of parliamentary rules, Republicans lose their ability to pass repeal with just 50 votes. But much of the chatter is hype from supporters and it۪s hard to know how much enthusiasm for the proposal actually exists. Still, even if the bill۪s political fortunes are difficult to pin down, the impact it would have as a law is crystal clear. By dramatically scaling back what the federal government spends on health care and undermining rules designed to guarantee insurance for people with pre-existing conditions, this new proposal would leave millions of Americans struggling to pay their medical bills and to get coverage. It is, in other words, another shot at full repeal, although its GOP sponsors sometimes suggest otherwise ۥ and that۪s one reason it has escaped heavy scrutiny until now. A New Bill With The Same Old Devastating Effects On Coverage Those sponsors are Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina ۥ an unlikely duo, perhaps, given some of their previous statements about repeal. During the spring and summer, Graham repeatedly criticized his party۪s leadership for trying to jam through legislation on a party-line vote, without trying to work with Democrats or going through the usual committee process. Cassidy, for his part, famously urged his colleagues to pass what he dubbed the Jimmy Kimmel test۝ ۥ a reference to the late-night television host۪s impassioned public plea to make sure everybody has access to care, regardless of income or medical condition, after his newborn son was diagnosed with a genetic heart defect. Cassidy۪s grandstanding on access to care seemed to make sense, given that previously he had worked with Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) on a skeletal proposal that he promised would let states keep their versions of Obamacare۝ intact if they so chose. California, New York  you love Obamacare, you can keep it,۝ Cassidy said. But when it came time to vote repeal legislation in late July, there was Graham voting yes, even though leadership had ignored his pleas for regular order, and there was Cassidy right there alongside him, even though the bills would have violated the Kimmel test by depriving millions of coverage. Now the pair is back with a proposal that would (yet again) go straight to a floor vote and would (yet again) mean no coverage for tens of millions. Starting in 2020, the Cassidy-Graham bill would eliminate both the Affordable Care Act۪s subsidies and the enhanced federal funding that underwrites the expansion of Medicaid in 31 states (plus the District of Columbia). The bill would then establish a block grant,۝ handing money directly to the states for helping people to pay for health care. This would produce the best of all worlds , as Cassidy and Graham would say, because it would mean states could stop worrying about the complications of the Affordable Care Act and simply use that money in ways that will work best for them and their citizens. In reality, the Cassidy-Graham would shrink the federal investment in health care programs dramatically, by somewhere in the neighborhood of $400 billion over the next ten years, or maybe even more, according to a preliminary and rough analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities . Starting in 2027, the money would vanish altogether. In theory, Congress could appropriate new money then, a possibility Cassidy and Graham have raised in an effort to soothe those nervous about such a dramatic drop-off in funds. In practice, it would take $200 billion each year just to keep pace. That۪d be a huge ask for any Congress. It۪s true the bill would give states new flexibility ۥ so much flexibility, in fact, that they wouldn۪t have to direct the funding to the low- and middle-income Americans who need the help most. Nor would they have to keep regulations that prohibit insurers from charging higher premiums to people with pre-existing medical conditions , or include benefits like mental health and maternity that carriers frequently excluded in the old, pre-Obamacare days and would almost surely start excluding again if they had the chance. This bill is far more radical [than previous repeal bills] in that it envisions going back to the pre-ACA world, where the federal government wasn۪t in the business of helping low-income adults or moderate-income people without employer coverage get health insurance at all,۝ Aviva Aron-Dine , senior fellow at the center, told HuffPost. Compared to pre-ACA, there would be some extra state grant money floating around ۥ but it would have virtually no requirements attached to it at all and, since the funding wouldn۪t adjust based on enrollment or costs, it would be hard for even well-intentioned states to use it to create an individual entitlement to coverage or help.۝ Oh, and the bill would repeal the Affordable Care Act۪s individual mandate, and do so right away ۥ destabilizing insurance markets and causing premiums to rise right away, according to official projections. Exactly how many people would lose insurance, and what kind of benefits would be left for the people who hold onto coverage, is not clear. The Congressional Budget Office hasn۪t had a chance to evaluate the plan yet, although Cassidy, like most Republicans these days, has already said he۪s willing to ignore CBO altogether because he thinks their analysis is unreliable. (Actually, the CBO predictions of the Affordable Care Act۪s ultimate coverage impact were quite good, even though some specific projections of the type of coverage people would have were way off.) Why Cassidy-Graham Bill Might Not Pass, And Why It Might The substantive impact of the bill and the rushed process Republicans are using to push it make the Cassidy-Graham bill look a lot like the bills that failed to get majority votes back in July, when the Senate took them up. And the politics of repeal would seem to be no more favorable for Republicans than they did then. The 2010 health care law, which has led to a historic decline in the number of people without insurance, has grown steadily, if incrementally, more popular during the repeal debate, according to polling . Clear majorities now prefer either keeping or improving the law, flaws and all, rather than getting rid of it outright. As it happens, in just the past few weeks, a handful of Republican and Democratic senators have taken that instruction to heart. They have been working diligently on a different piece of legislation ۥ a narrowly tailored bill designed to shore up the program in the states where it is struggling and, in the process, find some common ground between the parties. This was just the kind of effort that one Republican in particular, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, had insisted he wanted when he cast a dramatic and decisive vote against the final GOP repeal proposal to come up in late July ۥ and it would seem like he would be loathe to short-circuit this new bipartisan effort, now that it is underway. But McCain is also very close to Graham and at this point nobody knows how he۪ll reconcile personal loyalty and political principle. (So far, McCain has sent out conflicting signals over how he feels about the Cassidy-Graham bill.) Another factor in the bill۪s eventual success or demise could be the way it shifts money among the states. Because of its complex funding formula, states like Alabama and Texas would initially see more funding, while states like California and Connecticut would see dramatic cuts, according to the same Center on Budget and Public Priorities analysis . The partisan tinge to the transformation is presumably intentional, since it۪s mostly a transfer of money from Democratic states to Republican ones ۥ and, perversely, from those states that have tried hardest to expand coverage, by expanding their Medicaid programs and promoting enrollment, to those that have done as little as possible to help their citizens and in some cases worked actively to undermine the Affordable Care Act. But the formula doesn۪t work out perfectly for Republican states, according to the same analysis. By year 10, for example, Alaska, Ohio and West Virginia would all be losing money, and that۪s politically critical since Alaska۪s Lisa Murkowski was one of three Republican senators who voted no on the final repeal bill while the votes of Ohio۪s Rob Portman and West Virginia۪s Shelley Moore Capito were in play until the end, although they both voted yes. Neither Capito, Murkowski, nor Portman have said much about the new bill, nor has Collins, who was the third member of the triumvirate to kill repeal last time. The only Republican senator to indicate a clear position on Cassidy-Graham so far has been Rand Paul , of Kentucky, who has said he۪s a firm no ۥ ironically, if predictably, because it leaves too much of the Affordable Care Act۪s edifice in place. He might stick to that position and vote no, making the GOP vote math impossible unless leaders can somehow flip Murkowski (thought to be highly difficult) or Collins (thought to be impossible). Or he might change his mind. Or other Republicans could come out against the proposal. It۪s difficult to say where this is all going. After all, the idea that repeal could get another look now, despite its unpopularity, in the form of a proposal that in some respects is more radical than its predecessors, is difficult to fathom. And yet here we are, fathoming it."

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lisa-murkowski-health-insurance-mandate_us_5a14e2c4e4b03dec8248f563","Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) cast a decisive, dramatic vote to save health care for millions of people over the summer. The chances of her doing it again just went way down. With Republicans preparing to vote on tax cut legislation next week, Murkowski announced on Tuesday that she would not oppose the bill simply because it includes a provision repealing the Affordable Care Act۪s individual mandate. Murkowski made the announcement in an op-ed for the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner . And she was careful not to promise she۪d vote for the final tax legislation. That legislation would repeal a variety of corporate and personal taxes. But most of the cuts that benefit lower- and middle-income taxpayers are temporary and, once they expire, half of them would actually end up paying higher taxes, according to official estimates . Those numbers could help sink the bill, which is expected to get no Democratic votes and thus needs 50 of the Senate۪s 52 Republicans to vote for it. But Murkowski۪s statement about the mandate leaves open the possibility she۪d be one of the 50. The individual mandate is a requirement that people either obtain insurance or pay a fine to the government. It is among the least popular elements of the Affordable Care Act, but it also serves some important functions ۥ chief among them, giving healthy people financial incentive to sign up for coverage so that insurers can spread the burden of medical bills broadly and hold down premiums. The mandate also plays a critical role in boosting enrollment among low-income people who, absent the requirement, might never check out their options. Once they do, many discover they are eligible for deeply discounted private coverage or for Medicaid, which is basically free to them. In the op-ed, Murkowski said she favored repeal of the mandate because it simply restores to people the freedom to choose. Nothing else about the structure of the ACA would be changed. ... The only difference would be is if you choose to not buy health insurance, the government would not levy a tax on you.۝ She noted that insurance for some Alaskans buying coverage on their own has been far more expensive than they could reasonably afford ۥ and that for those people who decide coverage isn۪t worth the money, the mandate penalty can be steep. All of that is true. But precisely because of those complicated secondary effects ۥ healthy people shirking coverage, low-income people not exploring their options, and so on ۥ the number of people without insurance would rise both in Alaska and across the nation, while premiums would end up even higher than they would have been otherwise. By 2027, absent a mandate, the number of Americans without coverage would rise by 13 million, while premiums would be up an additional 10 percent, according to the most recent assessment by the Congressional Budget Office ۥ although the CBO is currently re-evaluating its model, and Republicans say the agency wildly overestimates the mandate۪s effects. Fear of injecting health care into the tax debate ۥ and losing people like Murkowski, who cast one of three critical votes against a repeal bill in July ۥ was one reason GOP leaders were initially hesitant to add mandate repeal to their tax bill. But they were desperate for money to offset their $1.4 trillion tax cut, and repeal of the mandate frees up about $338 billion, according to CBO, because the federal government would end up spending so much less paying for Medicaid and subsidized insurance. Of course, if Republican critics of the CBO are right and the estimate of lost coverage is way too high, then eliminating the mandate won۪t generate nearly as much revenue, either ۥ meaning the tax cut would leave an even bigger hole in the federal budget."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mitch-mcconnell-trumpcare-legacy_us_5953fd6be4b0da2c7320be69","Democrats are rejoicing. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) delayed this past week۪s planned vote on the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare. But liberals should hold the champagne. McConnell will be back. His entire political career  the meaning of 40 years of professional energy  depends on it. Four years ago, HuffPost reporter Jason Cherkis and I spent several weeks profiling McConnell . We found a man with almost no ideological commitments. McConnell believes in power  specifically his own. He is a tactician, not an intellectual leader. His lodestar isn۪t economist Milton Friedman or James Buchanan . It۪s Niccolo Machiavelli. And despite his reputation in Washington as a brilliant political mind, McConnell isn۪t a very accomplished Machiavellian. He has no great federal legislative achievement to bequeath to future generations (or, at least, biographers). His major work to date is his title. After battling to become Senate majority leader, he now needs to decorate his crown. It doesn۪t particularly matter which jewels he selects, but it will be a very sad crown without any at all. Repealing Obamacare would be a big sparkler. If the dangers of government spending or socialized medicine keep McConnell up at night, his record in Congress doesn۪t show it. The man currently trying to ram through a bill that would make health insurance unaffordable for 22 million more Americans used to shower his home state with federal funding for health care projects as a matter of routine. For decades, McConnell poured federal money into the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, a Cold War-era nuclear power relic that had become technologically obsolete by the 1980s. McConnell۪s maneuvering kept it open, preserving a source of well-paid union jobs in southwestern Kentucky. When the workers came down with severe health problems from toxic exposures at the plant, McConnell responded by giving them free government health care. This isn۪t a secret in Kentucky. He brags about it in campaign ads every election season. He also secured dentistry for poor pregnant women, prenatal counseling programs and initiatives targeting heart disease, all on the federal dime. These were patchwork programs, only available in Kentucky. But no principled opponent of government health care could approve of them. McConnell has taken the same federal-funds-for-me-but-not-for-thee approach to scientific and medical research, flooding the public University of Louisville with research dollars even as he backs nationwide budget deals slashing government investment in medicine. None of these spending efforts are legislative landmarks. The University of Louisville has a shrine to McConnell at its library. The so-called Mitch McConnell Center for Political Leadership is full of photos of him with other famous people. It has a replica of the desk used by 19th century lawmaker Sen. Henry Clay and a placard stating how much McConnell reveres The Great Compromiser from Kentucky. But there is no Interstate Highway System, no GI Bill, no Medicare, no Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reform bill to congratulate McConnell on. McConnell۪s largesse for Kentucky has been pragmatic, what he needed to provide to get into the Senate and stay there. His passion is the accumulation of political power. To what ends that power is to be deployed is a question for whatever coalition backs McConnell ۥ he is their strategist, not their theologian. His first foray into Washington leadership came in the 1998 electoral cycle, when he chaired the National Republican Senatorial Committee. It was a promising year for the GOP. Democrats were defending a host of vulnerable red-state Senate seats ۥ Arkansas, Nevada, Ohio and the Carolinas were all in play ۥ and Republicans thought they had strong odds in Wisconsin, Washington and California. McConnell raised over $37 million in soft money  a record at the time  and blew it. The Republicans didn۪t add a single seat to their majority. In McConnell۪s second election on the job, they lost five seats to Democrats and then ceded their majority in May 2001 when Vermont Sen. Jim Jeffords left the GOP and began caucusing with the Democrats. McConnell۪s grand strategy of blanket obstruction under President Barack Obama couldn۪t stop Obama۪s re-election and ultimately ended with an earthquake in the Republican Party. President Donald Trump was elected on a platform opposed to free trade and tough on banks, obliterating the Republican economic message of the past 40 years. Before Trump, Republicans generally liked free trade. McConnell had one asterisk on his anti-Obama opposition:He actually wanted to help Obama pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal with 11 other nations. Yet even with a sympathetic president and Republican majorities in both the House and Senate, the GOP leadership somehow couldn۪t get it done.The weight of this responsibility falls more heavily on House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) than on McConnell, but it remains an impressive failure for the senator. McConnell did steal a Supreme Court seat for Republicans by simply refusing to consider any Obama nominee ۥ a creative and risky maneuver. Justice Neil Gorsuch is thoroughly conservative and will influence American law for years to come. But that win was the exception, rather than the general pattern, and presidents receive much more credit for court legacies than senators do. McConnell۪s track record is just not that of a brilliant strategist. His reputation for genius rests instead on the ineptitude of his opponents. After The Washington Post۪s devastating June 23 report on the Obama administration۪s mishandling of Russian meddling in the 2016 election, Democrats may finally begin to see that their standard-bearer for eight years had some serious weaknesses in dealing with political opponents. Obama routinely gave in when it wasn۪t necessary ۥ caving to the banks on foreclosure fraud , to Fox News and Breitbart on driving out Shirley Sherrod _ and to Republicans on nearly everything during his first term. At the end of 2012, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) literally threw Obama۪s fiscal cliff۝ proposals on a fire , knowing that the president didn۪t have to make the concessions to McConnell that he planned to offer. Had the fiscal cliff deadline passed, Reid and Obama might have enacted their own bill with whatever they wanted. Instead, Obama dispatched Vice President Joe Biden to hand Republicans a package of conservative goodies so he could call the agreement bipartisan. And McConnell racked up another victory۝ off an opponent۪s own goal. So today۪s health care battle carries greater significance for the Senate majority leader than for anyone else in Congress.McConnell still has no ideological dog in this fight. But he has to prove to his fellow Republicans that their faith in him is correctly placed. And he has to prove to himself that his decades-long power struggle hasn۪t been in vain. He may well lose, but he will not walk away from a fight on which his legacy depends."

"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/graham-cassidy-failure_us_59ca9a35e4b07e9ca11f3d1b","Republican leaders have decided not to vote on Obamacare repeal legislation this week, effectively ending the party۪s latest effort to wipe away the 2010 health care law. When, and whether, they will try again remains to be seen. But at least for the moment, the GOP۪s seven-year crusade to undo the Affordable Care Act lies in shambles ۥ and insurance for the millions of Americans who depend on the law remains intact. The decision to shelve repeal legislation came during a weekly caucus meeting on Capitol Hill, as leaders acknowledged that the the latest proposal, from Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), lacked the support it required to pass. We don۪t have the votes,۝ Cassidy said afterwards. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) had announced her intention to vote against the measure on Monday, joining two of her colleagues, Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.). That left Republicans with just 49 votes, one short of the 50 they needed. And the clock was ticking, because special authority allowing Republicans to pass repeal with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes it takes to overcome a filibuster, ends on Sept.30. We basically ran out of time,۝ said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), a co-sponsor of the repeal bill. As Graham and Cassidy have promoted their bill in the last two weeks, and GOP leaders got behind it, it appeared for a while that repeal legislation, a version of which had come within one vote of passing in July, might finally get through the Senateʉۥ putting it on track for quick approval in the House and then signature by the president. Even on Tuesday, Republicans were vowing not to give up. Many in the party already have their eyes on a new push for repeal, using the same special legislative authority, once they are done working on an upcoming bill to cut taxes. There۪s plenty of fight left in us,۝Graham vowed on Tuesday. We haven۪t given up on trying to change the American health care system,۝ added Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). But the failure of the Graham-Cassidy legislation, following the collapse of the July effort, has made clear that Republicans still do not agree among themselves on how to replace the ACA,and have no policy plans living up to promises ۥ from Trump and other party leaders ۥ that they can deliver better, cheaper health care to more people. The Affordable Care Act has helped millions to get health coverage, bringing the number of people without insurance to historic lows and improving both access to care and financial security. But because people at higher incomes don۪t qualify for the law۪s tax credits, many of them face high premiums and high out-of-pocket costs ۥ in some cases, more than they paid previously and, in the worst instances, more than they can realistically afford. Those higher costs are largely a function of the law۪s new requirements on insurers ۥ to cover everybody, regardless of pre-existing conditions, and to provide comprehensive benefits with each policy. Republicans have decried these effects, but every plan they proposed would have left many millions without insurance and gutted protections for pre-existing conditions. Graham-Cassidy was one such plan. It would have cut Medicaid, replaced the ACA with a less generous state-based program and undermined insurance regulations. By 2026,it would have left an additional 21 million people without insurance, according to an estimate from the University of Southern California-Brookings Institution Schaeffer Initiative for Innovation in Health Policy . The ACA۪s performance varies enormously across the country, with thriving markets in states like California and faltering ones in states like Tennessee . A big reason for the struggles, where they exist, is that insurers are not attracting enough of the younger and healthier consumers they need to balance their books ۥ forcing the carriers to jack up premiums or pull out of markets altogether. But in most parts of the country, markets appeared to be stabilizing until this year, when Trump took office. His administration has slashed funding for advertising and outreach, and mused frequently about allowing the program to collapse. The president has also threatened to cut off a set of payments,currently the subject of a legal dispute, that insurers need to offset some of their costs. In just the last few weeks, a bipartisan effort to shore up the markets ۥ by guaranteeing those insurer payments and giving states some extra flexibility over management of the program ۥ had gotten underway in the Senate Committee on Health,Education,Labor and Pensions (HELP). The chairman, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), called off those talks last week, as GOP leaders prepared for a floor vote on Graham-Cassidy. On Tuesday, Democratic leaders reiterated their interest in restarting those talks. We are ready at this moment to roll up our sleeves and work with our colleagues on bipartisan solutions,۝ said Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.). But having seen repeal die and then come back from the dead several times already, the ACA۪s defenders were also promising not to stand down ۥ and were encouraging their allies to keep up the pressure. We are not out of the woods yet by any means,۝ said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), ranking Democratic member of the Senate HELP committee. And until Trumpcare is finally set aside, we will not stop fighting, because this last version was the worst one yet.۝"

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/collins-tax-vote_us_5a2ac0d1e4b0a290f050378a","WASHINGTON ۥ Before she voted for the Senate version of the Republican tax bill, Sen. Susan Collins saw that Congress would soon be passing separate spending deals, and she had demands. The Maine Republican laid out a series of conditions for her to support the final conference committee۝ version of the tax proposal. Most notably, she wants Congress to pass two separate health care bills first. I am pushing to make sure they are passed and signed into law prior to the conference report coming back on the tax bill so that I would know for certain we۪re going to be able to mitigate the impact of the repeal of the individual mandate,۝ Collins told reporters before the vote last week. The Senate tax bill would repeal the Obamacare requirement that everybody purchase health insurance or pay a fine. Collins was one of three Republicans to vote down attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act earlier this year. She said that while she۪d prefer that the tax legislation not repeal the individual mandate, with those two other pieces of legislation, the effects of that repeal wouldn۪t be so bad. It۪s unclear how the separate health bills would become law before a final tax vote. Though Collins secured support from both President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), neither man controls the House of Representatives. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has suggested he doesn۪t support the Collins demands, saying he wasn۪t a party to her deal with McConnell. And Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), leader of a group of lawmakers called the Republican Study Committee, said the conservative bloc had been promised by GOP leaders that the health bills would not be part of a must-pass spending package this month. Collins wants Congress to pass the so-called Alexander-Murray deal  an agreement worked out between Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) that would provide for Cost Sharing Reductions۝ for Obamacare insurers  and another bill providing $2.25 billion annually for states to offset the high insurance costs of some individuals. Without those measures signed into law, McConnell could just invite Collins to become the one remaining no۝ vote Senate Republicans can afford, since their tax bill passed with 51 votes last Saturday. Collins did influence the actual tax bill. For instance, she insisted that the Senate bill not fully repeal the state and local tax deduction, though the provisions Collins got mirrored House changes and were probably necessary for the bill to ultimately pass Congress anyway. Other senators may also have misplayed the tax bill. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) recently complained about the president۪s newfound openness toward raising the corporate tax rate slightly from the 20 percent rate that GOP leaders insisted was sacred. Rubio had unsuccessfully pushed for increasing the rate to pay for a better child tax credit. And Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said he supported the tax bill partly on condition he۪d be included in negotiations to protect undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children, another policy conservatives don۪t want in a spending deal. It would be difficult for Republican leaders to appease Collins without betraying House conservatives. On Thursday, they went along with a stopgap spending bill under the conditions that there would be no Alexander-Murray provisions in any of the other upcoming measures to fund the government. Ryan and House Republicans could very well pass another short-term appropriations bill in two weeks, have the Senate change the bill  because, after all, McConnell needs Democratic votes to pass that bill in his chamber  and then force Ryan and House Republicans to pass the Senate version or shut down government. But no matter the ultimate conclusion, Collins is already being asked to accept more things on faith than she was supposed to. Earlier in the week, the House Freedom Caucus nearly derailed a vote to begin merging the separate versions of the tax legislation until leaders agreed to decouple۝ the tax bill from the other spending bills, with Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) telling reporters that the final tax bill would now likely come next week, days before Senators vote again on a spending bill. If that۪s the case, Collins will once again be asked to vote for legislation she believes is harmful to Americans with the promise that Congress will mitigate their actions in the future. If Collins objects, any one other Republican senator  with Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) continuing to oppose the bill  could sink the tax legislation. And other senators may hold up the process until Collins receivers firmer commitments. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), for example, could have a problem with McConnell going back on his word. But it should be clear at this point, to Collins and to House conservatives, that someone is going to get hoodwinked. At least one GOP leader is going to have to go back on his word. And it should be clear at this point that these commitments Republicans are making are a lot looser than members of Congress think."
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-paul-manafort_us_59f8a37ce4b046017faf10ab","WASHINGTON ۥ President Donald Trump refused to answer a question Tuesday about whether he would be willing to pardon his disgraced campaign manager, clamming up and indicating he was done talking to the press. Are you going to pardon [Paul] Manafort?۝ asked HuffPost reporter Shirish Dte after Trump had a meeting at the White House with business leaders. Thank you,۝ Trump replied, indicating he was no longer going to take any questions from reporters. Prior to Dte۪s question, Trump had answered a question about phasing in corporate tax rate reductions. On Monday, Manafort and his business associate, along with a former Trump campaign adviser, were indicted in special counsel Robert Mueller۪s investigation into Russia۪s role in the 2016 election. Manafort faces 12 counts, including charges of money laundering and conspiracy. Manafort served as Trump۪s campaign manager for three months, including during the Republican convention. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also declined to rule out pardons for Manafort and his business partner, Rick Gates, during Monday۪s briefing. I haven۪t had any conversations with him about that. I think we should let the process play through before we start looking at those steps,۝ she said. The White House has tried to downplay the indictments, arguing that much (but not all) of the charges against Manafort and Gates dealt with their lobbying work before the campaign. A potentially more problematic indictment is the third one, against George Papadopoulos, who served as a foreign policy adviser. The Papadopoulos charges, dated Oct. 5 but only unsealed on Monday, deal directly with his work during the election and his attempt to link up the Russian government with the Trump campaign. His statements also make clear that he was acting with the involvement of higher-ranking officials in Trump۪s orbit. He has also been cooperating with investigators for months. Speculation about whether Trump will pardon his associates ۥ and possibly fire Mueller in order to get the investigation to stop ۥ has picked up in recent days. In The Wall Street Journal, for example, two conservative lawyer urged Trump to issue a blanket pardon , saying the Russia matter should not be taken up by a special counsel: Mr. Mueller۪s investigation has been widely interpreted as partisan from the start. Mr. Trump۪s opponents instantaneously started talking of impeachmentnever mind that a special counsel, unlike an independent counsel, has no authority to release a report to Congress or the public. Mr. Trump۪s supporters count the number of Democratic donors on the special-counsel staff. The Mueller investigation is fostering tremendous bitterness among Trump voters, who see it as an effort by Washington mandarins to nullify their votes. Mr. Trump can end this madness by immediately issuing a blanket presidential pardon to anyone involved in supposed collusion with Russia or Russians during the 2016 presidential campaign, to anyone involved with Russian acquisition of an American uranium company during the Obama administration, and to anyone for any offense that has been investigated by Mr. Mueller۪s office. Political weaponization of criminal law should give way to a politically accountable democratic process. Nefarious Russian activities, including possible interference in U.S. elections, can and should be investigated by Congress. Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Pocahontas,۝ during an event honoring Native Americans Monday at the White House. Trump was recognizing Native American Code Talkers who served during World War II when he made the remark about Warren. _You were here long before any of us were here,۝ Trump told Code Talkers during the event . Although we have a representative in Congress who they say was here a long time ago. They call her Pocahontas.۝  Native American Code Talkers were largely Navajo Marines who transmitted commands over the radio to soldiers overseas in their native language during World War II , after both sides became more adept at decoding encrypted messages. Native American code became more reliable than Morse code in the war, notably aiding U.S. efforts in the Battle of Iwo Jima. Trump made his comments Monday while standing in front of a portrait of Andrew Jackson, the former president who signed the Indian Removal Act of 1830 that resulted in the tragic Trail of Tears. Thousands of Native Americans died of cold, starvation and disease during the harrowing trek to the undeveloped Western territories. Warren responded on MSNBC shortly after Trump made the comments. This was supposed to be an event to honor heroes, people who put it all on the line for our country, and people who because of their incredible work saved the lives of countless Americans and our allies,۝ Warren told host Ali Veshi. It is deeply unfortunate that the president of the United States cannot even make it through a ceremony honoring these heroes without having to throw out a racial slur, but Donald Trump does this over and over thinking somehow he۪s going to shut me up with it,۝ Warren continued. It hasn۪t worked in the past. It is not going to work in the future.۝ The National Congress of American Indians asked Trump on Monday to refrain from using her name in a way that denigrates her legacy.۝ Trump has used Pocahontas۪ name to refer to Warren on multiple occasions, including in a tweet earlier this month . Ed Markey, the junior senator from Massachusetts,also referred to the remarks as a slur. Markey tweeted a statement Monday in defense of Warren just after Trump made his joke. What @realDonaldTrump said about my partner @SenWarren is a slur,۝the Democrat wrote. It disparages the Native American war heroes, standing right beside the President, who risked their lives to protect his right to make such a disgusting comment.۝ White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders addressed the president۪s comment during a press briefing Monday. Sanders said Warren۪s condemnation of the Pocahontas۝ comment as a racial slur was a ridiculous response.۝ I think what most people find offensive is Senator Warren lying about her heritage to advance her career,۝ Sanders told reporters . Trump began using the term for the senator because during Warren۪s 2012 Senate race she made unverified claims that she had Native American heritage Former Marine Michael Smith , whose father, Samuel Jesse۝ Smith Sr., was a WWII code talker,said he was disappointed by the president۪s remarks during a rare White House recognition of the Navajo veterans. Smith۪s father served in the 4th Marine Division and fought in the battles of Roi-Namur, Saipan, Tinian and Iwo Jima. Smith, who watched video of the ceremony, told HuffPost that he felt the event began on a positive note but that it had been eclipsed by the incident. Before Trump۪s speech,Peter MacDonald, president of the Navajo Code Talkers Association, recognized the importance of the group during WWII and called for a national museum to honor the code talkers. Isn۪t that unfortunate that the legacy of these men can۪t be paramount over the statement ۥ a derogatory statement, I felt ۥ that Mr. Trump made about a senator,۝ Smith told HuffPost. Appearances by the code talkers are rare due to their age and an association bylaw that asks code talkers to disassociate themselves from politics, Smith says. I thought the whole press conference was going well up to that point. And it۪s unfortunate that he۪s so focused on attacking this person [rather] than honoring these men,۝ Smith told HuffPost. Jefferson Keel, president of The National Congress of American Indians, agreed with Smith, responding in a statement Monday: We regret that the President۪s use of the name Pocahontas as a slur to insult a political adversary is overshadowing the true purpose of today۪s White House ceremony,۝ stated NCAI President Jefferson Keel, a decorated U.S. Army officer and Vietnam War combat veteran. Today was about recognizing the remarkable courage and invaluable contributions of our Native code talkers. That۪s who we honor today and everyday ۥ the three code talkers present at the White House representing the 10 other elderly living code talkers who were unable to join them, and the hundreds of other code talkers from the Cherokee, Choctaw, Comanche, Lakota, Meskwaki, Mohawk, Navajo, Tlingit, and other tribes who served during World Wars I and II. We also honor the service and bravery of all of our veterans and those currently serving from Indian Country. Native people serve in the Armed Forces at a higher rate than any other group in the country, and have served in every war in this nation۪s history. And we honor the contributions of Pocahontas, a hero to her people, the Pamunkey Indian Tribe in Virginia, who reached across uncertain boundaries and brought people together. Once again, we call upon the President to refrain from using her name in a way that denigrates her legacy. This story has been updated with a response from The National Congress of American Indians."
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-executive-order-obamacare_us_59de1dbde4b01df09b77ad19","President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an order that could rattle the Affordable Care Act ۪s private insurance markets by allowing a proliferation of cheaper, less comprehensive plans that would undermine rules about who and what insurers must cover. The changes represent a step toward repeal of Obamacare, something Trump and Republicans have unsuccessfully attempted to do through legislation.ʉWe۪re starting that process,۝ Trump said at a signing ceremony in the Oval Office, adding that he still expects legislation to pass at some point. Today is only the beginning.۝ The order will primarily affect small businesses and people who buy private coverage on their own, rather than through employers. It could lead the kind of transformation that, according to experts, GOP repeal bills would unleash if one of them were to become law. In particular, the new, less regulated insurance plans could provide an attractive alternative to consumers who don۪t expect to have large medical bills and who are frustrated with the high premiums they pay for policies today. At the same time, comprehensive coverage could become harder and eventually even impossible to find, especially for people with pre-existing conditions. For the moment, it۪s difficult to say just how far-reaching Thursday۪s action will be or when all of the changes would take place. The order,as first reported by The Hill and The Wall Street Journal , calls for writing new regulations. Some of those could test the boundaries of executive authority, prompting legal challenges that could drag on in the courts for years. But some parts of the order are likely to take effect more quickly. Perhaps the most consequential of those is a decision to end a rule that limited short-term insurance plans to no more than three months. Many insurers, including at least one large national carrier , already offer these plans, which are not subject to most of the Affordable Care Act۪s rules. The plans don۪t have to include mental health coverage, maternity care, full prescription coverage or other benefits the ACA deems essential. The insurers selling them are free to charge higher prices or deny coverage altogether to people with pre-existing conditions. The three-month limit came from the Obama administration, which worried the short-term plans would draw away consumers in relatively good health, causing state insurance markets to split in two. Taken together, the actions that Trump۪s Thursday order envisions could have precisely that result. Opening The Door To Cheap, Skimpy Insurance Plans On one side of the split would be those short-term policies as well as special  association ۝ plans available to small businesses and, in some cases, individuals. Those association plans exist today but must abide by a variety of state and federal regulations. Trump۪s order would effectively lift some of those restrictions so that, among other things, they could exclude some of the ACA۪s essential benefits. (The order will not specify whether individuals can enroll in the newly deregulated plans, according to the Journal; the Labor Department will have to make that decision when it writes the new rules.) Because they wouldn۪t cover as much and be less available to people with the highest medical bills, the policies in this part of the insurance market would be cheaper and likely popular with people in relatively good health. This is one of the big selling points that Trump and Republicans like Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who worked with the administration to craft its proposal, keep emphasizing: the possibility of giving consumers new and cheaper ways to get insurance. Today is a big day,۝ Paul said at the White House ceremony. But the other side of the insurance market, with the plans that continue to meet the Affordable Care Act۪s standards, could be in trouble. These plans would have all the essential benefits and be available, at uniform prices, to everybody regardless of pre-existing conditions. The insurers operating these plans would have to raise prices, because they would be losing healthy consumers whose premiums pay the bills of people with serious medical conditions. Most people who buy coverage through HealthCare.gov or one of the state-run exchanges would not feel the effects right away, because they qualify for tax credits that insulate them from premium spikes. But if the migration into the less regulated plans was severe, some insurers would give up and abandon markets altogether, quite possibly leaving even the subsidized consumers, including the healthy ones, with no source of comprehensive coverage. A key variable in how Trump۪s order plays out is the future the Affordable Care Act۪s individual mandate,which imposes a financial penalty on people who do not obtain insurance.The mandate is unpopular with the public generally and positively toxic among some conservatives, but experts and insurers say it۪s an essential piece of the Affordable Care Act۪s architecture because it encourages relatively healthy people to enroll. The Trump administration has already indicated it will look for ways to weaken that penalty. If it decides, for example, that people who buy the temporary insurance plans will not face the penalty ۥ an option the Obama administration specifically rejected ۥ that could make those policies a lot more popular, putting new pressure on insurers to raise prices or drop plans. All of this should sound familiar because it۪s what pretty much every reliable authority , including scholars at the Brookings Institution and the trade group representing America۪s health insurance industry, have repeatedly warned would happen if GOP repeal legislation were to become law. Just how much of the repeal agenda Trump can now achieve on his own will depend on a few things: the details of the regulations that the agencies end up writing, the pressure they feel from members of Congress and other interest groups as they go through that process, the fate of the inevitable legal challenges, and the actions of state officials who would retain at least some power to regulate insurance on their own. The public۪s reaction could make a huge difference, as well, though it remains to be seen whether the arcane, drawn-out process of writing regulations will generate the same kind of backlash that GOP legislative efforts to pass a repeal bill have had. Creating Conditions For An Insurance Market Collapse Trump, Paul, and other Republicans who support the executive order have said it is necessary because the Affordable Care Act is failing.۝ Insurers are jacking up premiums even more for next year, they note, and large swathes of the country already have just one insurer. In states like Iowa and Tennessee , the newly reformed private insurance markets have teetered on the edge of collapse. Even the Affordable Care Act۪s staunchest defenders concede that the new insurance markets have struggled in some states ۥ and that, particularly for people who don۪t qualify for the law۪s tax credits, coverage has gotten too expensive. But particularly in states like California and Michigan , where officials have committed themselves to the program۪s success, the markets have worked well. Except in isolated rural pockets, consumers still have plenty of choices and prices are comparable to, if not better than, equivalent employer coverage. And as of the beginning of this year, markets even in struggling states seemed to be stabilizing , with insurers reducing losses or posting profits as they finally figured out how to design and price their markets properly. Now, markets in some of those states are suddenly looking shaky again, but officials and insurers have said that۪s to a large extent because of actions the Trump administration has taken, like threatening to cut off key funds for insurers, slashing the outreach and advertising budget for the Affordable Care Act, and weakening the individual mandate. With Thursday۪s executive order, Trump could push the whole system even closer to collapse ."

Trump said that he and Putin discussed various things۝ during their hours-long sit-down, originally only scheduled for 30 minutes. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also attended the meeting along with two translators.  The lengthy discussion was on par with Putin۪s long first sit-downs with the past two U.S. presidents. The meeting was so long, Tillerson said Trump۪s wife, Melania, was sent in to encourage them to conclude the conversation. They continued to talk for almost another hour after she made her appearance. Tillerson said the two discussed Russian interference in the U.S. election, and that Putin denied any involvement while asking the U.S. for evidence that hacking had taken place. Russian state media reports Putin and Trump also discussed Syria, Ukraine, counterterrorism and cybersecurity, according to CNN۪s Jim Acosta . Tillerson said he thought it was positive۝ that there was not a lot of relitigating of the past۝ during the meeting. I think both of the leaders feel like there۪s a lot of things in the past that both of us are unhappy about,۝ Tillerson told reporters after the meeting.

The meeting comes amid investigations into whether Trump۪s campaign team actively colluded with Russian officials to sway the outcome of the 2016 presidential race. (Trump and his team deny any such collusion.) U.S. intelligence agencies have already determined that Russia did interfere in the election, and that Putin was directly involved in those efforts. Despite this, Trump has repeatedly downplayed Russia۪s actions, and on Thursday declined to say if he۪d broach the subject during his meeting with Putin. Nobody really knows for sure,۝ Trump said of whether Russia was guilty of intervening in the race. Asked about Trump۪s comments, a Kremlin spokesman touted that the president had stressed the possibility that it could have been other countries.۝ The FBI is investigating key figures in Trump۪s orbit, including the president۪s former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Flynn was fired from his post in the administration after it was revealed he discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with Kislyak, and later lied about doing so. Other Trump associates under FBI scrutiny include former campaign manager Paul Manafort, former political adviser Roger Stone, former foreign policy adviser Carter Page and Trump۪s son-in-law Jared Kushner (who is now a senior White House adviser). While Trump has previously referenced past meetings with Putin , he said in July 2016 he has never met the Russian leader. I never met Putin,۝ he said during a news conference.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steve-bannon-obamacare_us_59e38e26e4b03a7be5815bd2","President Donald Trump ended payments to health insurance companies serving the poorest Obamacare customers in order to deliberately destroy the health care law, former chief White House strategist Steve Bannon said. Not gonna make the CSR [cost-sharing reduction] payments. Gonna blow that thing up, gonna blow those [insurance] exchanges up, right?۝ Steve Bannon, the executive chairman of the website Breitbart News, said Saturday in a speech at the Values Voter Summit, a conservative convention in Washington, D.C. The White House announced Thursday that Trump would halt the cost-sharing payments, creating further instability in the health insurance exchanges set up under Obamacare. Almost 6 million low-income Americans qualified for the subsidy when they enrolled this year in the program, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Trump defended his decision to end the subsidies, claiming they were a windfall۝ to insurance companies. Several top Republicans disputed the president۪s characterization of the cost-sharing subsidies on the Sunday news talk shows. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), one of three GOP senators who voted against repealing Obamacare earlier this year, said Trump۪s decision to end the payments is affecting the ability of vulnerable people to receive health care right now.۝ This is not a bailout of the insurers,۝ she said on CNN۪s State of the Union.۝ What this money is used for is to help low-income people afford their deductibles and their co-pays so that their health care is available to them.۝ Asked whether Trump۪s decision hurt ordinary Americans, Collins said, I do believe that.۝ If they can۪t afford their deductibles, then their insurance is pretty much useless,۝ Collins added.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tim-murphy-toxic-office_us_59e0b4c9e4b0a52aca173676","WASHINGTON ۥ Constant tension. Occasional screaming. Unreasonable hours. Impossible expectations. Hardly any way out. Current and former members of Pennsylvania Rep. Tim Murphy۪s staff described a congressional office with a toxic atmosphere, one where Murphy and longtime chief of staff Susan Mosychuk terrorized underlings and devised ways to prevent them from leaving. Murphy has resigned from Congress ۥ effective Oct. 21 ۥ ostensibly for asking his mistress, Shannon Edwards, to get an abortion . Murphy, ever the good Republican, says he۪s anti-abortion. But, as Politico reported last week, part of the reason the eight-term representative is abruptly leaving office is over how badly he treated his staff. If that۪s the case, some former employees suggested Mosychuk should leave, too. I don۪t think she۪ll be allowed to stay,۝ one former Murphy staffer told HuffPost, but I think the greatest tragedy of this whole situation is he۪s taking the brunt of the blame for this.۝ He۪s not the first member to cheat on his wife,۝ this former aide continued, but Susan was the one who created this situation.۝ Accounts differed on how bad Murphy۪s office was for staff. The current legislative director, Christopher Schell ۥ whose mistreatment at the hands of Murphy was detailed by Mosychuk in a June memo ۥ suggested that recent news reports of the abuse didn۪t reflect his experience. But the consensus from former aides who talked to HuffPost on the condition of anonymity was that their time working for Murphy was so bad it left them mentally scarred. I can۪t emphasize enough how scary it was to be in that office, because that office is the most terrifying place,۝ another ex-staffer said. The Politico story detailing some of the abuse Mosychuk dished out to staff said she would call aides worthless,۝ their work garbage.۝ Murphy could also lose his temper. The Congressman would dress you down if you didn۪t spell out an acronym,۝ one former staffer told HuffPost. But the abuse from Mosychuk and Murphy was also more subtle than the occasional outburst or demeaning comment. The office found ways to mistreat staff within the House rules ۥ long hours (even during recess), expectations that employees almost always be at their desks, directives that aides not check personal email or use messaging apps like Gchat. Murphy also required extraordinary preparation for even the most routine meetings. He couldn۪t open a door without a memo,۝ one former staffer said, adding that it wasn۪t uncommon to get multiple emails on a Sunday , within minutes of each other, with multiple Urgent۝ messages in a subject line when the email wasn۪t urgent at all. The former aide showed HuffPost screenshots of this behavior. Perhaps the worst example of the office perverting House rules ۥ while still operating within the letter of the law ۥ was how Murphy and Mosychuk used the student loan repayment program to strong-arm employees into staying in a poisonous work environment. The program, meant to benefit House staffers, repays up to $833 a month to federal student loan providers for employees who agree to stay in their jobs for at least a year. If they quit early, an office can demand repayment. The operate word there is can.۝ In practice, offices very rarely ask employees who don۪t finish a full year to pay back the money. The member has the option to waive this repayment at his/her discretion,۝ a House overview of the program states. But in Murphy۪s office, it was well known that anyone who left before a full 12 months would have to reimburse the House. Mosychuk actively encouraged staff to sign up for the program, aides said, and employees would either have to stay for a year, or find a way to pay back the money. Plenty of staff chose the latter. Turnover in Murphy۪s office was unusually high. In the memo that Mosychuk wrote to Murphy in June, she says staff turnover was nearly 100 percent in one year , and that the office had lost more than 100 employees since she started in 2003. Mosychuk herself paints Murphy as volatile and impossible to please in that memo. She describes the episode involving Murphy۪s new legislative director, or LD, in a way that suggests the Congressman, who claims to be a practicing psychologist , acted like a child. You were storming around as we walked in, as we sat down for prep  having just arrived literally moments ago  you started in on the LD and verbally abused him, harassed him, chastised him and criticized all his work products. You called many of the work products that he literally gave up his weekend to produce as useless.۪ You pushed other documents off the table onto the floor because they weren۪t what you wanted. Then you got angry and demanded we find the documents that you had just thrown on the ground. All the staff were scared of you. Mosychuk also says the memo۪s purpose was to formally۝ inform Murphy of the office۪s vulnerability to yet more legal action as a result of your behavior.۝ But two former staff members said they thought it was a CYA۝ memo (cover your ass,۝ if we۪re spelling out acronyms). Staffers said they were aware of rumors of a sexual relationship between Murphy and Mosychuk. According to former employees, one ex-aide once saw Mosychuk sitting on Murphy۪s lap. Murphy۪s former district director, Nick Rodondo, told a local radio station that he saw Mosychuk and Murphy feed each other. And, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette , Murphy wrote an email to his mistress admitting he fell into۝ a relationship with a woman named Susan.۝ I did not see its toxicity until I was months into it,۝ Murphy wrote to Edwards, the woman with whom he had an affair. Mosychuk also claims in her memo that Murphy had blocked me on your cellphone,۝ and said the Congressman had inaccurately stated that I am blackmailing you.۝ One current staffer said that may refer to potentially reporting Murphy۪s volatile behavior. But former aides, who still stay in touch on group text message threads, have conjectured that the blackmail۝ referred to Murphy۪s relationship with Mosychuk. One former employee said Murphy allowed Mosychuck۪s abuse of staff because he was either in love with her, or she was blackmailing him, and we all thought it was B.۪۝ While no one on staff dared broach the matter with their bosses, that was a courtesy of privacy that employees themselves did not enjoy. Computer screens were positioned so that Mosychuk could make sure staffers were working at all times. She read their emails. She even wanted to know when they were going to the bathroom. Quite literally she told us to ask permission to go to the restroom and justified it by accusing us of not being competent enough to leave during times that weren۪t busy,۝ one ex-staffer said. Constant comments like that made us feel stupid and guilty.۝ If Mosychuk did find you away from your desk, she would email you with some trumped up emergency,۝ according to this former employee, and would make you return to the office as soon as possible, where she would berate you for neglecting۝ your job duties. It was like a prison,۝ the staffer said. There does seem to be some dispute over how bad the office is now. With such a high turnover, there are different generations of Murphy staffers ۥ and some generations seem worse than others. In an earlier era, employees were expected to be at the office around 8:30 a.m. ۥ even when the House was in recess ۥ and they rarely left before 7 p.m. Current staff now sometimes leave by 6 p.m. when lawmakers are out of town. It۪s not unusual for us to close at 5:30 on a Friday ,۝ one current staffer said, braggingly. Ex-staff also remember Mosychuk being stricter about staying at their desks. Two former employees said it used to be so bad that aides would try to distract Mosychuk so that workers could meet with other chiefs of staff for a quick job interview over coffee. Now the rules seem to have loosened, even if, as one aide put it, there۪s still a general sentiment that you should be at your desk as much as possible.۝ The current feeling is employees should probably bring lunch back to their desks, but if someone ate a sandwich in the cafeteria, this aide said, no one۪s going to get pilloried for that.۝ One aspect common among all generations of Murphy staffers was the feeling they had no one to turn to. Technically, there is an Office of Compliance, where House staffers can report mistreatment. But the sense among aides was that, if they reported an issue, it would immediately get back to Murphy and Mosychuk. Everybody is terrified to report something,۝ one former aide said, because whether you۪re on the Hill or off the Hill, there۪s a consequence.۝ I had heard from former staffers that the only way to stop this was to go after [Murphy],۝ the aide continued, which I didn۪t want to do.۝ Staffers were mostly just trying to find jobs elsewhere, they said, and they knew if it got back to Murphy and Mosychuk that they had reported an incident, their bosses could effectively blackball۝ them with other congressional offices. (The office employee handbook makes clear that email can be screened: Employees should not harbor any expectation of privacy in documents created on the equipment provided to them by the Office, including email.۝) The only HR in Congress are the bills,۝ another former aide said. There was nowhere to go. Talking to Ethics or [the Office of] Compliance would involve Susan. She had the ability to keep her job security, you did not.۝ Some Murphy staffers said that Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who was close to Murphy, had to have known Murphy mistreated his staff. There is no way he didn۪t,۝ one staffer said. Ryan۪s office, however, said otherwise. The speaker was not aware of this,۝ AshLee Strong, Ryan۪s press secretary, told HuffPost. Still, it۪s fair to ask why Ryan didn۪t know. How is it that an office with such high staff turnover did not raise flags for congressional leadership? Why is it that staff seemed to be so scared of reporting issues to the Office of Compliance? And what will congressional leaders do now about Mosychuk۪s continued presence in the office, even after Murphy۪s resignation and the news reports about her mistreatment of staff? A request for comment from Murphy went unreturned. And when HuffPost confronted Mosychuk earlier this week in the Murphy office, she had nothing to say.

Mr. President, let me tell you what a curse on the American people is, and that is your support for legislation that would throw 23 million people off the health care they currently have, and then provide huge tax breaks for the rich and large corporations.۝ Providing health care to every man, woman, and child in this country ۥ that۪s not a curse.

Sanders also called Trump the most destructive president۝ in modern history regarding his decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. A decision that puts around 800,000 immigrant youth at risk of deportation. But Sanders also held out hope that the president would realize the mistake he made, as Trump was possibly seeking a deal with Democrats on protecting dreamers.۝ Of all of the terrible things that he has done and proposes to do, the cruelest and most ugly action was the doing away with the legal status of 800,000 young people under the DACA program,۝ the senator said.

According to Republican National Committee Chair Ronna Romney, only one of them should be criticized for sexually harassing women, and it۪s not the president. Other than that key point,Romney struggled mightily to differentiate between the two men in an interview with CNN Monday, despite proclaiming they۪re not even comparable.۝ Weinstein, a Hollywood film executive, was fired Sunday after The New York Times published an article detailing that he had engaged in several decades۪ worth of sexual harassment, including offering to advance actresses۪ careers in exchange for sex. In the interview Monday, Romney noted that Weinstein, unlike Trump, admitted his guilt. That admission happened only after the rest of the world found out about it: Weinstein reportedly reached settlements with at least eight women in a bid to keep his misdeeds quiet. At least 11 women have accused Trump of unwanted sexual advances. During the 2016 election cycle, Trump promised to sue them for lying, yet a USA Today analysis shows Trump often publicly threatens lawsuits but rarely follows through and, like Weinstein, often settles privately. In addition to the women who came forward during the campaign, Trump is dogged by numerous other lascivious accusations, including the infamous Access Hollywood۝ video in which he brags, on tape, about forcing himself on women because when you۪re a star, they let you do it.۝ Trump also reportedly walked in on contestants as young as 15 at the Miss Teen USA beauty pageant while they were getting dressed.

During a public protest, a woman climbed the statue and tied a rope around it about 7 p.m. local time, according to Derrick Lewis, a reporter at the CBS affiliate in Durham . The crowd then pulled the rope and the statue fell. That woman, identified as Takiya Thompson, was arrested Tuesday in connection with taking down the statue. No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA!۝ the protesters were heard chanting as the statue was pulled down to the ground. Some demonstrators then kicked or punched the fallen statue. The monument stood in front of the Old Durham County Courthouse for decades, having been dedicated in 1924, according to a website maintained by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill that documents Southern history. The monument, about 15 feet in height, depicts an armed and uniformed soldier.

A Confederate monument was at the center of weekend protests that turned deadly in Charlottesville. White supremacists descended on the Virginia city over the weekend to protest the city۪s removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. The protest exploded into violence and death on Saturday when a car plowed into a crowd of counter-protesters , killing one and injuring at least 19 others. A 20-year-old white supremacist, James Alex Fields Jr., has been charged with second-degree murder in the incident. Earlier this year, New Orleans removed four prominent Confederate statues, but the incident in Charlottesville has led to numerous state leaders calling for the removal of their own monuments . Acts of protest sprung up in other cities across the country Monday night. Hundreds gathered for no hate۝ rallies in Minneapolis and Washington, D.C., where protesters could be heard chanting,ʉThis is what democracy looks like.۝ Outside Trump Tower in New York , thousands of protesters displayed their scorn for the president with slogans like No Trump, no KKK۝ and New York hates you.۝ Yet in Boston, a 17-year-old allegedly threw a rock through one of the New England Holocaust Memorial۪s glass windows.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-justice-department-pushes-for-citizenship-question-on-census-alarming-experts_us_5a46fc79e4b0b0e5a7a68d3d","The Justice Department is pushing for a question on citizenship to be added to the 2020 census, a move that observers say could depress participation by immigrants who fear that the government could use the information against them. That, in turn, could have potentially large ripple effects for everything the once-a-decade census determines  from how congressional seats are distributed around the country to where hundreds of billions of federal dollars are spent. The DOJ made the request in a previously unreported letter , dated Dec. 12 and obtained by ProPublica, from DOJ official Arthur Gary to the top official at the Census Bureau, which is part of the Commerce Department. The letter argues that the DOJ needs better citizenship data to better enforce the Voting Rights Act and its important protections against racial discrimination in voting.۝ A Census Bureau spokesperson confirmed the agency received the letter and said the request will go through the well-established process that any potential question would go through.۝ The DOJ declined to comment and the White House did not respond to a request for comment. Observers said they feared adding a citizenship question would not only lower response rates, but also make the census more expensive and throw a wrench into the system with just two years to go before the 2020 count. Questions are usually carefully field-tested, a process that can take years. This is a recipe for sabotaging the census,۝ said Arturo Vargas , a member of the National Advisory Committee of the Census and the executive director of NALEO Educational Fund, a Latino advocacy group. When you start adding last-minute questions that are not tested  how will the public understand the question? How much will it suppress response rates?۝ The 2010 census included a handful of questions covering age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, household relationship and owner/renter status  but not citizenship. People are not going to come out to be counted because they۪re going to be fearful the information would be used for negative purposes,۝ said Steve Jost , a former top bureau official during the 2010 census. This line about enforcing voting rights is a new and scary twist.۝ He noted that since the first census in 1790, the goal has been to count everyone in the country, not just citizens. There have been rumblings since the beginning of the year that the Trump administration wanted to add a citizenship question to the census. Adding to the concerns about the 2020 count, Politico reported last month that the administration may appoint to a top job at the bureau a Republican redistricting expert who wrote a book called Redistricting and Representation: Why Competitive Elections Are Bad for America.۝ The Census Bureau۪s population count determines how the 435 U.S. House seats are distributed. The law governing the census gives the commerce secretary, currently Wilbur Ross, the power to decide on questions. They must be submitted to Congress for review two years before the census, in this case by April 2018. A census spokesperson said the agency will also release the questions publicly at that time. A recent Census Bureau presentation shows that the political climate is already having an effect on responsiveness to the bureau۪s American Community Survey , which asks a more extensive list of questions, including on citizenship status, to about one in 38 households in the country per year. In one case, census interviewers reported, a respondent walked out and left interviewer alone in home during citizenship questions.۝ Three years ago, [it] was so much easier to get respondents compared to now because of the government changes _ and trust factors. _ Three years ago I didn۪t have problems with the immigration questions,۝ said another census interviewer. The Justice Department letter argues that including a citizenship question on the once-a-decade census would allow the agency to better enforce Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which bars the dilution of voting power of a minority group through redistricting. To fully enforce those requirements, the Department needs a reliable calculation of the citizen voting-age population in localities where voting rights violations are alleged or suspected,۝ the letter states. The letter asks that the Census Bureau reinstate۝ the question. The census, however, hasn۪t included questions about citizenship since the early 19th century. The Census Bureau has gathered such data in other surveys. The bureau switched the method of those surveys after the 2000 census. Today, it conducts the American Community Survey every year, which includes questions about citizenship, along with many other questions. The survey covers a sample of residents of the United States. Experts said the Justice Department۪s letter was misleading. And they questioned the Justice Department۪s explanation in the letter, noting that the American Community Survey produces data on citizenship that has been used in Section 2 cases. You could always have better data but it seems like a strange concern because no one in the communities who are most affected have been raising this concern,۝ said Michael Li, senior counsel at the Brennan Center۪s Democracy Program.

U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said at Manafort۪s second court hearing on Thursday that she was concerned that he posed a flight risk. In a court filing on Saturday, Manafort۪s lawyers assured the judge that the reason he had three passports was mundane۝: He has a primary passport, a second passport to submit with visa applications to certain foreign countries, and a third that he applied for after he lost his primary passport, which he later found. Manafort۪s frequent flyer status,۝ lawyer Kevin Downing wrote , should not be over-emphasized to show a potential risk of flight when a person۪s job requires extensive travel.۝ He said that Manafort was just a successful domestic and international political consultant۝ who traveled frequently and represented businessmen, political parties, and commercial interests around the world,۝ activities that were completely۝ legal. It would be odd, indeed, if he did not frequently travel, both domestically and abroad, given his clientele and the nature of his business,۝ Downing wrote. He also noted that Manafort has been married for almost 40 years and has two daughters and two grandchildren in the U.S.He said that his client۪s primary assets are also in the United States. One of the charges that Manafort is facing relates to his alleged failure to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which requires lobbyists to disclose when they۪re working on behalf of a foreign principal. Downing, not incorrectly , said that particular charge was rarely pursued (or successfully prosecuted) in a criminal case.۝ Manafort is currently on house arrest under electronic monitoring and a $10 million unsecured bond. He۪s seeking less onerous conditions of release.

The sticker on the back window did not mince words. It read Fuck Trump and Fuck You For Voting For Him,۝ and that rubbed Fort Bend County Sheriff Troy Nehls the wrong way. Nehls, a Republican who the Houston Chronicle said is thinking about running for Congress, went to his personal Facebook page to suggest there might be a little problem with the truck۪s political message. I have received numerous calls regarding the offensive display on this truck as it is often seen along FM [Farm to Market Road] 359. ... Our Prosecutor has informed us she would accept Disorderly Conduct charges regarding it, but I feel we could come to an agreement regarding a modification to it,۝ he wrote. Nehls later deleted the post, but not before the American Civil Liberties Union had helpfully saved it for posterity. The ACLU also offered a reminder that the Constitution that Nehls is supposed to defend allows for peaceful, if foul-mouthed protests: No,Sheriff Troy E. Nehls, you can۪t prosecute speech just because it contains words you don۪t like. The owner of this truck should contact the ACLU of Texas . The potential charges looked dubious at best to one person responding to Nehls on Facebook. If the owner turns his or herself in and then faces charges, please tell me where I can contribute to a legal defense fund to help defend against these politically motivated charges ,۝ the man wrote, according to KHOU TV. Another person who thought Nehls overstepped his bounds was John Healey, the district attorney of Fort Bend County.He told KTRK that the sheriff never consulted him about whether the anti-Trump sticker was violating any laws . Healey also questioned whether the sticker۪s language met the legal requirements for disorderly conduct.ʉThe words would have to tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace,۪۝he told the station. But if no one has become violent or confrontational toward the truck۪s owner ۥ and there۪s no police report stating that happened ۥ the district attorney said there۪s no disorderly conduct. Numerous media outlets tracked down the owner of the truck, who said she used to work for Nehls at the county jail. Karen Fonseca told the Houston Chronicle that she and her husband had the sticker made shortly after President Donald Trump۪s inauguration. It attracts all types of reactions, she said, including photo-taking by some people and head shakes from others. In addition, she has been pulled over by police officers, none of whom could find a reason for writing a ticket. It۪s not to cause hate or animosity,۝ the 46-year-old Fonseca told the paper. It۪s just our freedom of speech and we۪re exercising it.۝ In a twist, she was later arrested on an outstanding warrant on unrelated charges of fraudulent use or possession of information, according to jail records. The Fort Bend County sheriff۪s office released this statement on Thursday afternoon: The Sheriff made the post on his Personal page. The objective of the post was to find the owner/driver of the truck and have a conversation with them in order to prevent a potential altercation between the truck driver and those offended by the message. Since the owner of the truck has been identified, the Sheriff took down the post. Due to the hate messages he has been receiving towards his wife and children, the Sheriff will not be commenting on the matter further."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/governors-letter-skinny-repeal-bill-obamacare_us_59791482e4b02a4ebb72a510","A bipartisan group of 10 governors wrote a letter Wednesday urging the Senate to reject a proposed skinny۝ health care bill that Republican leaders are now trying feverishly to pass. And if the collective voice of so many governors doesn۪t get the attention of GOP leaders, the letter۪s endorsement by one particular Republican governor might. It۪s Brian Sandoval, from Nevada. He has emerged as a key player in the health care debate because GOP leaders in Washington desperately need the vote of Nevada۪s Republican senator, Dean Heller . Heller۪s opposition alone could very well sink legislation, given that two out of the Senate۪s 52 Republicans have already said they would oppose any Obamacare repeal option now under official discussion.And Heller has said he will listen closely to what Sandoval advises. If you want my support _ you better make sure that the Republican governors that have expanded Medicaid sign off on it,۝ Heller said in a June press conference , at which he appeared alongside Sandoval. I۪ve been saying that for months. _ Where is Governor Sandoval? What does he think?۝ It۪s a pressing question, because the Senate is on track to vote on a repeal bill by week۪s end, and the focus of GOP leaders has shifted. Having failed so far to find a majority that would support a sweeping repeal effort, the leaders are now talking about passing a much narrower measure that,at least on paper, would do very little except eliminate the Affordable Care Act۪s individual mandate. The strategic theory of the skinny bill is that the individual mandate, which fines people who decline to get insurance, is among the most unpopular provisions in Obamacare. Folding its elimination into a bill that also repeals the employer mandate and device tax, but leaves out contentious issues like cutting Medicaid or changing the rules for private insurance, would supposedly be an easier vote for all Republicans. Once such a bill got through the Senate, the argument goes, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and his allies could start negotiating with their counterparts in the House, which passed a broader reform bill in May, to hash out a compromise that could eventually pass both chambers. Heller is among the key Republican senators who have already indicated they۪re inclined to support such a measure, as long as it doesn۪t touch Medicaid. But critics have warned Heller and other Republicans that nothing would prevent House and Senate leaders from adding Medicaid cuts in their negotiations. And even if the skinny bill were to become law as is, without additional Medicaid provisions, it would pose a danger to the private insurance market simply by eliminating the individual mandate . The mandate pushes healthy people to buy coverage, thereby making it possible for insurers to offer coverage to anybody with pre-existing conditions. Without it, insurers would likely jack up rates above and beyond where they would already be ۥ a possibility the governors raised explicitly in the letter. The Senate should also reject efforts to amend the bill into a skinny repeal,۪ which is expected to accelerate health plans leaving the individual market, increase premiums, and result in fewer Americans having access to coverage,۝ says the letter, which Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D), Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) and Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) also signed. Passing a skinny bill could actually affect premiums as early as next year, even if Senate leaders don۪t envision it becoming law, because insurers must finalize rates within the next few weeks. They might raise rates pre-emptively ۥ just in case House-Senate negotiations prove fruitless and Republicans end up enacting the law because it is their only way to pass something they can call repeal.۝ One GOP senator, Rand Paul of Kentucky , is already suggesting that enacting the skinny bill without amendment might be the best possible outcome. As it is, plenty of insurers are nervous because the Trump administration has started cutting funds for efforts to help enrollment ۥ and because the administration has signaled it might stop paying crucial, legally contested payments to insurers. Policy analysts debate how much the mandate is actually impacting enrollment, but plans will price as though repeal of the mandate drives adverse selection,۝ Caroline Pearson , senior vice president at Avalere consulting, told HuffPost. So, passing a skinny repeal bill that repeals the mandate would directly increase premiums for the following year.۝"
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-obamacare-vote-pretty-impressive_us_596e43e5e4b0000eb19643a3","President Donald Trump downplayed the Senate Republican leadership۪s failure to line up the votes necessary to repeal and replace Obamacare , claiming that coming up two votes short was pretty impressive.۝ Speaking to reporters alongside Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday, Trump said he was very disappointed۝ that several Republican senators did not get behind the bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) could afford to lose only two of the 52 GOP senators and still pass the legislation. But on Tuesday, it appeared he۪d lost four of his members. Considering Democrats۪ absolute opposition to that bill, Trump said he was still pleased with how close the legislation had come to passage. Essentially the vote would have been pretty close too, if you look at it: 48 to 4,۝ said Trump, referring to the Republican side only. That۪s a pretty impressive vote by any standard.۝ You need more ۥ that۪s pretty tough,۝ he added. To avoid a repeat of this week۪s failure, Trump said he would work hard to elect more Republicans to the Senate in 2018 to increase the GOP majority. We have to go out and we have to get more people elected that are Republican,۝ Trump said. And we have to probably pull in those people, those few people who voted against it.۝ Earlier in the day, Trump also suggested that he favors abolishing the filibuster, which allows senators to block much legislation that does not have a 60-vote majority. The health care bill that stalled in the Senate was specifically designed as a budget reconciliation measure, which is not subject to filibuster, so that Republicans could pass it with a simple majority ۥ or even 50 yeas plus Pence۪s tie-breaking vote.But Trump noted on Twitter that other aspects of Obamacare repeal would effectively require 60 votes under current Senate rules. Trump۪s protestations that his agenda is being hampered by the Republicans۪ relatively small majority in the Senate and by Democratic opposition are at odds with his criticism of then-President Barack Obama for blaming Republican obstruction for hindering his policies. In fact, in a 2012 tweet, Trump pointed to the Democrats۪ control of Congress in 2009 and 2010 as evidence that Obama had ample opportunity to enact his preferred policies. Trump now similarly enjoys Republican majorities in both houses of Congress and has the advantage of a conservative Supreme Court, which Obama lacked. In April, McConnell got rid of the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, clearing the way for Justice Neil Gorsuch۪s confirmation . The president sent mixed signals Tuesday about how he plans to move forward on Obamacare repeal. Although he implied that repealing the Affordable Care Act would require a larger Republican majority, he also said that the growing problems in Obamacare۪s individual insurance marketplace would create pressure for a bipartisan fix. I۪ve been saying for a long time: Let Obamacare fail and everybody۪s going to have to come together and fix it and come up with a new plan and a plan that۪s really good for the people with much lower premiums and much lower costs and much better protection,۝ Trump said. McConnell had canceled plans to vote on the bill to repeal and replace Obamacare on Monday night when two conservative Republicans, Sens. Mike Lee (Utah) and Jerry Moran (Kan.), simultaneously announced their opposition to the legislation. Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), another hardliner, and Susan Collins (R-Maine), a moderate, had already announced their opposition, leaving McConnell no room for further attrition. In lieu of the replacement bill, the majority leader announced his intention to seek a vote on a straight repeal bill to take effect in two years, during which time Republicans would presumably coalesce around a replacement. But by Tuesday morning, Republican Sens. Collins, Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.) all declared that they would not allow such a vote to proceed, effectively derailing McConnell۪s plan. This story has been updated with more detail on Trump۪s health care remarks and the path the Senate bill has taken."

Futerfas who represents the president۪s son Donald Trump Jr. The timing of the payment is certainly raising eyebrows. Trump claimed he found out about the controversial meeting his son held with a Kremlin-linked lawyer around the time the New York Times first reported it, but the payment to Trump Jr.۪s lawyer was made eleven days before. According to the disclosure forms, Trump۪s presidential campaign made a $50,000 payment to Futerfas۪ law firm on June 27, 2017. The first story about Trump Jr.۪s meeting with lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya went up on the New York Times website on July 8, 2017, 11 days after the payment was made. On July 12, in an exchange with reporters on Air Force One en route to Paris, Trump said,  I only heard about it [Trump Jr۪s meeting with the Russian lawyer] two or three days ago.۝ A report from Yahoo News this week revealed that Trump۪s lawyers knew about the email chain between Trump Jr. and music publicist Rob Goldstone for weeks. According to the Yahoo News report, Trump۪s lead attorney, Marc Kasowitz and Alan Garten,general counsel of the Trump organization, found out about the now infamous email exchange the third week of June. The payment from Trump۪s committee was made the fourth week of June. Trump is known to be careful with spending, monitoring expenses closely and grousing when too much money is spent. The fact that a $50,000 payment, to a criminal defense attorney that represents his son on a matter related to the Russia investigation,could be made by a campaign committee he controls without his knowledge would certainly be surprising according to two sources familiar with Trump۪s oversight of campaign expenses. A spokesman for Trump۪s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The use of campaign funds to pay for Trump Jr.۪s personal legal bills is also eyebrow raising. President Trump claims he is worth $10 billion dollars ( Bloomberg News says he is worth $2.86 billion and Forbes says he is worth $3.5 billion ). A majority of Trump۪s campaign donations come from low-dollar donors, the type that give less than $100. That a family worth billions is using campaign committee funds to pay personal legal bills is not something that is likely to go over well with Trump۪s base in the long-run. The expenditure appears to be legal though. Lawrence Noble, who served as general counsel of the Federal Elections Commission and currently serves as general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center told HuffPost if Futerfas۪ representation of Trump Jr. is strictly related to matters pertaining to the presidential campaign then it is permissible to pay him from the campaign committee. But if the investigation turns to noncampaign matters, as some have speculated it might given that special counsel Robert Mueller has broad investigative powers, it would not be legal for the Trump campaign to cover Trump Jr.۪s legal bills.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/discrimination-lgbt-private-religious-schools_us_5a32a45de4b00dbbcb5ba0be","LYNCHBURG, Va. ۥ Sunnie Kahle used to think that if she promised to be good, she could go back to her old school. She۪d plead with her great-grandmother to let her enroll again at Timberlake Christian Schools, where she had gone since she was 3 years old. Even if teachers were mean to her, even if other kids said bad things about her, she wouldn۪t be mad. She just wanted her old life back. Her great-grandmother and guardian, Doris Thompson, 74, didn۪t know how to tell Sunnie she wasn۪t allowed back at the school. Administrators didn۪t want her there. In a 2014 letter to Thompson that essentially expelled Sunnie, the school referenced several passages from the Bible as to why they wouldn۪t take her back. They suggested Sunnie wasn۪t acting Christlike۝ by wearing her hair short and preferring pants to skirts. Sunnie was 8 years old. She wasn۪t traditionally feminine enough for them. Timberlake Christian Schools in Virginia is one of over at least 700 religious schools in America currently receiving public money while openly advertising and practicing anti-LGBTQ policies, HuffPost has found in a new investigation. HuffPost has been examining private schools that receive taxpayer dollars through voucher or tax credit programs. We created a database of more than 7,000 schools in 25 states and the District of Columbia with private school choice programs that give public money to private religious schools. In the first story of this investigation, which we published earlier in December, we looked at what was being taught. We discovered thousands of schools that used evangelical Christian curricula, largely considered inaccurate and unscientific. In our second article, we singled out a handful of schools that purported to be secular but maintained strong ties to the Church of Scientology . For this story, we researched the number of schools in our database that practice discrimination toward LGBTQ students and staff members. We visited every website of each school in search of evidence of their attitudes and policies on gender-nonconforming and LGBTQ students. If a school did not advertise a specific policy, we followed up via email or a call. For Catholic schools, we looked for diocese-wide policies on these issues. Often, these schools had policies against heterosexual sex before marriage, as well. We found at least 14 percent of religious schools take an active stance against LGBTQ staff and students.Some of these schools have policies on their websites generally broadcasting their opposition to same-sex marriage or even stating their belief that homosexuality is a sin on par with bestiality. Others have harsher policies ۥ specifically stating that students can face punishments, like expulsion, for displaying signs of a homosexual lifestyle۝ or alternate gender identity.۝ At least 5 percent of these schools also have explicit policies against hiring or retaining LGBTQ staff. On the other hand, we also found many schools that have policies specifically protecting students from discrimination based on sexual orientation. Many more of these schools belong to larger churches that preach anti-LGBTQ sentiment. The Seventh-day Adventist Church is opposed to homosexual practices and relationships,۝ per the denomination۪s website . The Roman Catholic Church says marriage can occur only between a man and woman. We did not assume that schools identifying with these groups were hostile places for LGBTQ students. In our count, we included only schools (or dioceses) that had a specific anti-LGBTQ policy. In that way, our numbers represent a bare minimum of schools where LGBTQ students may encounter hostility. Religious schools are generally exempt from the types of regulations that would protect students and teachers from discrimination based on sexual orientation. It۪s only in recent years, though, that these schools have received an injection of taxpayer funds with the rise and expansion of state-level private school choice programs. Since President Donald Trump and his secretary of education, Betsy DeVos , have expressed the desire to use federal dollars to increase private school choice, it۪s worth closely examining which students are served and which are not. After Sunnie was kicked out of Timberlake, her great-grandma transferred her to public school. Thompson, who is emphatic when she talks about Sunnie, in the way only proud grandmas do, has a tattoo on her wrist that says, Family is forever.۝ Sitting in her living room, the walls lined with photos of Sunnie, here in this city just a couple of hours from Richmond, the Virginia capital, Thompson explained how she came to be Sunnie۪s guardian. It۪s a complicated tale of mental illness and addiction, but since Sunnie was 2 months old, Thompson has been her protector. In February of 2014, when Sunnie was in the second grade, the school principal sent a letter home to Thompson saying that, although Sunnie was a very bright girl,۝ she recommended that Sunnie not re-enroll the next year if she wasn۪t able to dress۝ and behave accordingly with her God-ordained identity۝ as a female. Thompson pulled her out of the school immediately. They pretty much ruined a little girl۪s life,۝ said Thompson, who helps with her husband Carroll۪s truck repair business. Sunnie didn۪t attend Timberlake using a publicly funded scholarship through Virginia۪s tax credit program for low-income students. But the year she was kicked out, other students did. During the fiscal year of 2014, Timberlake received $104,121.57 in scholarships. That number has increased. For the fiscal year of 2017, the school received $237,500, per the Virginia Department of Education. In Virginia, tax credits are given to individuals and corporations that donate to scholarship programs. These scholarship groups then help low-income students attend private schools. Voucher programs are more direct: Taxpayer funds help provide voucher scholarships for students who meet certain requirements to attend private schools. A 2016 analysis of voucher program rules conducted by Indiana University professor Suzanne Eckes found that not a single one had protections preventing discrimination for LGBTQ students. Eckes did not include tax credit programs in her research. So HuffPost conducted a similar analysis including programs that were left out by Eckes. We found the same trend. Only one state۪s program, Maryland۪s, protected students from discrimination based on sexual orientation. While in our research we found a handful of Maryland schools that expressed opposition to same-sex marriage and homosexuality, each stopped short of saying they would deny these students admission. DeVos has been pressed before on if private schools receiving federal money under a possible voucher program would be required to prohibit anti-LGBTQ discrimination. In June, testifying before a Senate subcommittee , DeVos said that such a program would have to follow federal law. Indeed, in an email to HuffPost, a spokesperson for DeVos emphasized the fact that there is no federal voucher program and that, if there were, it would have to comply with federal law.۝ The problem is federal law is murky. The Obama administration interpreted Title IX ۥ the federal law banning sex discrimination in schools ۥ to include protections for LGBTQ students. The Trump administration seems to think these decisions should be made at the local level. There۪s no federal protections for LGBTQ students outside of Title IX,۝ said Nathan Smith, director for public policy for the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network. We still think it covers LGBTQ students, despite the fact that this administration doesn۪t think so.۝ Advocates of school choice emphasize that anti-LGBTQ bullying is a problem in all schools, not just private religious ones that participate in voucher programs. They preach the bigger cause of giving parents the ability to choose the most appropriate school for their child. Indeed, voucher programs are typically targeted to low-income families who normally wouldn۪t be able to afford the private school of their choice. I abhor discrimination and I would hope that schools would not discriminate against LGBTQ students even if the issue is part of their statements of faith,۝ wrote Robert Enlow, CEO and president of EdChoice, an education reform group, in an email. I also recognize, though, that we live in a pluralistic society that values choice, individual freedom and an abiding respect for all faiths. I trust parents to make the best choices for their kids based on their shared values and goals.۝ But Thompson hopes leaders at Timberlake know that their interpretation of faith is one without merit.  I feel sorry for them,۝ Thompson said, referring to administrators at Timberlake, if they have to answer and stand before our God one day.۝ The 74-year-old describes Sunnie as the great love of her life. Even after raising two kids and helping with three grandkids, Sunnie is her ultimate baby. The child has always been fiercely loyal and unfailingly independent, and she has a heart as sweet as apple pie, Thompson said, beaming with pride when asked about Sunnie۪s personality. But now, at 12, Sunnie is also angry and sad. Life was never going to be easy for Sunnie. Sunnie۪s mom had her as a teen. Sunny۪s father has not been a consistent presence, Thompson said. Sunnie۪s story of being kicked out of Timberlake was largely covered in the media when it first happened in 2014. Headlines screamed outrage. Sunnie was another victim of homophobia, another viral story here today and gone tomorrow. What wasn۪t covered is what happened next. Sunnie didn۪t want to leave Timberlake. From her point of view, it was a place where she was loved and accepted by her friends. At her new public school, she was teased. The other students would call her it۝ and gay.۝ Sunnie made one friend ۥ he used to come over on weekends, and they would play games, Thompson recalled. Then, suddenly, the boy۪s father stopped letting him come over. The father said Sunnie needed to find out her gender۝ before they could hang out again. Things didn۪t get better. First, Sunnie faked being sick so often that truancy became a problem. Sunnie didn۪t talk to HuffPost for this article for reasons that HuffPost is not reporting to protect the privacy of a minor. But Thompson wants Sunnie۪s story to be heard. Being so young, she really doesn۪t know how she feels. She doesn۪t know what she wants to be. Or who she wants to be,۝ Thompson said as her eyes welled with tears, reliving the trauma Sunnie experienced. Sunnie still doesn۪t talk about feelings she may or may not be having. She۪s on the verge of puberty. But Thompson worries about what will happen next. At the time that Sunnie was kicked out of school, lawyers for Timberlake Christian Schools told the media: Parents and guardians send their children to the School because of our Christian beliefs and standards. We have a duty to create an environment that is supportive of these Christian values.۝ HuffPost reached out to the school and asked if they had anything further to add about Sunnie۪s situation, years later. They said they did not. The school۪s anti-LGBTQ policy remains in place. Punishable behaviors include, but is not necessarily limited to, living in, condoning or supporting sexual immorality; practicing homosexual lifestyle or alternative gender identity; promoting such practices; or otherwise having the inability to support the moral principles of the school,۝ according to the school۪s website . Sunnie۪s story is unusual because of how young she is. She had adult thoughts and projections pushed on her before she was even close to having them herself. But a similar version of this story plays out around the country regularly. In 2012, the same year 15,000 Indiana students used vouchers , Warren came out to his family and friends as transgender, he told HuffPost. At the end of his junior year, he informed the principal at his Catholic school that he would be returning as a boy for his senior year. The bishop from the diocese overseeing Cathedral High School thought this was unacceptable. But instead of kicking Warren out, or telling him not to come back, administrators ignored the way he chose to identify, Warren said. Teachers were told that if they called Warren by his chosen name, they would face reprisal. Those with whom Warren was close, who wanted to respect his new identity, were afraid to buck the diocese, he said. Some found workarounds by calling him by his last name or initials. Warren was deeply involved in the school marching band as well as the school۪s plays. During the marching band performances, they would announce the performers. Warren asked announcers to leave his name out, since he knew only his dead name۝ would be announced. He asked not to be listed in the programs for the school plays. I was pretty depressed a lot of the time. I had horrible social anxiety,۝ said Warren, who۪s withholding his last name because his college peers are not aware of his transition. Even after Warren got his name changed legally that school year, the school refused to accept it. They sent off his high school transcripts to colleges with the wrong name, compelling Warren to explain the confusion to admissions offices, thereby being forced to out himself. A representative of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis said that it opens its doors to all who are committed to a quality Catholic education, regardless of race, ethnicity, sex, gender, socio-economics, religion, learning differences, etc. Our admissions policies and practices at each local site conform to this approach.۝ The high school did not respond to requests for comment on the situation. The diocese does, however, have a policy against employing staff members in same-sex unions, a representative told HuffPost during data collection. For Warren and Sunnie, other kids at their private schools were not the problem. They were supportive. It was the adults. Thompson only hopes the adults at Timberlake learn to treat children with kindness and empathy. God wants you to love everybody,۝ she said. Especially his children. He loves his children.۝ Thompson is attending regular counseling sessions to educate herself on how to be the best parent she can be to her great-granddaughter.  Course, now I۪m 74 years old, so I don۪t know that I۪m going to be around here 10 years, when she۪ll be 22 years old. I hope to God that he will let me stay here until she is grown. But I hope that she will make something of herself. Be somebody, and be proud of who she is.۝ Data and graphics by Alissa Scheller.

For the last several weeks, attention has focused on several GOP senators who have criticized the impact that their leadership۪s bills would have on the millions of people who depend upon the Affordable Care Act for their health insurance. Most come from states that expanded their Medicaid programs, taking advantage of extra federal matching funds Obamacare made available.

On Tuesday, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, the two Republican senators who have spoken out against such cuts most consistently, voted against the key procedural step that allowed the debate on health care legislation to go forward. They sat together in the Senate chamber and, at least metaphorically, they were also sitting alone. The other GOP senators who have warned they can۪t support legislation that produces big coverage losses ۥ including Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Dean Heller of Nevada, and Rob Portman of Ohio ۥ all voted yes. So did Arizona۪s John McCain , who made a dramatic return from brain surgery. Moderates۪ Keep Giving McConnell The Support He Needs Tuesday۪s vote did not resolve what has become the defining tension of the repeal effort ۥ the contradiction between Republican promises to provide  great coverage for everyone ,۝ as President Donald Trump likes to put it, and the party۪s proposals that would take coverage away from many millions. The pitch by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to the moderates has basically been a plea for time, in the hopes he can eventually find a compromise. The ones who voted yes on Tuesday۪s procedural motion went out of their way to say they were taking McConnell at his word ۥ that, by allowing the debate to go forward, they were not signaling support for the bills on the table already. If the final product isn۪t improved for the state of Nevada, then I will not vote for it,۝ Heller said in a statement. More emphatic still was McCain, who made his point while speaking from the floor: I voted for the motion to proceed to allow debate to continue and amendments to be offered. I will not vote for the bill as it is today.۝ But hours after the procedural vote, the Senate took up the Better Care Reconciliation Act ۥ the proposal from GOP leadership that would leave 22 million more people uninsured, by CBO۪s reckoning. McCain voted aye. So did Capito, Cassidy, Heller and Portman ۥ with the latter citing, as his reason, an amendment he۪d helped obtain providing $100 billion in extra funding to help people pay their out-of-pocket medical costs. In theory, Portman۪s amendment would offset the effects of ending the Medicaid expansion. In reality, that money would not be nearly enough to make up for the cuts, as new reports from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Urban Institute make clear. The bill needed 60 votes, because of parliamentary rules, and got just 43. Because everybody knew in advance it would fail , the vote was effectively a free oneʉۥ and potentially a chance for the likes of Capito and Portman to get some credit for supporting repeal, even if they end up opposing whatever comes up for a final vote when this week۪s deliberations end. The Bill Is Likely To Get Worse ۥ And Harder To Oppose Quite possibly that legislation will be what۪s come to be known as a  skinny bill .۝ O ne of McConnell۪s fallback plans is to winnow the health care measure down to a handful of elements, including repeal of the individual mandate that penalizes people who have access to insurance but decline to buy it, on the theory that such a modest bill would be mutually acceptable the different factions in his caucus. The point wouldn۪t be for that legislation to become law. Rather, the goal would be to start negotiations between the House and the Senate, in the hopes of producing a bigger bill that eventually could get support in both chambers. That might be enough to keep the likes of Capito and Heller in the fold on the skinny bill. They could say, once again, they were simply voting to keep the debate going ۥ to give GOP leaders just a little more time to work out the details and craft a compromise that would do right by their constituents. It۪s impossible to know what would happen then. Even veteran congressional staffers are having trouble gaming this all out. But if the Senate walks into negotiations with a skinny bill, then the House health care bill that passed in early May is likely to become the basis for writing final legislation. That bill includes a set of cuts to Medicaid and to private insurance tax credits that look an awful lot like the ones in the Senate leadership bill defeated Monday night. The House bill would leave 23 million additional people uninsured, according to CBO, which means that even a milder version would mean massive losses of coverage. Any final compromise would still require approval of the House and Senate, which means the moderates would still get one last chance to vote against the legislation ۥ to reject the kinds of cuts they keep saying, over and over again, they can۪t tolerate. But unlike now, when the options are diffuse and the process opaque and it۪s easy to pin blame for failure on somebody else, any vote following a House-Senate negotiation will be a clear up-or-down, make-or-break decision on repeal. Saying no at that point, after GOP leaders put in so much effort, could be much tougher. We۪ve Seen This Movie Before ۥ Just A Few Months Ago McConnell and his allies surely know this. And they remember what happened in the House, where Republican leaders eventually crafted an extremely conservative piece of legislation and got moderate holdouts to go along by badgering them and offering token concessions for the sake of appearances. If House-Senate negotiations produce a conservative bill that dramatically cuts coverage, leaders can use the same combination of pressure and guile to get anxious moderates in line. The consequences for the moderates۪ constituents would be devastating. In West Virginia, for example, the number of people who would lose their Medicaid coverage under the House bill could approach 200,000, according to an Urban Institute projection. That would be nearly half the program۪s non-elderly population. But to prevent those consequences, at least one more moderate probably has to vote no at some point. And although each may be waiting for one of the others to take the plunge, there۪s probably more safety in numbers. A group dissent might even kickstart a bipartisan conversation that could actually produce legislation to shore up coverage ۥ as Republicans say they will do, even now ۥ and give the GOP political points for governing successfully. Of course, all of that assumes Capito, Heller and the others mean what they have said about protecting their constituents.After Tuesday, that۪s not at all clear. CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that 47 senators voted for the Republican-sponsored Better Care Reconciliation Act on Tuesday night. The correct number is 43."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/moderate-republican-senators-dean-heller-obamacare-trouble_us_5968ee6fe4b017418627154d","For all of the signs that the GOP health care bill is on life support , a key fact should still frighten Obamacare proponents: None of the so-called moderate Republican senators who could kill the bill have done so. And one of them, Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), who threw cold water on the legislation early on with a scathing statement, can be bought off۝ with perks for his home-state, according to a report in Axios . At this point, the Senate is deliberating over its second iteration of Obamacare repeal that has been ever-so-slightly modified to pick up the support of both centrist and hard-line conservative skeptics. To address the concerns of moderates, the bill۪s revisions keep in place a 3.8-percent Obamacare tax on investment income for individuals making more than $200,000 a year and significantly increases funding for opioid addiction treatment. At the same time, to pick up the backing on Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and like-minded allies, an amendment would allow insurers to offer plans that don۪t comply with Obamacare coverage regulations so long as they offer at least one plan that does. The rules that the plans would be permitted to flout include community rating provisions, which prevent insurers from charging people with pre-existing medical conditions higher rates. Two senators announced their opposition to the new bill right away: Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine). Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) can only lose two of his 52-member conference and still pass the bill (with the help of Vice President Mike Pence۪s tie-breaking vote). But a curious thing happened Thursday, after McConnell released the text of the new bill, which still unwinds the Medicaid expansion and undermines protections for people with pre-existing conditions . No one else came forward to sink the bill. It appeared as if the senators who would oppose the bill were waiting for another senator to cast the third and final vote that kills the bill. Among that group of potential no۝ votes is a small list of more moderate Republicans: Sens. Rob Portman (Ohio), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.) John Hoeven (N.D.) and Heller. The opioid addiction funding was politically helpful for Capito and Portman, who hail from states at the heart of the epidemic. Portman has nonetheless expressed concerns about the fate of Medicaid beneficiaries in Ohio, where Republican Gov. John Kasich has vigorously defended Ohio۪s acceptance of Obamacare funds to expand the program. The bill also includes a provision that could give Murkowski cover by offering additional funding for insurers in Alaska where premiums are more than 75 percent higher than the national average. But of all the senators on the fence, Heller appears to be the most important. He is the only skeptic up for reelection in 2018. And in a state that went for Hillary Clinton in November, he is perhaps the most vulnerable Republican in the entire Senate. Nevada۪s Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval, a popular moderate who expanded Medicaid under Obamacare, has also indicated he opposes the bill. Which explains why Heller took the strongest position against the Senates۪ first version of the bill. Where other senators alluded to various concerns in staid terms, Heller۪s comments sounded more like the sort of stinging rebuke that would come from a Democrat. I cannot support a piece of legislation that takes insurance away from tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Nevadans,۝ he said at a June 23 press conference alongside Sandoval, with former Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid standing backstage. There is nothing in the new Senate bill to suggest that it would prevent more Americans from losing their health insurance, though senators may not have an official score from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to confirm its exact impact one way or another. Nor is there any reason to believe it would lower insurance premiums, another concern of Heller۪s. So it was surprising Thursday when Heller, sneaking out a backdoor from McConnell۪s office, told reporters staking out the meeting that he was undecided۝ after very, very good۝ conversations with McConnell. The Axios report said Republicans believe Heller۪s support could be purchased with a few goodies, and that could be the key for passing this Senate health care bill. If Murkowski was bought off with funds from a long-term stability fund for her state, and Portman and Capito got their opioid funding, save Heller, North Dakota۪s John Hoeven would perhaps be the biggest question mark left ۥ and no one should reasonably think a senator from a state that President Donald Trump won by over 35 percentage points would be the one to sink this effort. After Heller۪s June press conference announcing his opposition, most Republicans thought McConnell had his work cut out for him, as Collins and Paul had both looked likely to oppose the bill from the very start. That Heller isn۪t rushing out to announce his opposition, perhaps even sending McConnell back to the drawing board, could be an indication that he either wants this effort to fail, or that this bill is truly about to pass. Heller۪s office did not respond to a request for comment. Matt Fuller contributed reporting."
"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-daca-decision_us_59a04060e4b05710aa5bda7b","WASHINGTON ۥ The Trump administration is officially terminating the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals in six months and punting the matter to Congress, putting nearly 800,000 young undocumented immigrants at risk of deportation if the president and members of the House and Senate can۪t make a deal to protect them. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump ۥ who later said he has a great heart۝ and great love۝ for undocumented young people ۥ sent out Attorney General Jeff Sessions to announce his policy decision. Sessions, who supports enforcing current law through increased deportations, has opposed the DACA program since its inception under President Barack Obama in 2012. As a senator, he helped block legislative efforts to help so-called Dreamers۝ who came to the U.S. as children. We are people of compassion and we are people of law,۝ Sessions said during a speech at the Department of Justice. But there is nothing compassionate about the failure to enforce immigration laws. ... The compassionate thing to do is to end the lawlessness, enforce our laws and, if Congress chooses to make changes to those laws, to do so through the process set forth by our founders in a way that advances the interest of the American people.۝ DACA protections, which last for two years and allow Dreamers to work legally, won۪t end immediately . Current DACA recipients whose permits expire between now and March 5 can apply to renew them, but must submit their renewal applications by Oct. 5 or will be unable to do so. Individuals who do not currently have DACA protections cannot receive permits unless they applied to the program before Sept. 5. Dreamers whose permits expire on March 6 or later will begin to lose their protections and work permits as soon as they expire, putting them at risk of deportation. Trump said in a statement that he advised the Department of Homeland Security that DACA recipients are not enforcement priorities unless they are criminals, are involved in criminal activity, or are members of a gang.۝ But losing DACA protections would nonetheless put Dreamers at risk of being sent away from the country they۪ve lived in since they were children.Although administration officials have said their focus is on deporting criminals, they have also made clear that no undocumented immigrant is safe from being detained or forced out of the country. That includes Dreamers, some of whom have already been locked up. Department of Homeland Security officials said before the announcement that there are no plans to specifically target current DACA recipients or use their information for enforcement purposes, although they will continue to do so if needed for criminal or national security investigations. The official Trump administration announcement comes on the Sept. 5 deadline set by 10 state attorneys general who threatened legal action if Trump did not announce a phaseout of DACA by that date. Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery III (R) backed off that threat last week , but the others continued to demand an end to the program. The threat was not a court order, so it was not a mandate for the Trump administration to end the program ahead of a legal challenge or ruling. Trump misstated the facts of the threat in a statement after Sessions۪ announcement. The president claimed thatʉofficials from 10 States are suing over the program,۝ even though they had not taken legal action and only nine of the 10 states had maintained that threat. Trump decided to end DACA against the wishes of Democrats and some members of his own party, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who said Congress should get the chance to pass a bill. The president said on Tuesday afternoon that he hoped Congress would move forward to help Dreamers, although he said nothing about what he thinks they should do. I have a love for these people and hopefully now Congress will be able to help them and do it properly,۝ Trump said in the White House. And I can tell you, speaking to members of Congress, they want to be able to do something and do it right. ...I think it۪s going to work out very well and long-term, it۪s going to be the right solution.۝ Ahead of Trump۪s announcement, a number of Republicans said they would be willing to support protections for Dreamers that Democrats have attempted to get through Congress multiple times. Most Republicans opposed those past measures, including the Dream Act, a bill first introduced in 2001 that would grant legal status to some undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. The bill has a small number of Republican supporters, but the White House immediately shot it down when it was re-introduced in the Senate in July. Some Republicans are pushing what they say is a more conservative version of the Dream Act, called the Recognizing America۪s Children Act, or RAC Act, which would offer a path to citizenship to a smaller category of Dreamers. Sessions۪ speech only mentioned one piece of legislation specifically: the RAISE Act , which would slash legal immigration numbers and has nothing to do with Dreamers. His remarks more broadly made the case against offering Dreamers legal status, something he has opposed many times throughout his career. Sessions said that DACA denied jobs to hundreds of thousands of Americans by allowing those same illegal aliens to take those jobs۝ ۥ an argument that could also be applied to legislation that allows Dreamers to stay in the country and work legally. He claimed that a surge in unaccompanied minors at the southwest U.S. border was also due to DACA, although those children were ineligible for the program. Sessions also said that the U.S. must set and enforce a limit on how many immigrants we admit each year.۝ This does not mean they are bad people or that our nation disrespects or demeans them in any way,۝ Sessions said. It means we are properly enforcing our laws as Congress has passed them.۝ Trump۪s statement similarly emphasized other changes to the immigration system. Like Sessions, he cited the RAISE Act and said his first and highest priority in advancing immigration reform must be to improve jobs, wages and security for American workers and their families.۝ As I۪ve said before, we will resolve the DACA issue with heart and compassion  but through the lawful Democratic process  while at the same time ensuring that any immigration reform we adopt provides enduring benefits for the American citizens we were elected to serve,۝ the statement read. We must also have heart and compassion for unemployed, struggling, and forgotten Americans.۝ This story has been updated with Donald Trump۪s statements."

Obviously the president has been very clear on that,۝ Sekulow said on CBS۪s Face the Nation. He said he has had no meetings, was aware of no meetings with Russians, was not aware of this one until really right before it all broke. And that۪s what the president said. And in fact there۪s been no information to the contrary. So he۪s been very clear on that.۝ The meeting among Kremlin-backed lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, the president۪s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and others occurred during the height of the 2016 presidential campaign. An email to Trump Jr. promised assistance from the Russian government to  incriminate_ Democratic White House contender Hillary Clinton . _[I]f it۪s what you say I love it especially later in the summer,۝ Trump Jr. replied. On July 12, Sekulow similarly told NBC۪s Today Show,۝ The president did not see any emails relating to this at all. The president was not aware and did not attend this meeting and was only made aware of the email, and this chain of emails ... yesterday when it was released.۝ That same day, Trump told reporters that he heard about the meeting  two or three days ago .۝ Despite Sekulow۪s assurance, there is growing information to the contrary indicating that Trump may have known more than he let on: Trump۪s 2020 presidential campaign committee paid Alan Futerfas, Donald Trump, Jr.۪s personal defense lawyer, a $50,000 retainer on June 27. That payment happened more than a week before The New York Times published its story on July 8 .

In fact maybe it was mentioned at some point,۝ Trump said, according to the White House pool report. But he insisted he didn۪t know the purpose of the meeting was to get dirt on Clinton; he said he believed it was about Veselnitskaya۪s push to overturn a U.S. law sanctioning Russian officials for human rights abuses.Russian President Vladimir Putin retaliated to the sanctions by putting a stop to American adoptions of children from the country. Trump۪s personal legal team also learned about the email promising Trump Jr.opposition research on Clinton more than three weeks ago , according to Yahoo News. ۝[T]he information that Trump۪s lawyers were told about the emails in June raises questions about why they would not have immediately informed the president,۝ wrote Yahoo News reporter Michael Isikoff.
