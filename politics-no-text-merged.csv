1,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trent-franks-congress_us_5a29b044e4b0a290f04f4911","Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.)announced Thursday he is resigning from Congress next year. Several news outlets reported Franks impending departure from the House earlier Thursday. In a statement , Franks said the House Ethics Committee is investigating his discussion of surrogacy with two previous female subordinates, making each feel uncomfortable. I deeply regret that my discussion of this option and process in the workplace caused distress, he said. In the midst of this current cultural and media climate, I am deeply convinced I would be unable to complete a fair House Ethics investigation before distorted and sensationalized versions of this story would put me, my family, my staff, and my noble colleagues in the House of Representatives through hyperbolized public excoriation. Franks said he has informed House leadership he will resign effective Jan. 31. In a separate statement,the House Ethics Committee announced it will investigate Franks to determine whether he engaged in conduct that constitutes sexual harassment and/or retaliation for opposing sexual harassment. House Speaker Paul Ryan s (R-Wis.) office said in a statement Thursday that the speaker was briefed on credible claims of misconduct last week and then discussed the allegations with Franks, who did not deny them. Subsequent conversations took place this week between the speaker and Rep. Franks leading to the congressmans decision to offer his letter of resignation, the statement said . Franks huddled with colleagues on the House floor late Thursday afternoon. Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) had his arm wrapped around Franks, appearing to be consoling him. According to Roll Call, rumors of inappropriate behavior circulated before Franks announcement. The eight-term congressman is a social conservative and one of the most aggressive anti-abortion legislators in Congress. He has led the charge, year after year, to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy nationwide and to limit abortion in the District of Columbia. Residents of D.C. protested his efforts in 2012 by lining up outside the Arizona congressmans office with plastic rats and photos of pot holes, suggesting that he try to fix more pressing problems in the city than women having abortions. Franks also caused an uproar in 2013 when he claimed during an abortion debate that the incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low, defending his bills lack of an exception for rape and incest victims. The congressman is notorious for comparing abortion to slavery and the Holocaust .What changed peoples mind over slavery? he asked during a 2013 debate on the D.C. anti-abortion bill. What changed their minds over the tragedy in Eastern Europe, the horror in Eastern Europe? Franks further incensed minority rights groups last year when he introduced legislation to impose criminal penalties on doctors who are suspected of performing abortions based on the race or sex of the fetus, which they warned would codify dangerous stereotypes against women of color.

2,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-attacks-mitch-mcconnell-paul-ryan_us_599ecd1fe4b05710aa5a351f","President Donald Trump on Thursday lashed out at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), intensifying a feud with his own partys congressional leaders. In a pair of tweets targeting Mitch M and Paul R, Trump accused them of creating a mess in the challenge Congress faces to raise the federal debt ceiling when lawmakers return from recess in September. The U.S. Treasury is due to hit the debt ceiling at some point in October, and a failure to raise it to pay the governments bills could spur financial chaos. But hard-core conservative Republicans in Congress could block raising the ceiling by insisting such legislation include big cuts in federal spending. Trump has repeatedly lambasted GOP lawmakers for supposedly not working with him on legislative priorities, such as the debt ceiling and tax reform. Yet his lack of overtures toward them and continuing attacks perhaps are further worsening relations. On Tuesday night at a raucous rally in Arizona , the president threatened a government shutdown if Congress does not provide funding for his signature campaign promise, a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrats have stressed that they remain unalterably opposed to such funding. Trump at his rally also repeatedly attacked Republican lawmakers and singled out McConnell, telling the crowd, We have to speak to Mitch. Trump and McConnell reportedly have had a particularly frosty relationship, with the two men having not spoken for weeks, according to The New York Times . Trump, particularly angered by the multiple investigations into whether his campaign colluded with Russia in last years election, reportedly yelled at McConnell for not doing more to protect him from the probes, the Times reported. On Wednesday, both the White House and McConnells office pushed back against the article, releasing carefully worded statements that insisted that their relationship was fine. We are committed to advancing our shared agenda together and anyone who suggests otherwise is clearly not part of the conversation, McConnell said. The White House similarly asserted that Trump and McConnellremain united on many shared priorities. Yet an hour after his original tweets on Thursday, Trump again complained about McConnell, going after him for Republicans failed efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which the GOP has long promised. In addition to antagonizing McConnell, Trump has drawn ire from Republican leaders for criticizing GOP senators up for re-election next year, especially Jeff Flake of Arizona and Dean Heller of Nevada . In Flakes case, he has also met with and praised a candidate planning to challenge the incumbent in next years Republican primary.

3,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-pardon-himself_us_5973587be4b0e79ec1999463","President Donald Trump claimed he had the complete ability to pardon and appeared to be trying to redirect attention from a probe into alleged ties between his campaign and Russia in a series of tweets Saturday morning. Trumps pardon claim came after The Washington Post reported that he had inquired with his lawyers about how pardons work and speculation he is considering pardons for aides, his family, and even potentially himself. Its unclear if he actually could legally pardon himself. The Constitutions presidential pardon provision does not explicitly ban the president from doing so. But Elizabeth Holtzman , a former Democratic congresswoman who served on the House Judiciary Committee during the Watergate scandal, argued in a Post op-ed this month that the president pardoning himself would undermine the entire constitution. A presidential self-pardoning power would seriously undermine the rule of law. If presidents could self-pardon, they could engage in monstrously wrongful and criminal conduct with impunity, she wrote. That would utterly violate the framers belief in a limited presidency and in the idea that no president is above the law. Amid reports the White House is gearing up to try and discredit an investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russia ties, Trump also questioned why investigators werent looking into potential offenses he alleged his 2016 Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton and James Comey , the former FBI director, may have committed. The FBI did investigate Clintons use of a private email server during the presidential campaign and concluded it would not bring charges against her . Trump also addressed an August 2015 comment by Anthony Scaramucci , his new communications director , in which Scaramucci called him a hack politician. Scaramucci apologized for the comment Friday and said the president brings it up with him every 15 seconds. The comment apparently was still on Trumps mind Saturday, because he said Scaramucci had always wanted to endorse him.",1,38.55,13.9,15.8,313,13,"Donald Trump Insists He Has The 'Complete Power' To Pardon, As Russia Probe Persists",2017-07-22 10:49:00,"Sam Levine","Politics","@amazonecho,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_ga,anthony-scaramucci,democratic-politics,donald-trump,international-news,political-science,republican-politics,russia,type: news,us-news,us-presidential-elections",371122,333012,371122,411037,46291,221472,1.065,1.141,1.249,1.592,128899,201970,40253,31853,228332,5562,35521,47532,43683,3738,3,24,26661,26262,364,9,26,"Donald Trump Insists He Has The 'Complete Power' To Pardon, As Russia Probe Persists",2017-07-22 10:49:00,"Sam Levine","Politics","@amazonecho,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_ga,anthony-scaramucci,democratic-politics,donald-trump,international-news,political-science,republican-politics,russia,type: news,us-news,us-presidential-elections",371122,333012,371122,411037,46291,221472,1.065,1.141,1.249,1.592,128899,201970,40253,31853,228332,5562,35521,47532,43683,3738,3,24,26661,26262,364,9,26

Trump signed a memo banning transgender individuals from newly enlisting in the military and pardoned a former sheriff with a history of racist actions . One of his most controversial advisers resigned, and his administration teased theyd end a program that could put many young undocumented immigrants at risk of deportation. These controversial announcements all came as Hurricane Harvey bore down on the Texas Gulf Coast. The barrage of news coming from the White House, with each story notable in its own right, illustrated both an administration prone to crisis and ill-equipped to handle them, whether natural or self-made. The U.S. news was largely dominated by Hurricane Harvey throughout the day Friday, as the storm quickly escalated from Category 2 to Category 4, with winds escalating to 130 miles per hour. Millions of Texans were urged to flee their homes, with Republican Gov. Greg Abbott encouraging people to evacuate even if it wasnt mandatory . It is not hyperbole to say that if the forecast verifies, Texas is about to experience one of the worst natural disasters in the history of the state, Abbott said Friday in a written request for Trump to declare a major disaster. Trump wished Texans  good luck  as he departed the White House on Friday for Camp David in Maryland. But he and his administration seemed eager to use the natural disaster as a distraction. Just after 6 p.m. EDT Friday, Military Times reported that Trump signed a memo banning transgender men and women from enlisting in the military.The presidential memo also tasks Defense Secretary Jim Mattis with determining whether to remove already enlisted transgender individuals from service, and it bars the military from funding gender confirmation surgery. Trumps initial announcement that transgender individuals wouldnt be allowed to serve, made in a July 26 series of tweets with no input from the Department of Defense, was widely criticized by military officials , members of the armed forces and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle . Then, just after 8 p.m., the White House issued a statement that Trump had pardoned Joe Arpaio , the former sheriff of Maricopa County in Arizona. Arpaio had been found in contempt of court for violating a judges order and unlawfully detaining individuals his officers claimed might be in the country illegally. He became infamous for making inmates in his jails wear pink underwear and sleep in tents when temperatures at times topped 110 degrees. Trump and Arpaio worked together to try to disprove Barack Obama s ability to serve as president, with Arpaio leading an  investigation into the authenticity of Obamas birth certificate that Trump once praised as successful. In his statement Friday, Trump called Arpaio a worthy candidate for a Presidential pardon, the first of Trumps presidency. Trump does have the constitutional authority to issue pardons, but the timing of Arpaios pardon caused many to question Trumps priorities. Trumps pardon, given to a man widely seen as racist, came at a time when many are still criticizing the presidents response to the white supremacist protests in Charlottesville, Virginia. Trumps initial unwillingness to explicitly condemn racists was so widely panned that Trump felt a need to defend his responses in a 20-minute rant at a Phoenix rally Tuesday. And according to WTSPs Noah Pransky and CNN, Trump deliberately timed the announcement of Arpaios pardon to come Friday evening <U+2015> Arpaios lawyer found out about the pardon at 6 p.m. Eastern Friday, and the announcement wasnt made until 8 p.m. Eastern time, a full two hours later and a mere 30 minutes after Hurricane Harvey was upgraded to a Category 4 storm. Trump teased the pardon of Arpaio on Tuesday night at the Phoenix rally but said he wouldnt grant the pardon then because he didnt want to cause any controversy. Also late Friday, it was announced that Sebastian Gorka, a controversial adviser to Trump, had left his White House job. There were also reports throughout Friday afternoon that Trump was considering ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), which would strip legal work permits from hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. In any other administration, any one of these announcements could have dominated the news cycle for days. In the Trump era, however, it appears every action was taken to ensure these decisions would be buried by Saturday, when the destruction of Harvey takes over. This story has been updated to reflect the time between when Arpaios lawyer found out about the pardon and when the White House announced it.",1,46.4,12.9,14,816,33,"While Americans Focus On A Category 4 Hurricane, Trump Does His Dirty Work",2017-08-25 22:40:00,"Paige Lavender","Politics","@health_adhd,@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_gad,@health_hiv,@health_ibs,@health_models,@health_pain,@team_us_news_ga,daca,donald-trump,hurricane-harvey,joe-arpaio,presidential-pardon,sebastian-gorka,texas,texas-gulf-coast,transgender-military,type: news,us-news",367766,338257,367766,239530,37704,128674,1.07,1.136,1.344,1.47,76088,257983,33695,15363,110165,10234,26660,190746,186315,3655,14,86,33065,32688,180,30,167,"While Americans Focus On A Category 4 Hurricane, Trump Does His Dirty Work",2017-08-25 22:40:00,"Paige Lavender","Politics","@health_adhd,@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_gad,@health_hiv,@health_ibs,@health_models,@health_pain,@team_us_news_ga,daca,donald-trump,hurricane-harvey,joe-arpaio,presidential-pardon,sebastian-gorka,texas,texas-gulf-coast,transgender-military,type: news,us-news",367766,338257,367766,239530,37704,128674,1.07,1.136,1.344,1.47,76088,257983,33695,15363,110165,10234,26660,190746,186315,3655,14,86,33065,32688,180,30,167

The move comes three days after Congress allowed a federal childrens health program to expire, potentially leaving millions of poor children without insurance coverage. The abortion bill, which the House has passed before,would shorten the time period in which a woman can legally seek an abortion, based on the medically unsupported claim that fetuses can feel pain at 20 weeks.Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, authored an op-ed on the anti-abortion website LifeNews.com on Monday touting the legislation. All of usRepublicans, Democrats, and Independentscan agree that the government has a vested interest in protecting the rights of children, Goodlatte wrote, and that should include unborn children after 20 weeks. Yet Republicans in Congress just missed a deadline to reauthorize the Childrens Health Insurance Program, which helped states provide insurance coverage to 9 million children in low-income families. The Senate had put forth a bipartisan, 5-year bill to renew the program, but didnt schedule a vote in time,instead prioritizing legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare. The House never even proposed a bill to reauthorize CHIP, which expired at the end of September. Republican gridlock has put 9 million children at risk, Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y) tweeted on Sunday . This is unacceptable. Democrats also pointed out the hypocrisy of Congress and the president doing nothing to address gun violence, which claimed 12,000 American lives this year alone. The abortion vote comes a day after the deadliest mass shooting in modern United States history, in which a man with at least 20 rifles and hundreds of rounds of ammunition opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas. There have been 521 mass shootings in this country in 477 days , and the U.S. has a far bigger gun violence problem than any other developed nation, but the 26 bills in Congress that would address gun violence in different ways are all currently languishing without a vote. If we had an outbreak every day that had over 100,000 people a year killed and injured, Congress would be in a frenzy, Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) said on the House floor Tuesday morning. Yesterday we found two minutes for a moment of silence, and we moved on. Meanwhile, bodies are accumulating in morgues in Puerto Rico as the Trump administration lags in its response to the Hurricane Maria disaster. Officials in Puerto Rico have not updated the death toll from the storm in the past week, but people are reporting horrific conditions on the ground <U+2015> hospitals running out of fuel and supplies, cancer patients missing chemotherapy treatments, mothers begging for water for their babies. Its tantamount to Mother Natures atomic bomb, and were doing very little, said Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-N.M.), who chairs the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, in asking her colleagues to expedite aid to the U.S. territory last week. Trump criticized Puerto Ricans for not doing more to help themselves after the devastating hurricane and lamented the logistical challenges of providing aid to the island. But the White House applauded House lawmakers for acting on abortion. The Administration strongly supports the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, and applauds the House of Representatives for continuing its efforts to secure critical pro-life protections, the White House said in a statement on Monday night. The legislation passed the House by a 237-189 vote, but it is very unlikely to become law because it lacks the needed 60 votes to make it through the Senate. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said Tuesday that the bill is dead on arrival and excoriated her colleagues across the aisle for prioritizing it. Is the House working on helping families who have lost their loved ones and livelihoods in Puerto Rico? No, she said. Are they answering the calls from moms and dads nationwide who want to know when Congress will finally act on gun control? No. There is never a good time for politicians to try to tell women what they can and cant do with their own bodies, she added. But the House Republican decision to prioritize politics right now  of all times  is irresponsible and out of touch to a new extreme.",1,52.7,10.5,12.2,720,39,"House Passes An Abortion Ban After Letting Children's Health Program Expire",2017-10-03 13:28:00,"Laura Bassett","Politics","@ads_scary,@bustournewsletter,@health_adhd,@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_gad,@health_hiv,@health_ibs,@health_models,@health_pain,@team_us_news_national_beats,abortion,house-of-representatives,hurricane-maria,public-health,puerto-rico,republican-politics,state-childrens-health-insurance-program,type: news,us-congressional-elections,us-news,white-house,womens-rights",367647,338011,367647,127278,40947,78449,1.085,1.155,1.002,1.075,65700,279115,22832,4183,35204,1271,15580,294376,292509,1785,25,20,269375,268631,477,168,99,"House Passes An Abortion Ban After Letting Children's Health Program Expire",2017-10-03 13:28:00,"Laura Bassett","Politics","@ads_scary,@bustournewsletter,@health_adhd,@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_gad,@health_hiv,@health_ibs,@health_models,@health_pain,@team_us_news_national_beats,abortion,house-of-representatives,hurricane-maria,public-health,puerto-rico,republican-politics,state-childrens-health-insurance-program,type: news,us-congressional-elections,us-news,white-house,womens-rights",367647,338011,367647,127278,40947,78449,1.085,1.155,1.002,1.075,65700,279115,22832,4183,35204,1271,15580,294376,292509,1785,25,20,269375,268631,477,168,99

Akhmetshin said Veselnitskaya brought a folder full of documents, which he said she left behind after the meeting. The documents detailed the Democratic National Committees finances and funding sources, some of which Veselnitskaya described as unlawful, Akhmetshin told the AP.

If the files Akhmetshin said were left in Trump Jr.s office and those released by Guccifer 2.0 are the same, it would apparently show an information pipeline flowing from Russian intelligence to the Trump campaign.

In an interview with NBC News this week, Veselnitskaya specifically addressed <U+2015> then ruled out <U+2015> any possibility that she provided Trump Jr. with records about DNC finances.

Democrat Doug Jones shocking Senate victory over accused child predator Roy Moore prompted a wave of GOP recriminations against Bannon, a former White House strategist who has targeted the GOP establishment over what he views as insufficient support of the president. You have to nominate people who can actually win. Winners make policy, and losers go home, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in October, after reports surfaced that Bannon was attempting to recruit Trump-friendly candidates to challenge GOP Senate incumbents across the country. Bannon was one of Moores earliest supporters,backing him over Trumps preferred candidate in the Republican primary, Sen. Luther Strange, who was appointed to fill the seat vacated by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions .Bannon even doubled down on Moore after a number of women came forward to accuse him of preying on them while they were teenage girls and he was an assistant district attorney in his 30s. Bannons critics quickly seized on Moores stunning loss Tuesday in crimson red Alabama <U+2015> a state Trump carried in last years presidential election by nearly 30 points <U+2015> as evidence of Bannons political incompetence. This is a brutal reminder that candidate quality matters regardless of where you are running, said Steve Law, president of the Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC aligned with McConnell. Not only did Steve Bannon cost us a critical Senate seat in one of the most Republican states in the country, but he also dragged the President of the United States into his fiasco. Josh Holmes, a former chief of staff to McConnell, tweeted, Id just like to thank Steve Bannon for showing us how to lose the reddest state in the union. Republican strategist Matt Mackowiak piled on , adding that Bannon had achieved more for the Democratic Party in one month than half of the Democrats in the U.S. Senate in a lifetime. Conservative media figures quickly chimed in, blaming Bannon for Tuesdays result. Ca[n] we stop now with the Bannon is a masterful strategist nonsense? Ive never seen such descriptions used more and deserved less, tweeted conservative radio host Dana Loesch. David French, a senior fellow at the National Review Institute, tweeted, Heckuva job Steve. While Jones bested Moore by about 20,000 votes late Tuesday,the former Alabama Supreme Court justice refused to concede defeat ,adding that he would seek a recount. GOP strategist Doug Heye lamented Tuesdays result as entirely avoidable because Republicans could have chosen an incumbent senator who would have easily won re-election.

13,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-fitness-for-office_us_599d92d6e4b0a296083b76a7","Members of a CNN panel on Tuesday openly questioned whether President Donald Trump is mentally fit for office after he held a boisterous and unrestrained rally in Phoenix. The rally was wild , even by Trumps standards. He accused the media of trying to take away our history, our heritage, and threatened to shut down the federal government in order to get funding for a wall between the United States and Mexico. CNN commentators said it was difficult to watch Trump speak and not question whether he was fit for office. They discussed the 25th Amendment , which allows for the vice president to initiate a process by which the president can be removed from office if his Cabinet deems him to be unfit. There was no sanity there. He was like a child blaming a sibling on something else, CNNs Don Lemon said immediately after the rally. A man clearly wounded by the rational people who are abandoning him in droves, meaning those business people and the people in Washington now who are questioning his fitness for office and whether he is stable. David Chalian, CNNs political director, said Trump was totally unhinged during the speech. Rick Wilson, a conservative pundit, went even further. It was an astounding chain of lies tied together by lunatic asides by a man who obviously is mentally unstable. I mean, Im not joking about it or being a smartass; this is a man who is not well, Wilson said. This is a man who is not qualified or mentally or morally fit to be the president of the United States and tonight was one more proof of it. He alternated between being a whiny 6-year-old whos had his Nintendo taken away and between being the cranky old man whos being out there condemning everyone who doesnt worship him adequately, he added. I know the 25th Amendment is a remote possibility, but if people around him dont think this guy is absolutely batcrap crazy, they are mistaken. Carl Bernstein, one of the journalists who helped uncover the Watergate scandal, said Sunday during an appearance on CNNs Reliable Sources that reporters needed to ask more questions about Trumps ability to be president. Even among Washingtons heated rhetoric, its unusual for pundits and journalists to comment on someones mental state. But Trumps erratic behavior has pushed boundaries , leading many to speculate on his fitness for office. The American Psychoanalytic Association has offered ethical guidance to members for decades,typically telling them to refrain from weighing in on the psychological state of public figures. But in July, the organization encouraged members to publicly offer behavioral analysis if they wanted. Maria Cardona, a CNN political contributor, said Tuesday that Trump might be psychotically demented. I do believe that after tonight a lot of people are going to be thinking that hes not just completely unfit, that hes just completely ill-equipped to hold this office but that he might be psychotically demented and ill of the mind in order to take this office and in order to continue with this office, she said. Lawmakers have also questioned Trumps competence. The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful. And we need for him to be successful, our nation needs for him to be successful, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) told reporters last week. Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) has called for Trump to be removed from office using the 25th Amendment . Rep.

However, he quickly veered from his prepared remarks and proceeded to hit many of his favorite rallying points to press his own agenda.

It was the only group selected for a grant that focused exclusively on fighting white supremacy.But the grant money was not immediately disbursed. Trump aides, including Katharine Gorka, a controversial national security analyst known for her anti-Muslim rhetoric, were already working toward eliminating Life After Hates grant and to direct all funding toward fighting what the president has described as radical Islamic terrorism. In December, Gorka, then a member of Trumps transition team, met with George Selim,the DHS official who headed the Countering Violent Extremism program until he resigned last month, and his then-deputy, David Gersten. Gorka told Selim and Gersten she didnt agree with the Obama administrations approach to countering violent extremism <U+2015> particularly the way the administration had described the threat of extremism, according to Nate Snyder, an Obama administration DHS counterterrorism official who was an adviser on Countering Violent Extremism efforts and was given a readout of the meeting.The Trump administration has repeatedly criticized the previous administration for avoiding terms like radical Islam out of concern that it could alienate Muslims in the U.S. and abroad. That was sort of foreshadowing what was going to come,Snyder said of the December meeting. Gorka and Selim did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Katharine Gorka has been integral in helping the Department broaden efforts to focus on all forms of extremism. Her work includes efforts to address everything from global jihadists threats to domestic terrorists, Anna Franko, a DHS spokeswoman, wrote in an email. Gorka and her husband, Sebastian Gorka, also a Trump White House official, have collaborated on numerous writings about the threat of radical Islam. Though they have a large following within far-right circles <U+2015> they both have bylines at Breitbart News <U+2015> mainstream national security experts are either unfamiliar with or critical of their work. The day after Trump won the election, Sebastian Gorka said , I predict with absolute certitude, the jettisoning of concepts such as CVE. Once Trump entered the White House in January, the office of then-DHS Secretary John Kelly ordered a full review of the Countering Violent Extremism program. Kellys office wanted to re-vet the groups receiving a portion of the $10 million Congress had appropriated for the program  even though DHS had already publicly announced the grant recipients. While that review was underway, DHS and the FBI warned in an internal intelligence bulletin of the threat posed by white supremacy. White supremacists were responsible for 49 homicides in 26 attacks from 2000 to 2016  more than any other domestic extremist movement, the two agencies wrote in a May 10 document obtained by Foreign Policy . Members of the white supremacist movement likely will continue to pose a threat of lethal violence over the next year, they concluded. Staffers in the Countering Violent Extremism program have long pushed for it to address threats from domestic terrorists, including white supremacists. But when DHS published a new list of award recipients on June 23, there was no mention of Life After Hate. DHS also revoked funding from the Muslim Public Affairs Council, an American Muslim advocacy organization that was told in January it would receive a $393,800 grant to create community resource centers throughout the country. After publishing its new list of grantees, DHS told Muslim Public Affairs Council that it was now prioritizing organizations that worked with law enforcement. The money that was initially set aside for community-based groups like Muslim Public Affairs Council and Life After Hate will now go to several law enforcement agencies. Is this really just a front for targeting the Muslim community? asked Omar Noureldin, Muslim Public Affairs Councils vice president. Noureldin is now looking into whether the Trump administrations use of the Countering Violent Extremism programs funds violates congressional appropriation intent. Less than two months after DHS announced it was pulling funding from Life After Hate, James Alex Fields Jr., a 20-year-old Ohioan, traveled to Charlottesville, Virginia, to join white supremacists armed with long guns , waving Nazi and Confederate flags and protesting the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a local park. Fields is now accused of ramming a Dodge Challenger into a crowd of pedestrians on Saturday, and has since been charged with second-degree murder for the death of 32-year-old counterprotester Heather Heyer. Dozens of others were injured, and two Virginia state troopers died in a helicopter crash while monitoring the violent demonstration. Life After Hate was founded by former white supremacists who have renounced the racist ideology and who now help others transition out of hate groups and re-assimilate into society. Christian Piccolini, a former neo-Nazi and a co-founder of the group, told NPR on Sunday he was not surprised by the devastation in Charlottesville. The white supremacy movement has been growing, but its also been shape-shifting, Piccolini said. Its gone from what we would have considered very open neo-Nazis and skinheads and KKK marching, to now people that look like our neighbors, our doctors, our teachers, our mechanics. And its certainly starting to embolden them, because a lot of the rhetoric thats coming out of the White House today is so similar to what we preached ... but in a slightly more palatable way, he added. As the violence in Charlottesville unfolded on Saturday, Trump condemned this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence, on many sides, adding that the problem existed during the Obama administration. The president ignored several calls to specifically denounce white supremacists and neo-Nazis who said they were working to fulfill Trumps campaign promises. It wasnt until Monday, two days after the violent rally, that Trump specifically denounced the [Ku Klux Klan], neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups. Trumps hesitancy to disavow white supremacists echoes his practice of repeatedly dodging questions about David Duke, a former KKK grand wizard who supported Trump, during the 2016 presidential campaign. Facing public pressure, Trump eventually distanced himself from the infamous white supremacist. Now in the White House, Trump has surrounded himself with an array of people tied to white supremacist, anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant groups. Katharine Gorka, now an adviser in the Department of Homeland Securitys policy office, has pushed conspiracy theories about the Muslim Brotherhood infiltrating the government and media. Sebastian Gorka is a deputy assistant to the president and has described Islam as an inherently violent religion. He argued days before the Charlottesville attack that white supremacy is not the problem facing the country. Stephen Miller , Trumps speechwriter and policy adviser, has blamed the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks on poor immigration enforcement, and accused black students of racial paranoia. National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton wrote under a pseudonym that Islam is incompatible with the modern West, and that diversity is a source of weakness, tension, and disunion. And Trump himself campaigned for president on the platform of banning Muslims from traveling to the U.S. and building a wall to keep Mexicans out <U+2015> proposals that won him enthusiastic support from white supremacists. DHS did not directly respond to a questions about why it cut funding for de-radicalizing neo-Nazis, and whether it views white supremacy as an extremist threat. Sixteen of the 26 groups that received DHS funding have applicability to all forms of violent extremism and as such will address the threat of domestic terrorism, Franko, the DHS spokeswoman, wrote. America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know whats going on. Tell us your story .

Speaking to Ali Velshi and Stephanie Ruhle on Wednesday, lawyer Trenton Garmon claimed multiple women alleging Moore attempted to groom them as children <U+2015>including one who says Moore sexually assaulted her <U+2015> were instead false witnesses. Based on what Ive seen, facts out there now, theres questions about the validity of the witnesses statements, Garmon said. Theres issues about mental health weve not yet had the opportunity to get into. In a clip played by MSNBC, Fox News anchor Sean Hannity asked Moore if he would remember dating girls as young as 17. Moore responded no, but that he would not dispute the claims. If Roy Moore doesnt remember, why would he say its false? Ruhle asked the lawyer. And why would he need permission from these girls mothers if theyre not underage? Garman fumbled for an answer. Culturally speaking, obviously theres differences, Garmon started. I looked up Alis background there, wow, thats awesome that you have got such a diverse background <U+2015> its really cool to read. Velshi and Ruhle both appeared perplexed. What does Alis background have to do with dating a 14-year-old? Ruhle responded. Please answer: What does Ali Velshis background have do with dating 14-year-old girls? In other countries, theres arrangements through parents for what we would refer to as consensual marriage, Garmon said. Ali is from Canada, Ruhle said. I dont know where youre going with this, Trenton, Velshi said. Garmon continued to fumble his responses, leading Ruhle to another line of questioning. You have young daughters, she told Garmon. If your daughter was 14, would you think its appropriate that she date a man in his 30s? Would you think it was normal that a random man sign her yearbook? I would say no, Garmon said. If someone came to me like what was postulated there and said, May I date your daughter <U+2015> dont know her age <U+2015> I would say no. Garmon confirmed he would continue to support the senate candidate. From who I know in Roy Moore, I know no better man, he said. I know a lot of good men, a lot of good women.

18,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jared-kushner-trump-alabama_us_59ccea6fe4b0210dfdfc60ea","Once again,President Donald Trump finds himself in trouble after taking political advice from his son-in-law. Over the last few months, Jared Kushner , who is also a White House senior adviser, was chief among those who lobbied the president to endorse Luther Strange, the losing candidate in Tuesdays Republican Senate primary in Alabama. According to two sources who work closely with the young real estate tycoon, Kushner suggested the endorsement, in part, because he believed that a Strange victory would enrage Steve Bannon , the newly reinstalled executive chairman of Breitbart News and a nemesis of Kushners from their time together in the Trump White House. Bannon backed the primary winner, Roy Moore,who thinks that homosexuality should be criminalized and suggested this week that parts of the United States are operating under Sharia. Kushner also thought that getting Trump to support Strange would improve his own tenuous standing with Republican leaders in the Senate, according to several allies of Bannon. Hes going to need them if things go south in the Russia investigation, one explained. The senatorial primary between Strange and Moore was widely viewed as a proxy war between the Republican Partys establishment forces and its white nationalist fringe. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the Senate majority leader, strongly supported Strange. Bannon, on the other hand, suggested at a rally for Moore on Monday that a reckoning is coming not just for McConnell, but for all the donors and corporatists he believes run the party. That Trump ultimately supported Strange , tweeting on his behalf and attending a campaign event for him last week, was puzzling to many of the presidents supporters, given his strained relationship with McConnell and his sympathies for Bannons populist worldview. Presidents rarely endorse one candidate over another in a primary election. But Kushner was a critical early voice in convincing the president to take a side. McConnell and Rick Dearborn, the White House deputy chief of staff, also were instrumental at various points in the process. Sources close to Bannon noted that Trump first tweeted about Strange on Aug. 8 , when Kushner was with the president at his country club in Bedminster, New Jersey. No senior adviser to the president in their right mind would ever lead the president to get involved in a primary, let alone a highly contested one that pitted his own base against him, said Sam Nunberg, a former adviser to Trump <U+2015> and a close friend of Bannons. Anyone with a pulse knew that Luther was going to lose the runoff. Luther barely survived the primary. The president hadnt paid attention to the race until recently. According to three sources with direct knowledge, when Moore emerged victorious in the three-candidate first round of voting last month, winning 39 percent, Trump asked confidants: Whos he? Kushner started advocating for Trump to back Strange after speaking with veteran Republican strategist Jeff Roe. Roe, who is friendly with Kushner, ran Sen. Ted Cruzs (R-Texas) presidential campaign in 2016 and was hired by Strange earlier this year. Roe sent Kushner emails loaded with polling data that suggested Strange would win easily over Moore and the third candidate in Augusts primary election, Rep. Mo Brooks. Kushner forwarded those emails to appropriate parties, a White House official said. Kushner was also alerted to the fact that Brooks had called Trump a serial adulterer during the 2016 primary, when Brooks was supporting Cruz. Trump, several sources say, had no idea that Brooks disparaged him until Kushner passed along the news, and it sunk any chances of Trump endorsing him. (The White House official denied this, saying Kushner never spoke about Brooks or the Alabama race to the president.) Backing Strange, then, seemed like an obvious choice to Kushner. Several sources close to both Moore and Bannon said they believe Kushner wanted to show McConnell that he had real influence with the president <U+2015> and that he wanted to show Trump he knew how to win. All Jared thinks about is beating Bannon, said a well-connected friend of the Breitbart chief. It consumed him before Bannon left the White House, and it consumes him now. That sentiment was confirmed to me by a source who knows Kushner well and has a more positive view of him. (The White House official dismissed the anti-Bannon notion as totally untrue.) But Kushner misread the mood of Alabama Republicans. Moore won this weeks race by 10 percentage points. And shortly thereafter, ProPublica discovered that Trump had deleted his previous tweets supporting Strange. According to CNN, Trump went to bed on Tuesday night embarrassed and pissed. Breitbart wasted little time in highlighting Kushners awful advice. An article Wednesday noted that Kushner has a disturbing pattern of getting the president in trouble, referencing Kushners suggestion that Trump fire former FBI director James Comey. This time, according to Breitbart , Kushner stands accused of dividing Trump from his base. He has succeeded in doing the only thing that could be fatal to Trumps presidency and re-election prospects  driven a wedge between the president and his supporters. Whats clear, explained someone who has good relations with both Bannon and Kushner, is that the feud between the two of them shows no signs of dying down<U+2015> and that Bannons side will offer little grace in victory. Kushner wants to show Trump he is the smarter of the two, but it is not working, said a friend of Bannons. Two sources confirmed that Trump told confidants Tuesday night that while he is not pleased that Bannons candidate won, he is not upset at his former strategic adviser.

Mueller, who is leading the Justice Departments investigation as special prosecutor, is a former FBI director, which critics say creates a conflict of interest in the case. He also previously worked with former FBI director James Comey, who President Donald Trump fired in May amid the agencys investigation into Russian interference. David N. Kelley, Comeys attorney,has disputed Trumps claim that Comey and Mueller were close friends, maintaining that the pair were friends in the sense that co-workers are friends. The GOP has long complained about Muellers supposed lack of objectivity. But this week, demands urging him to quit escalated in the wake of reports that the Democratic National Convention and the Hillary Clinton campaign funded opposition research that turned up a secret dossier on Trump and his alleged Russia ties. On Thursday the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal <U+2015> a crown jewel in the media empire of Rupert Murdoch, a close Trump ally  went after Mueller as well. It wrote that the dossier news raises the question of whether the document helped fuel the FBIs probe into Trumps campaign. Since the dossier attributes allegations to Kremlin-connected sources, the board argues that would mean the FBI could have been essentially acting on disinformation provided by Russia. And if there were a need to investigate the FBIs actions, that would make Muellers FBI ties a major conflict of interest. The federal code could not be clearer  Mueller is compromised by his apparent conflict of interest in being close with James Comey, Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz) said in a statement to Fox News on Friday. The appearance of a conflict is enough to put Mueller in violation of the code. Friday morning, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) said on Fox and Friends that somebody with Bob Muellers integrity should step aside. Trump has also tweeted that the FBI may have helped pay for the dossier directly, though theres no apparent evidence this is true. Meanwhile, journalist Carl Bernstein  best known for his work with Bob Woodward reporting on the Watergate scandal is accusing Trump of trying to sabotage Muellers investigation. The Russians interfered in our electoral process, and there is an investigation into whether Donald Trump and those around him had foreknowledge of those attempts, and what their relationships were with Russians, business relationships that might have made them vulnerable to Russian objectives, Bernstein said on Don Lemons CNN Tonight on Friday.

21,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-flynn-trump-russia-mueller-probe_us_5a219c0fe4b03c44072d64bc","WASHINGTON <U+2015> Former national security adviser Michael Flynn , the man President Donald Trump trusted with the nations closest-held secrets, is now a felon, admitting in federal court Friday that he lied to FBI agents just days after his former boss was sworn in as president.But its actually the relative non-severity of the charge against Flynn that should have Trump and his top aides worried. Flynn, who served as Trumps national security adviser for 24 days before he was fired for reportedly lying to Vice President Mike Pence about the content of his discussions with the Russian ambassador weeks before Trumps inauguration, had significant legal exposure. As did his son Michael Flynn Jr. So the fact that he struck a plea deal with just a single count that could potentially mean no prison time indicates hes been able to leverage significant information on an even bigger target. In short, special counsel Robert Mueller s team isnt done yet. Usually in government investigations they dont cooperate down, they cooperate up, Mark Lee , a former federal prosecutor, told HuffPost. Gen. Flynn is probably a medium-sized fish. Theyre looking for a bigger fish than him. Trump has dismissed Muellers probe as a witch hunt and a hoax, and the White House is already trying to distance the administration from Flynn .But the investigation has already resulted in two guilty pleas <U+2015> from Flynn and former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos <U+2015> as well as hefty criminal charges against Trumps former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his deputy Rick Gates. Now, armed with the cooperation of Flynn and Papadopoulos and with significant leverage against Manafort and Gates, Muellers team appears poised for another takedown. Flynn would not be permitted to enter a plea bargain unless he had substantial credible evidence of criminal activity involving high-level members of the Trump campaign, including potentially the president himself, Notre Dame Law School professor Jimmy Gurul said. Clearly this is not good news for President Trump. Two individuals specifically referenced in court documents in connection with Flynns guilty plea Friday should be particularly nervous. First, theres a senior official on the Trump transition team who was at Trumps Mar-a-Lago resort on Dec. 29. According to his statement of offense , Flynn made a call that day to a senior official who was with other senior members of the transition team at Mar-a-Lago. This was the day after the Obama administration had announced sanctions against Russia in response to Russias interference in the 2016 election and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak had contacted Flynn for a chat. In that Dec. 29 call, Flynn and other members of the Trump transition team, according to the statement of offense, discussed the U.S. Sanctions, including the potential impact of those sanctions on the incoming administrations foreign policy goals.Then, immediately after talking to the official, Flynn called the Russian ambassador and asked that Russia not escalate the situation. Fox News , CNN and ABC reported Friday that K.T. McFarland,a former top administration official Trump has nominated to become an ambassador, was the senior official in question. Second, theres the very senior member of the Presidential Transition Team who, on Dec. 22, directed Flynn to call other countries, including Russia, to learn where governments stood on a U.N. Security Council resolution on Israeli settlements. Multiple outlets have reported that this is Jared Kushner, Trumps son-in-law and adviser. Flynn, according to his statement of offense, requested that Russia either vote against or delay the resolution. Flynn admitted he lied when he told FBI agents that he asked only for their position on the vote and didnt request they take any particular action. Flynns admissions that he acted on behalf of the Trump transition team to interfere with U.S. foreign policy raises the potential of charges under the Logan Act, a never-used 1799 statute than bans citizens from interfering in foreign relations, as well as potential other criminal statutes. As part of his plea deal, Flynn has agreed to cooperate fully, truthfully, completely, and forthrightly with Muellers office or any other federal, state and local law enforcement authorities Muellers office identifies where Flynns cooperation would be relevant. Flynn also must promptly turn over any and all evidence of crimes of which hes aware.

22,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-to-end-daca-report-politico_us_59acaa61e4b0b5e530ff6e88","WASHINGTON <U+2015>President Donald Trump plans to end an Obama-era program that protects young undocumented immigrants from deportation, according to multiple reports. But the decision wouldnt take effect for six months, raising the prospect that Trump could change his mind or Congress could work on a legislative solution <U+2015> and prolonging uncertainty for hundreds of thousands of people protected by the program. On Sunday, Politico and Reuters reported that Trump plans to eventually terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which grants work permits and protections for so-called Dreamers, or undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children. There will be a six-month delay to any enforcement of the presidents decision, unnamed sources told Politico and Reuters , which would give Trump ample time to reverse his decision or decline to follow through on it. Otherwise, Congress would have to pass legislation during that gap if they want to keep protections for DACA recipients in place. Dreamers might not know for months whether or how their lives could be upended. The White House is expected to officially announce Trumps decision on Tuesday. The decision would run against the recommendation of some Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who said Friday that Trump should keep DACA in place while Congress works on a legislative solution. The program, often referred to as DACA, allows undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. before they turned 16 to apply for two-year work authorization and reprieve from deportation. Since President Barack Obama created DACA in 2012, nearly 800,000 people have been granted those protections, which meant they could obtain drivers licenses, work legally and live without the imminent threat of being returned to countries they hadnt seen since childhood. Trumps decision comes ahead of an informal Sept. 5 deadline set by state attorneys general who threatened legal action if the president did not suspend DACA by that time. But supporters of DACA, including members of Congress and immigrant rights groups, said Trump could have fought for the program in court <U+2015> or even waited to see if the states actually followed through on a legal challenge. They made a last-ditch push to persuade him to maintain DACA. Instead, the presidents decision could put those hundreds of thousands of Dreamers in limbo. Trump said repeatedly during his presidential campaign that he would end DACA <U+2015> which he argued was unconstitutional <U+2015> immediately upon becoming president. But he also spoke often about Dreamers in a vague but positive way, hinting that he favored action to support them. Last December, Trump said he would  work something out  for Dreamers. In February, he said he would  show great heart <U+2033> toward them. In April, he said Dreamers should  rest easy  because his focus was deporting criminals. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Thursday ahead of the announcement that Trump absolutely stood by his commitment to treat Dreamers with heart. The president has kept DACA going for months in spite of his previous claims that it was illegal. From January through March, during most of which he was president, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services approved nearly 125,000 people for DACA, most of them for renewal. DACA recipients have not been entirely safe, however, under the Trump administration. Immigrant rights advocates said there has been an uptick in the detention of Dreamers since the president took over and began an expansion of deportation efforts. Without DACA,all Dreamers would be at risk of deportation. Trump officials have said no individuals are exempt from removal, and have sought to deport people who merely cross their paths even if they havent otherwise committed a crime. Trump wants to deport more undocumented immigrants, and more DACA recipients will likely be among them. There could also be major economic implications. If DACA recipients are unable to renew their work permits, nearly 700,000 people who are currently employed would exit the workforce. An average of 1,400 people would lose work authorization each business day and more than 6,000 could be fired in the first week alone, according to a recent report by FWD.us and the Center for American Progress, both supporters of the program. Deporting Dreamers is not a popular move <U+2015> even among Republicans and Trump supporters, according to polling . Nearly two-thirds of all Americans support DACA,according to a NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll .That means there is a chance Congress will step in and protect Dreamers, although its not clear the White House would buy in without major concessions from Democrats on a border wall, immigration enforcement and cuts to legal immigration. Such a deal was reportedly being pushed by top White House officials, but Democrats quickly shot it down at the time, saying Dreamers should not be used as bargaining chips. The White House has not supported other bipartisan efforts to help Dreamers that dont have additional items attached, such as the stopgap Bridge Act, which would temporarily extend protections, or the Dream Act, which would put them on a path to legal status and potential citizenship. Congressional Republicans have repeatedly blocked efforts to grant legal protections to Dreamers, but will be under increased pressure to do so after Trumps announcement. Ahead of the decision, some Republican lawmakers said they planned to work on more legislation that focuses on Dreamers. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) intends to introduce what some backers are touting as a conservative version of the Dream Act, called the Recognizing Americas Children, or RAC Act, which was already introduced in the House and would grant legal status to a slightly narrower category of young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Ryan, the House speaker, said Friday he also wants to pass a bill on Dreamers. There are people in limbo, Ryan said on WCLO radio in Janesville, Wisconsin. These are kids that know no other country, who were brought here by their parents and dont know another home, and so I really do believe there needs to be a legislative solution, thats one that were working on.",1,49.86,11.6,13.4,1001,47,"Trump Reportedly To End DACA With 6-Month Delay",2017-09-03 21:38:00,"Elise Foley","Politics","@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_national_beats,donald-trump,international-news,republican-politics,type: news,us-news",358709,311576,358709,162680,33330,118083,1.12,1.106,1.057,1.054,66802,268710,23197,10348,123579,147539,16411,45787,43500,2252,2,1,33028,32849,141,13,25,"Trump Reportedly To End DACA With 6-Month Delay",2017-09-03 21:38:00,"Elise Foley","Politics","@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_national_beats,donald-trump,international-news,republican-politics,type: news,us-news",358709,311576,358709,162680,33330,118083,1.12,1.106,1.057,1.054,66802,268710,23197,10348,123579,147539,16411,45787,43500,2252,2,1,33028,32849,141,13,25

Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas during an event that was supposed to honor Native American World War II veterans. The presidents attempt at a joke was quickly condemned by politicians and Native American leaders .

25,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clinton-sanders-campaign-sexual-harassment_us_5a0dfdf2e4b045cf43705417","Lilian Adams and Zoey Jordan Salsbury were teenagers when they started working on opposite sides of the 2016 Democratic presidential primary. Adams, then 19, joined Hillary Clintons campaign and Salsbury, then 18, joined Sen. Bernie Sanders campaign.They were ready to make the world a better place by helping to elect their candidate. But each woman says she was sexually harassed by a fellow campaign worker  and that both campaigns were ill-equipped to address the allegations. Their stories show how political campaigns can prey on the same young people who power them with their work and energy. Even as Adams and Salsbury came forward to tell their stories, each requested that her alleged harasser not be named, citing safety and professional concerns. In Clintons Campaign Adams signed on to the Clinton campaign as an intern at its Brooklyn, New York, headquarters in October 2015. She wore many hats: I was on the digital organizer team and an assistant to the digital director, the deputy digital director, the chief digital officer and the [chief technical officer], she said. Seven months later, in May 2016, she relocated to Colorado to work with the state Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign as a paid organizer. Her job connected the two, promoting the former secretary of state and other Democrats on the states ballot. It was in the Colorado office that Adams said she faced harassment from a fellow organizer. Adams said she dealt with this harassment for months and mentioned it to a superior as early as June. The abuse began as homophobic remarks  Adams felt targeted, she said, because the man knew she was bisexual  and escalated from there. He made multiple comments about my body, told people we were dating, would constantly try to get me to drink (I was 19), try to force me into situations where we were alone, encouraged me not to wear bras, etc., Adams said. HuffPost reached out for comment from the individual accused of harassment but received no reply. A person Adams confided in at the time, speaking on background, confirmed her account. By August, Adams said shed lost hope that the harassment would end or that her harasser would finally back away because she wasnt interested in him. She again reached out to her superiors and asked them to take action. The campaign fired her harasser shortly thereafter. In text messages between Adams and one of her superiors, which were reviewed by HuffPost, they both expressed relief that the problem was over. But even after her abuser was fired, his work with the party  and the campaign  wasnt over. In October 2016, Adams said she discovered to her astonishment that he had been rehired the previous month to work on the campaign with a different state party. So he was technically fired but still ended up working for Hillary via the [other state] Democratic Party, said Adams. It was a disappointing turn of events, and one that left Adams deeply disillusioned. You have a lot of young passionate people who want to help change the world through Democratic politics, she said. Older Democratic operatives see this passion and exploit it, putting us in an extremely stressful and unhealthy work environment. A member of the Clinton camp, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the national campaign had no involvement in Adams abuser being hired in the other state. The official told HuffPost that it was impossible the campaign would have okayed the hire, given that the abuser was fired for sexual harassment and his name would have surfaced in its job records. Nick Merrill, who had been a spokesman for the campaign, told HuffPost that the allegations in Colorado were met with swift action. Making clear that such incidents will not be tolerated means not only preventing them in the first place, but dealing with them appropriately, Merrill said in a statement. Thats why, when the matter was brought to the attention of the campaign, the employee who committed that act was immediately terminated. Merrill added that the accused was aware of the potential consequences for his behavior. Every employee on the campaign had to undergo orientation that included sexual harassment training, Merrill said, and that was the case here. In Sanders Campaign In October 2015, Salsbury became president of American University Students for Bernie, a volunteer position. Her main point of contact in the Vermont senators campaign was an intern, another college student in Washington, D.C. When he made unwanted advances toward her, Salsbury said she didnt know where to turn because the campaign had no internal infrastructure to deal with such issues <U+2015> at least involving volunteers. The person Salsbury identified as her harasser did not respond to a request for comment. But her account was confirmed by her friend Colin Moir, a fellow member of the American University group. He had been harassing her sexually, said Moir, adding that Salsbury was not able to speak to somebody higher up and report it. Like Adams, Salsbury felt helpless to stop the harassment. There was no culture of accountability in the D.C. office of the Sanders campaign, she said, and s he didnt think people would listen to a young volunteer . It was a culture that didnt discuss office policies with volunteers or make it clear that harassment wasnt tolerated, said Salsbury. Salsbury did hear from the Sanders campaign after she posted about the incident this month on social media. A former digital media manager reached out to her this past weekend, she said, and on Monday, a Seattle-based lawyer named Bernice Johnson Blessing called her on behalf of the campaign. It firmly felt like the kind of call you make when youre trying to feel out if someone has the interest and/or standing to bring a lawsuit, said Salsbury. The conversation with the lawyer made her uncomfortable. It felt like I was being blamed, she said. She suspects that Sanders plans to run for president again in 2020 and theyre afraid of me being a roadblock to that. Blessing did not return a request for comment. Salsburys account isnt the first allegation of a toxic workplace in the Sanders campaign. Earlier this year, as he was running unsuccessfully for Congress in Californias 34th District, Arturo Carmona battled accusations of sexism and mistreatment of staff from when he was deputy political director in the Sanders campaign. Among the allegations was a charge by the campaigns former national Latino outreach strategist, Masha Mendieta, that Carmona had covered up an accusation of sexual harassment made against a volunteer surrogate in Nevada. Carmona didnt take the allegations seriously, Mendieta wrote in a Medium post . Arturo and his deputy went out drinking that night, didnt pay it another thought, and the next morning assigned two young female interns to the same surrogate we just reported, wrote Mendieta. We objected vehemently and they reassigned them amidst great sighing. Carmona categorically denied the allegations to the Los Angeles Times before the special election. He said, I have always taken issues of harassment and equity in the workplace with the seriousness and sensitivity that they deserve. In a statement to HuffPost,Sen. Sanders was adamant that he does not tolerate sexual harassment in his Senate office or on his campaigns. It is critical we listen to those sharing their stories, recognize no workplace is immune from these problems, and address them in a serious manner,he added. Sanders office told HuffPost that while his presidential campaign employees and interns would have been provided with a handbook detailing the process for reporting harassment, volunteers were not given that information. Its a policy that they plan to change in the future. I Felt Taken Advantage Of Sexual harassment is a problem in every industry. But its especially hard to fight in the world of presidential campaigns  giant enterprises that spring up in a matter of weeks and are laser-focused on a single goal: electing the candidate. The mental and emotional health of staffers is a secondary consideration, at best. As Adams and Salsburys cases illustrate, even the biggest campaigns have failed to set up and then truly promote the use of reporting structures to deal with harassment allegations. A few people spoke to me within two days of his firing, but then it was never mentioned again, Adams recalled. Despite her treatment,she doesnt blame Clinton.Adams still draws comfort from the woman she worked to get elected president. When I criticize the Hillary campaign, I am not criticizing her, said Adams. She was actually a source of inspiration during the hard days. But the entire experience soured her on electoral politics. I felt taken advantage of, she said, and neglected.

26,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/phoenix-new-times-sheriff-joe-arpaio_us_59a1787de4b06d67e337ea8a","A Phoenix weekly is taking the opportunity to remind people exactly who President Donald Trump just pardoned. Former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio , who called himself Americas toughest sheriff, was convicted of criminal contempt in July after violating a 2011 court order in a racial profiling case. Arpaio and his office had been ordered not to detain people solely because they thought they might be in the country illegally. Trump pardoned Arpaio , 85, for the contempt charge on Friday. Arpaios tenure as sheriff from 1993 through 2016 has received strong criticism from civil rights advocates, largely stemming from his extreme stance on immigration and for overseeing what they say was cruel treatment of inmates. And few know those controversies better than the Phoenix New Times, an alternative weekly thats doggedly covered Arpaio for two decades. The night that Trump pardoned him, the Phoenix New Times unleashed an eye-opening Twitter thread reminding readers of some of the grimmest stories of Arpaio and his office. The numerous tweets  which all link to previous Phoenix New Times stories  describe instances like Arpaio calling his states own jail a concentration camp, jailers breaking the neck of a paraplegic man, the failure of the sheriffs office to investigate hundreds of sex abuse cases and a botched SWAT raid in which deputies allegedly laughed as a puppy burned to death. Read the whole thread for yourself below. The Phoenix New Times is not the only paper to come out against Trumps decision. In a scathing editorial Friday, the Republic said Trumps pardon was insulting. The pardon was a slap to those who worked through the judicial system to make Arpaio accountable, too. It robbed the people hurt by his policies of justice  even before a judge could mete out a sentence. The pardon was a sign of pure contempt for every American who believes in justice, human dignity and the rule of law, the editorial board wrote. By pardoning Arpaio, Trump made it clear that institutional racism is not just OK with him. It is a goal.

27,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/george-papadopoulos-big-deal_us_59f72de7e4b077d8dfcb085b","WASHINGTON <U+2015> There may have been a brief moment Monday morning when the White House thought the week wouldnt be so bad. The federal grand jury indictment unsealed against Donald Trump s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort , and his longtime associate Rick Gates, dealt with much of their lobbying work before the 2016 election. At first glance, the indictments didnt seem to have much to do with whether Trump and his team coordinated with Russia. They could certainly be used to gain leverage over the former Trump associates, but there was no smoking gun tying the Trump campaign to Russia. But any moment of optimism would have been short-lived. Not long after Manafort and Gates were in federal custody, special counsel Robert Muellers team dropped another bombshell: Theyd flipped a former Trump campaign adviser months ago. The charges against Trumps former foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos <U+2015> a little-known, little-qualified 30-year-old who listed his involvement in Model United Nations as one of his credentials <U+2015> may end up being a much bigger part of the Russia investigation. The Papadopoulos charges, dated Oct. 5 but only unsealed on Monday, deal directly with his work during the election and his attempt to link up the Russian government with the Trump campaign. His statements also make clear that he was acting with the involvement of higher-ranking officials in Trumps orbit. The charges against Papadopoulos became public less than six months after Mueller, a former FBI director, was chosen by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to head up the Russia probe. But Papadopoulos was first arrested on July 27, when he landed at Washington Dulles International Airport on a flight from Germany. And hes been cooperating ever since. The public may only now be seeing the first fruits of Muellers investigation, but Papadopoulos has been on the hook for a while. Papadopoulos was charged with lying during an interview with the FBI back in January about his communications with Russians when he served as one of Trumps foreign policy advisers. On March 24, 2016, just days after Papadopoulos was publicly identified as one of the Trump campaigns foreign policy advisers,he met with a professor in London who had substantial connections to Russian government officials, according to the charges against him. In an interview with FBI agents this year, Papadopoulos claimed that the professor had told him the Russians had dirt on Hillary Clinton before hed joined the campaign. But that wasnt true: Papadopoulos wasnt told about the dirt and thousands of emails that the Russians had on Clinton until more than a month after he joined the campaign. Papadopoulos continued trying to arrange a meeting between the campaign and the Russian government, and he emailed a Senior Policy Advisor on the Trump campaign to tell them he had some interesting messages coming in from Moscow about a trip when the time is right. In one email, a high-ranking campaign official forwarded Papadopoulos email to another campaign official and noted the need to communicate that [Trump] is not doing these trips and that they should send someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal. The timing of when Papadopoulos found out that Russia had thousands of emails on Clinton is particularly noteworthy. Papadopoulos found out the hacked emails existed in April 2016. The leaked emails hacked from Democratic National Committee staffers accounts werent made public until July 2016. And the emails hacked from John Podesta, Clintons campaign chairman, werent released until October. That means a Trump campaign official knew something was coming from the Russian government that would damage the Clinton campaign, months before the public did. In his interview with the FBI, Papadopoulos allegedly tried to downplay his meetings with the professor with ties to Russia, calling him a nothing. In reality, Papadopoulos knew of the professors substantial connections to Russian government officials and used the professors connection to try to connect the campaign with the Russian government. The pending charges against Manafort are still significant because of the leverage they offer Mueller.Manafort, 68, could face a stiff federal prison sentence if convicted, which gives Muellers team serious leverage to convince him to fully cooperate in the probe about the campaigns connections to Russia. The White House circulated talking points Monday, asking its GOP allies to stress that Manafort is  not a part of the administration . Conservative media also downplayed the indictment, saying Manaforts problematic work was  many years before he joined Trump  and  well before  he joined the campaign. Papadopoulos is also not part of the current administration, but the three indictments together make it tougher for Trump to completely distance himself from the controversy. In the past, the Trump team has tried to write off troubling individuals as peripheral to their operation. While Papadopoulos was a low-level official, he was certainly a part of the campaign. He attended a meeting with Trump and Jeff Sessions, who later became attorney general, in March 2017. Theres even a photo of them at a table together, with Papadopoulos sitting four places to Trumps right and two places to Sessions left. Hes an energy consultant, Trump told The Washington Post of Papadopoulos in 2016.  Excellent guy . On Monday afternoon, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders downplayed Papadopoulos importance, saying his involvement with the campaign was extremely limited and that he was simply a volunteer. She said that anything Papadopoulos did was not in an official capacity on behalf of the campaign.

29,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/female-democratic-senators-call-on-al-franken-to-resign_us_5a281be8e4b0c2117627b73e","WASHINGTON <U+2015> Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) officially lost the support of many of his colleagues Wednesday, when more than 30 Democratic senators and the chairman of the Democratic National Committee called on him to step down amid multiple sexual misconduct allegations, including groping and kissing women without their consent. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who has been a leader on raising awareness about the epidemic of sexual misconduct, was the first to call on Franken to go. I have been shocked and disappointed to learn over the last few weeks that a colleague I am fond of personally has engaged in behavior towards women that is unacceptable, she said in a Facebook post . I consider Senator Franken to be a friend and have enjoyed working with him in the Senate in our shared fight to help American families. But this moment of reckoning about our friends and colleagues who have been accused of sexual misconduct is necessary, and it is painful. We must not lose sight that this watershed moment is bigger than any one industry, any one party, or any one person. Moments later, several of Gillibrands female colleagues also began calling for Frankens resignation. Im shocked and appalled by Sen. Frankens behavior. Its clear to me that this has been a deeply harmful, persistent problem and a clear pattern over a long period of time, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said in a statement. Its time for him to step aside. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)also called on Franken to resign. An aide said she had spoken to him privately and told him it was the right thing to do. Male senators , including Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) <U+2015> the caucus No. 2 member <U+2015> later followed suit. By the end of Wednesday, at least 35 of the 48 senators aligned with the Democrats had called on Franken to resign, according to The New York Times, including almost all of the partys female members in the chamber. Fellow Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D) notably did not join her colleagues in calling for Frankens resignation, and others have held off as they serve on the Ethics Committee. Senator Klobuchar personally spoke with Senator Franken this morning. As has been reported, he will be making an announcement tomorrow morning, her state director, Ben Hill, said in a statement. Eight women have now come forward with allegations that Franken sexually harassed them over the years. A tipping point for the Democratic senators was a story published Wednesday by Politico , in which a woman said Franken tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of a radio show in 2006. Franken was not yet a senator, and he reportedly told the woman that it was his right as an entertainer to kiss her. For some Democrats,the comment was uncomfortably similar to what Donald Trump said on that famous Access Hollywood tape : You know, Im automatically attracted to beautiful  I just start kissing them. Its like a magnet. Just kiss. I dont even wait. And when youre a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. There were new allegations today, and enough is enough, Gillibrand said Wednesday at a press conference on Capitol Hill. We need to draw a line in the sand. Democratic women colleagues have been in contact for quite some time regarding the path forward for Sen. Franken, a Senate Democratic aide told HuffPost. Todays action was a result of mounting frustrations over the increasing number of accusations. Another Democratic aide added that by last week, there was growing dissatisfaction with Franken within the caucus and frustration that there wasnt more happening. The conversations among members picked up Wednesday morning. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called Franken immediately after the Politico story went up and before the avalanche of tweets on Wednesday, according to a personal familiar with the conversation. He told Franken he needed to step down. Schumer reiterated his resignation request later in a meeting at his apartment, with Franken and his wife. On Wednesday afternoon, another woman revealed that Franken had groped her. Tina DuPuy wrote in The Atlantic that the incident occurred when she asked for a photo with him while attending a party for President Barack Obamas 2009 inauguration. We posed for the shot. He immediately put his hand on my waist, grabbing a handful of flesh. I froze. Then he squeezed. At least twice, DuPuy wrote. Al Frankens familiarity was inappropriate and unwanted. It was also quick; he knew exactly what he was doing. Democrats also said there was increased momentum because the new allegations came on the same day that Time magazine named the Silence Breakers its person of the year , honoring the women who have come forward and spoken out about harassment. And they couldnt credibly go after Republicans for supporting Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore <U+2015> who has been accused of sexual misconduct toward teen girls <U+2015> without trying to clean out their own house first. Gillibrand stopped short of calling for Democratic leaders to pressure Franken to resign, but said that an ongoing Senate ethics investigation is not equipped to adequately address the situation. I do not feel that he should continue to serve, she said of Franken. Everyone will make their own judgment. I hope they will make their own judgment. Frankens office said the senator will make an announcement about his political future on Thursday. Tom Perez , the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, also called on Franken to resign. Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee announced this week that it was jumping back into the Alabama Senate special election and would be giving money to Moore .

30,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anatoli-samochornov-trump-jr-russia-meeting_us_5966ac00e4b0a8d46d11f69f","WASHINGTON <U+2015> When President Donald Trumps son, son-in-law and campaign chairman met last June with a Russian lawyer theyd been told had incriminating information from the Russian government about Hillary Clinton, there were other people in the room. One of the previously unidentified attendees was Anatoli Samochornov, a Russian-born American translator who previously spent years working for the U.S. government. Samochornov would not confirm that he was in the room, citing nondisclosure agreements. But The New York Times Ken Vogel said Friday on MSNBC that Samochornov was at the June 9 meeting in Trump Tower. The interpreters mother-in-law also confirmed his attendance at the meeting to The Daily Beast . Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who met with the Trump team, had previously told the Times that an interpreter attended the meeting, but refused to name him. Veselnitskaya does not speak English, and Samochornov has worked with her several times over the past year, including around the time of the meeting with Trump Jr. The Associated Press and NBC News confirmed Friday that Veselnitskayas top U.S. lobbyist, Rinat Akhmetshin , also attended the meeting with her.Akhmetshin is a Russian-American with past ties to Russian intelligence. Samochornovs presence at the meeting is key because he appears to be the only witness to the event who does not have close ties to either the Trump campaign or the Russian government. He wouldnt tell HuffPost whether he had been contacted by investigators probing the Trump campaigns relationship with Russia. The office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller and the House and Senate intelligence committees declined to comment. Samochornov has worked as an interpreter on dozens of government assignments, including for the U.S. State Department, Defense Department, Securities and Exchange Commission and Drug Enforcement Administration, and for a G-8 foreign ministers dinner at the United Nations, according to his resume. He helped facilitate exchange programs for the Meridian International Center, a public diplomacy nonprofit that partners with the State Department between 2001 and 2016, according to the center. He has worked with periodically with the State Department as a contract interpreter for exchange programs. His wife also works for the State Department. Samochornovs rsum had been posted on his own business website. But the site was taken down after HuffPost contacted him with questions about his work with Veselnitskaya. Freelance interpreter s who work for government agencies often hold a security clearance so they can sit in on sensitive, high-level meetings, said Bradley P. Moss, a lawyer who has represented interpreters with government contracts. Interpreter s with security clearance are in high demand. Doing jobs for a foreign government or a foreign national with ties to a foreign government could make it hard, but not necessarily impossible, to obtain such clearance, Moss noted. A spokesman for the State Department told HuffPost that all interpreters and translators, as a rule, are required to hold at least a Moderate Risk Public Trust clearance. Samochornov has worked on high level [United Nations] and private sector meetings for the Secretary of State and other VIPs, according to his LinkedIn page. He did not respond to a request for comment on whether he holds a security clearance. He has also interpreted for public events on Russian politics. More recently, he volunteered his time to interpret a panel discussion about the Chechen governments crackdown on the LGBTQ community. The event was moderated by Russian-born U.S. journalist Masha Gessen, the author of a New Yorker article on the subject. He is the best interpreter in New York, hands down, Gessen said. A registered Democrat, Samochornov works with clients on all sides of American and international politics. But his own views appear to be progressive. On Facebook, he has shared clips from MSNBC host Rachel Maddows show, labeled former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and Bush-era adviser Karl Rove as losers , and posted in favor of expanded health care coverage and more restricted access to guns. When PEN, the literary and human rights organization, invited a gaggle of Russian writers critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin to New York, he became great friends with them, Gessen said. He handles internet trolls on his Facebook page with grace and aplomb. When he posted an image of himself with a French flag overlay, a sign of support for the victims of the November 2015 terror attacks in Paris, a Facebook friend criticized him for not changing his picture to include the Israeli flag after attacks in that country. Samochornov engaged in a lengthy, polite discussion of why he felt personally affected by the Paris attack because of his friends and family who live there. Samochornov has worked for Veselnitskaya since at least April 2016. At that time, she led a lobbying campaign against a U.S. law imposing sanctions on Russia for human rights abuses. The Magnitsky Act was named after Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer and accountant who uncovered corruption in Russia and later died in prison there. Veselnitskaya ran the lobbying effort from the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation, a U.S. nonprofit backed by powerful Russian oligarchs. On April 26, 2016, Samochornov sought credentials for himself and Veselnitskaya from the Open Dialog Foundation to attend a screening of a film critical of Magnitsky at the European Parliament. The next day, Veselnitskaya appeared in Brussels with Samochornov in tow. But the film did not air amid pressure from Bill Browder, a formerly Russian-based hedge fund investor and ex-Magnitsky client who was the driving force behind the sanctions legislation. When HuffPost asked Samochornov about his work for the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation, he said,  I did not have a role at Human Rights Accountability other than offering them interpreting and translation services. Samochornov also translated for Veselnitskaya when she appeared in court in New York earlier this year. The Justice Department had accused Russian businessman Denis Katsyv, one of her clients in Moscow, of laundering the proceeds of a Russian tax fraud scheme through high-end real estate assets in New York City. Veselnitskaya was not licensed to practice law in the U.S., but she assisted Katsyvs American legal team. On May 1 and May 11, a lawyer for the American law firm representing Katsyv sent memos to the U.S. district judge requesting equipment for Samochornov to use in providing simultaneous interpretation of court hearings for Veselnitskaya. Im a professional freelance interpreter and I cant talk about any of my clients, Samochornov told HuffPost. I am bound by confidentiality agreements.

With a fly boy flourish (he was a top gun long before Top Gun), hed serve a vodka tonic and head to the patio, where hed cook skinless chicken on an aircraft-carrier-size grill while listening to the Beach Boys on his boombox. Dinner was a bubbling mix of friends and family, including the McCains adopted Bangladeshi daughter, Bridget, whose dark skin engendered the racist rumors that allies of George W. Bush used to defeat the Arizona senator in the decisive 2000 Republican presidential primary in South Carolina. The Sedona McCain, and the one on the Straight Talk Express bus in the 2000 campaign, was the one the press corps came to adore. He was candid, quotable, approachable, idealistic about ending the corrupting role of money in politics and tamping down mindless ideological rigidity. He was a Reagan Republican but one who had seen war, had suffered in a Vietnamese prison for years and who emerged humane and whole. I wish I could say that it was this McCain that I saw from my perch in the Senate Press Gallery on Tuesday. But, sadly, I saw someone else: yet another victim of President Donald Trump s rampage through Constitutional democracy. Pale and wan from the ravages of brain cancer, McCain did his best to speak passionately about the desperate need to restore at least a measure of bipartisanship, of good will, of respect for institutions, for the Constitution, for the Founders and for the calming and consensus-building role of the U.S Senate, in which the Arizonan has served for 30 years. He drew applause and hugs. But the moment did not hold. For one, McCain spoke after giving Trump a crucial victory, the legislative license to begin dismantling Obamacare with no real idea of what would replace it. Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s strategy for Trump was to get on the bill and only then decide what the bill might look like, with no chance <U+2015> for arcane procedural reasons <U+2015> to slow it by filibuster. That is hardly the way the Senate is supposed to work, and McCain and everyone in the chamber knew it. Nor was the irony lost on anyone that McCain was receiving the best possible treatment at taxpayer expense and that he had flown to Washington to help enable a piece of legislation that would, in one way or another, reduce the health care coverage available to millions of Americans. The speech didnt resonate for another reason. He delivered it as a gust amid the Trump storm that is rampaging through the institutions and traditions the senator was extolling in his eloquent speech. Consider the Trump assault: The fake media. Press briefings are a joke. Regular order in Congress barely exists. The president insults and bullies his attorney general. Trumps allies talk of firing special counsel Robert Mueller, appointed by the Justice Department to investigate possible Trump ties to the Russians. The president talks trash to the Boy Scouts. He talks trash about anyone he thinks threatens him. McCain was just the latest to get run over. He is no saint, as McCain himself would ruefully admit. By the time he ran and won the presidential nomination in 2008, hed become a harder man. He did what his advisers told him, and he took as his vice presidential running mate the utterly unqualified governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. Then he sent his minions out to trash the press for objecting to the choice. But I would rather talk about the McCain at a rowdy Minnesota rally in 2008, when a woman in the crowd told him she feared candidate Barack Obama because he was an Arab and a Muslim. Obama was neither, McCain said. I have to tell you. Sen. Obama is a decent person and a person you dont have to be scared of as president of the United States, McCain said. Hes a decent family man [and] citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues, and thats what this campaigns all about. That McCain was obliterated Tuesday.

33,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-george-papadopoulos_us_59f86a2ee4b0aec1467aa951","WASHINGTON <U+2015> President Donald Trump on Tuesday downplayed the role of his former foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, calling him merely a young, low level volunteer, whom he claimed few people knew. The presidents Tuesday morning tweets were his first comments about Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about being offered dirt from the Russian government regarding Trumps 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton, according to a federal indictment unsealed Monday. Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar, Trump tweeted. Papadopoulos served on Trumps foreign policy advisory council during his campaign, a group led by then-Trump adviser Jeff Sessions, who is now attorney general. When announcing the team in March of 2016, Trump praised him as an excellent guy. The discovery that Papadopoulos had actively tried to obtain information from Russian officials came as special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into possible collusion between Trumps campaign and Russian officials during last years election made its biggest moves yet. In addition to Papadopoulos, who is now cooperating with the investigation, Muellers team also indicted Trumps former campaign manager Paul Manafort . White House officials and Trump allies have swiftly sought to distance the president from the revelations by minimizing the campaign officials involvement in Trumps campaign: a familiar  and at times, absurd  line of defense . On Tuesday, former Trump campaign adviser Michael Caputo told CNN that Papadopoulos was just a coffee boy for the campaign . When asked about a photograph showing Papadopoulos at a meeting with Trump and Sessions, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Monday dismissed it, saying that the president has thousands of photographs with millions of people. Of Manafort, who was Trumps campaign chairman, Sanders said he was brought in to lead the delegate process, which he did, and was dismissed not too long after that  omitting the time that he spent leading Trumps campaign. Trump on Tuesday reiterated that Manaforts indictment vindicated him because the conspiracy and money laundering charges against Manafort took place long before he came to the campaign. However, the indictment, which details how Manafort concealed profits from lobbying for pro-Russia groups , covers activities up to and including this year. Trump again insisted that Manaforts charges indicate no collusion, citing Manaforts lawyer. He also attacked the fake news and called for an investigation into Democrats. In a subsequent tweet, Trump attempted to divert attention from Mondays revelations by focusing on congressional Republicanspush to pass tax legislation by the end of the year. Trump seethed at Mondays news, according to The Washington Post , fuming and expressing exasperation and disgust while watching television reports about the indictments. In more tweets on Tuesday, Trump attempted to change the conversation to what he called the biggest story yesterday, Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta leaving his firm after it was implicated in Manaforts indictment , which Trump-friendly Fox News emphasized in its coverage of the story. Podestas brother is former Clinton campaign manager John Podesta.

34,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-no-longer-conservative-party_us_59767dd6e4b0e201d5776f8c","To most Americans,  conservative  is interchangeable with  Republican Party . After all, the GOP has usually been the more conservative side of a two-party system for a century. We also tend to understand who a conservative is based on the root of the word: someone who is cautious and respects the status quo, or, put more strongly, someone who is resistant to change. But the term has philosophical roots, too, separate from the party. Political parties are fundraising organizations attached to a policy platform. Over time, platforms change. The Republican Party has been around more than 160 years and has changed directions many times, as has the Democratic Party . At its founding, the GOP was abolitionist (a radical position at the time), pro-Union (that is, for big government over states rights) and for the expansion of individual rights. The GOP became firmly conservative only in the 20th century. From a European perspective, however, both U.S. parties have been conservative since World War II (that is, both are on the right end of the spectrum of most modern parliamentary democracies), and at the same time, both parties have always been liberal, as inheritors of Enlightenment notions of citizens rights, individual liberty and representative government. But gradual shifts in the GOP over the last two or three decades that culminated in Donald Trump s election in 2016 have changed all that. The GOP is no longer a conservative party in any meaningful way. It is instead something else, and it needs a more accurate description. Why should we care what European political philosophy has to say about U.S. politics? Because our politics arose out of that philosophy, and going back to those roots brings clarity. Most knowledgeable philosophical conservatives today will tell you how unhappy they are with how far the Republican Party has drifted. Some prominent conservatives leaned toward Democrats in the 2000s, such as Catholic conservative commentator Andrew Sullivan , and more have become never-Trumpers, including former Republican strategist Ana Navarro . This is because the GOP of Trump, House leader Paul Ryan and Senate leader Mitch McConnell has become a radical right. That may sound like a contradiction, since radical is usually shorthand for the far left, but the seeming contradiction demonstrates how restrictive our notion of the right-left political spectrum really is, and thats perhaps the most important thing we can learn from looking to our European roots. The Battle Between Reason And Unreason The best way to understand these roots is a historical survey of the long 19th century (from the French Revolution to World War I) and the short 20th century (encompassing both world wars and the Cold War), descriptions coined by historian Eric Hobsbawm . When I teach this period, I frame it somewhat facetiously as an epic battle between reason and unreason. In other words, the Enlightenment posed a question to Europe: What happens if we use reason (over tradition or religion) to govern ourselves? Of course, the debate was rarely that stark. Few rationalists were purely so, while proponents of the old ways pointed out how much rationality there was in tradition. Rather, I try to show students how modern European history has been a struggle between these impulses within movements as well as in opposition to each other. The French Revolution can be seen as a rousing crescendo in the symphony of support for the rationalization of government and society in Europe. It established the notion of rights, individual liberties and the primacy of the secular state. From there we can draw a line to todays liberal democracies. Both major U.S. parties and most of postwar Western politics have been in this tradition until very recently. But the two centuries following the French Revolution were filled with jockeying over peoples reactions to the cataclysmic event, from reactionaries who wanted to turn back the clock to centrists who wanted to keep things as defined in the revolutions early stage to Jacobins, the leftist radicals who wanted to push rights still further by any means necessary. This is where our right-left spectrum comes from: three broad categories of responses to the French Revolution. Most of modern Western politics is descended from the center-left responses that accepted rights as natural and argued only about who was included, the best ways to translate political rights into liberties and to what degree. On this spectrum, any conservatism within a democracy is already a centrist position because it accepts rights and representation, though in a more limited way. The far-right position in the 19th century was known as Reaction . Reactionary religious philosophers like Joseph de Maistre prioritized Gods law over mans, arguably leaning toward theocracy. Reactionary statesmen like Klemens von Metternich primarily wanted to save or return to traditional power structures and were in this sense conservative, though their violent attempts to put down any perceived threat could be described as more paranoid than cautious. Konstantin Pobedonostsev  a statesman and tutor of the future Alexander III, Russias most reactionary tsar  made strong rational criticisms of democracy. He warned that representative government diluted power and that the press  not the people or their representatives, who have little say in what writers and editors do  had the power to make or break a democratic society. (Some members of Americas alt-right profess allegiance toward Reaction , though it can be hard to tell when they are sincere and when they are praising autocracy for the shock value.) As monarchies increasingly failed to stem the tide of Enlightenment secularism, Irish statesman Edmund Burke took de Maistres place as a figurehead for mainstream conservative philosophy. Coming from the British tradition, he accepted rights and representation but wanted them limited to a (wealthy white male) few. This was an easier position to accept in a monarchy that was already limited and had inherited the liberal philosophy of John Locke. Burke was appalled by the vulgarity of the French Revolution and yet supported American independence. Though Burkes name is most strongly associated with conservatism to this day, he was a contradictory figure who does not best exemplify the post-Revolution conservatism that dominated propertied classes in Europe and North America in the 19th century. Most mainstream conservatives were ordinary people who enjoyed some wealth and social position, and didnt question the systems they were born into. Their priority was to protect what they had. Take the example of Russian provincial nobleman Andrei Chikhachev , who inherited serfs but recognized it as a system that couldnt last. He worshiped knowledge, working to expand education for serfs, and he welcomed technological advances so long as they were introduced cautiously. Rather than fearing revolution like a reactionary, he pitied decadent, urbanized Westerners from a place of complacency with his own more orderly (and unequal) rural idyll. If Chikhachev had been born in Boston instead of rural Russia, he probably would have accepted representative government as unquestioningly as he did monarchy, because it was there. He could have been just as pious, just as cautious, just as uncritically patriotic in either system, as indeed most propertied white men were then, whether they lived in a rising democracy or a failing autocracy. The right wing, in other words, is not one thing. As it has changed over time, it has also varied greatly in degree and emphasis, and in context. There are multiple philosophical sources that inform different streams of thought, many of which end up in surprising places. There is a clear continuity from even the most liberal conservatives to extreme reactionaries ( as American political theorist Corey Robin stresses ), but there is also a meaningful difference between acceptance of representative government and social change (even if regretfully, cynically or pragmatically) and violent, organized opposition to either. The Right And the Radical What can it mean to be both right (resistant to change) and radical (pursuing extreme change)? One answer has to do with nationalism. Civic nationalism is a liberal compromise that ties voting and citizenship to the nation and state order, as in the modern U.S. or Britain. Ethnic nationalism, in contrast, offers as natural and timeless something that was constructed in the middle of the 19th century. To build a tribal identity around ethnicity, language, history and religion  and use that identity to justify a state (as opposed to a monarchy justified by God)  was new . Germany is a tragic example of ethnic nationalism run amok. As foreign minister of Prussia in the mid-19th century, Otto von Bismarck added the element of nationalism to the drive for power he inherited from Metternich. Bismarck asserted that German speakers, then spread across principalities and empires, should be united into one German state. He achieved the unification of what we know as Germany in 1871, then acquired overseas colonies and helped perpetuate an arms race with Britain, leading to World War I. The militarization of Germanys government in this period, along with colonial atrocities, such as the Herero genocide ,chillingly presaged the Holocaust before ever Adolf Hitler was rejected from art college. Nationalism took its strong and ugly grip on Europe during a period of industrialization, expansion of middle classes and the entrenchment of large, bureaucratic governments that consolidated the principles of the French Revolution despite reactionary challenges (the long 19 th century). Property-owning men increasingly wielded power and accumulated wealth through professions, business and government more than inheritance. But working classes and minorities saw their conditions deteriorate with few gains in political representation. Socialism, developing in response to industrialization, recognized that the liberal focus on rights and the free market was liberating only for some. This led to the idea that only economic equality could bring real liberty <U+2015> an idea that terrified the haves and intrigued the have-nots. Nationalism emerged as a story that could unite whole populations regardless of vast disparities in wealth. And by defining us, nationalism also defines who is the other, providing someone to blame who is coincidentally not the people enjoying power and wealth. A system that was threatened by the poor and minorities told the poor to hate minorities, leaving minorities to fear the poor. Nationalism called to our irrational impulses to assuage wrongs brought by (rational) technology and economics. By the 20th century, technocratic, largely secular nationalists used both pseudo-science and appeals to tradition to promote a genocidal agenda to aggrandize their own tribe (Nazism was one variant of fascism). Other fascists in Romania, Croatia, Portugal and elsewhere were explicitly religious and allied themselves wholly with the counter-Enlightenment, harnessing fears of change and difference to unite their nations. These political religions are another subtle variation on theocracy. Where liberal democracy focuses on equal rights and opportunities for individuals to do what they want, short of imposing on others rights, socialism focuses on harnessing the productivity of all for the benefit of all, a collectivist perspective. Nationalism is also inherently collectivist because the nation is held above its component parts: the people. The core idea all fascists had in common was the supremacy of the nation over the lives or liberty of its citizens, as well as their nations superiority over others. The Nazi use of socialist in the full form of its party name, National Socialists, implied this collectivism but, by adding national, rejected everything else about socialism that made it socialism: its aim of economic equality without regard to divisions by ethnicity or religion. This appealed to voters who might have been tempted by the economic promise of socialism but recoiled from its rejection of their identity and traditional values. Fascism And The Right-Wing Fringe So, was fascism conservative? It had its roots in right-wing movements and appealed to counter-Enlightenment, reactionary values, albeit with a veneer of scientific-sounding rhetoric. It violently opposed both liberal democracy and socialism and strongly favored social hierarchy (inequality defined by race). But fascism was also radical because it embraced a strong bureaucratic government rather than inheritance as the basis for power and embraced technological progress (for its military and economic advantages). Therefore, it was not reactionary, unless we use that term so loosely it no longer defines the people it was coined to describe. But fascism also cannot be called conservative without losing that terms original meaning, since it sought drastic changes by means so vulgar as to be unimaginable to conservatives like Burke. So fascism was both right-wing and radical. In other words, the left versus right terms we use to describe our politics (and the political compass variation on it) fail to take into account one of the most important political debates of the 20th century: individualism versus collectivism, with nationalism as the key concept within that debate. Those of us born to the Anglo-American tradition often miss this because our experience is of the seemingly easy compromise position of civic nationalism. But 2016 has forced Americans to pay attention to virulent nationalism and everything that goes with it. America has always had a resentful, white-supremacist nationalism based on hating the other and rejecting liberalism. What changed in 2016 is that a major party embraced this fringe, handed it power and is now refusing to check that power with anything more than a furrowed brow. Whether motivated by cynicism, greed, fear, delusion, helplessness or true belief, by its inaction the Republican Party has abandoned the last vestiges of a conservatism that is skeptical of change, values individual liberty and accepts the premise of representative government. This Republican Party is a radical right containing elements of theocracy (Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and the evangelical base ) and fascism (the extreme alt-right, who remain unrenounced by the president and who are represented in the White House by Chief Strategist Steve Bannon ). Clearly the old schemas <U+2015> always imperfect <U+2015> cannot capture the tectonic shift in American politics institutionalized by Trumps election. They are products of the Industrial Age, and so one way to begin mapping our new landscape is to consider how the current information revolution should be central to our understanding of todays politics. We could start by appropriating the name Know-Nothings for the modern Republican Party, since its characterized by its denial of reality (the original Know-Nothings, who took their name from their secrecy, were anti-immigrant nativists). This term highlights a peculiarly postmodern twist this radical right has put on the big lie propaganda that Hitler famously recommended. Alternative facts dont just offer an unsubstantiated, and often absurd, narrative; they destabilize the idea that truth exists or matters. Political lying is nothing new, and even lying on this scale has precedents (though only in the worst regimes). Todays right goes a step further to undermine the value of any knowledge, education or evidence, for a receptive audience that cares only whether the script plays to their teams advantage or serves as a strike against the other team. An Anti-Government Government Liberals and conservatives , in the proper sense of those words, are now both uncomfortably covered by the shade of the never-Trump tent. Both accept the premise of rights and representative government, and watch in horror as norms are flouted daily. A party that used to represent limited government encroachment on individual lives moved <U+2015> through a religiously motivated drive to control womens bodies <U+2015> into a new present, where the president, Cabinet and Congress explicitly oppose the government they run in every respect but their personal domination of it. Their voting base <U+2015> largely white and evangelical <U+2015> cheer the undermining of democracy through voting restrictions and boo defenses of traditional American values, such as freedom of the press, separation of church and state, the right to protest, and checks and balances. These elected officials and their base voters are not conservatives in any sense that doesnt warp the term beyond recognition. They are a radical right that recalls earlier radical right movements such as reactionaries, fascists and theocrats. But they are also a new phenomenon. They were elevated to power through hacking, bots, gerrymandering, voter suppression and PACs. The information revolution made it possible for the least knowledgeable and yet most extreme to push themselves to power to dismantle government from within, despite losing the popular vote and continuing strong popular opposition. We will need new words to describe this, as it continues to develop in unpredictable ways.

35,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-parliamentarian-byrd-rule-health-care_us_59727d12e4b00e4363df9867","WASHINGTON Efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act ran into big trouble on Friday afternoon, when the Senate parliamentarian ruled that nearly a dozen key provisions of GOP repeal legislation violate special procedural rules that Republicans are using to pass their bill. The list of provisions includes a clause, which many conservatives consider essential, that would defund Planned Parenthood and block federal money from helping to pay for insurance policies that cover abortion. Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough also ruled out a six-month lockout period for people trying to buy insurance after they have let it lapse <U+2015> a key policy feature of the Senate bill that insurers say is vital to keeping markets stable. In the ruling, a summary of which the office of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) posted, the parliamentarians office indicated that it would still be reviewing other parts of the Senate proposal <U+2015> including provisions that would allow insurers more flexibility to vary premiums by age or to offer plans that leave out benefits such as mental health and maternity care that current law considers essential. And the parliamentarian hasnt even had a chance to consider a new amendment, proposed by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), that would allow insurers to offer some plans not subject to rules guaranteeing coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. Politically, the biggest blow for Republicans is the ruling that a provision prohibiting funds from being used to purchase insurance policies that cover abortion. That rider was key to House conservatives accepting their version of the legislation, and Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows suggested that, without that prohibition, the bill could not pass the House on the way back from the Senate. The elimination of the Planned Parenthood [funding prohibition] is very puzzling since it passed the parliamentarians scrutiny in the past, Meadows told HuffPost Friday afternoon, but todays ruling as it relates to the life issue will make passage almost impossible. The ruling matters because Republicans are trying to pass legislation through the budget reconciliation process, a special procedure in which measures are not subject to a filibuster in the Senate. That makes it possible to pass a bill with just 50 senators rather than 60, with the vice president breaking the tie <U+2015> something essential for Republicans, because they have only 52 seats and are not trying to pass their bill with Democratic support. But if reconciliation makes it possible to pass a bill with fewer votes, it also imposes strict rules on what a bill may include. Legislation must have a significant economic impact and cannot merely change policy <U+2015> otherwise it is subject to 60 votes. (This is called the Byrd Rule, named after former Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia.) The parliamentarian is the one who interprets rules. If the parliamentarian decides a provision does not conform to the guidelines for reconciliation, Democrats can (and surely would) demand that the provisions be subject to normal voting procedures <U+2015> in other words, subject to a filibuster that would require 60 votes to overcome. The parliamentarians decision today proves once again that the process Republicans have undertaken to repeal the Affordable Care Act and throw 22 million Americans off of health insurance is a disaster, said Sanders, who is ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee. The parliamentarians ruling is not the end of the story.Republicans could modify language in their bill, in the hope that with some small tweaks it would pass muster. Or they could decide to vote on legislation other than the Better Care Reconciliation Act, which is the bill GOP leaders submitted for consideration. Additionally,the parliamentarian isnt the final arbiter of what the Senate may consider in reconciliation. Its the presiding officer, who in this case would likely be Vice President Mike Pence. The presiding officer could simply ignore the parliamentarians guidance <U+2015> a move that conservatives like Cruz have suggested Republicans consider, even though it would flout Senate traditions and other Republicans have hinted they would not support it.",1,37.13,14.4,15.4,664,26,"Senate Referee Rejects Key Pieces Of Repeal Bill, Dealing Major Blow To GOP",2017-07-21 18:34:00,"Jonathan Cohn,Laura Bassett,Matt Fuller","Politics","@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_national_beats,health-care-reform,legal-issues,parliamentarian,parliamentarian-of-the-united-states-senate,political-science,senate,type: news,us-government-resources,us-news,us-presidential-elections",347165,301850,347165,478689,42323,217218,1.076,1.137,1.388,1.879,149926,149045,48194,9022,223491,8525,30268,52247,46825,5262,6,5,21866,21216,600,13,37,"Senate Referee Rejects Key Pieces Of Repeal Bill, Dealing Major Blow To GOP",2017-07-21 18:34:00,"Jonathan Cohn,Laura Bassett,Matt Fuller","Politics","@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_national_beats,health-care-reform,legal-issues,parliamentarian,parliamentarian-of-the-united-states-senate,political-science,senate,type: news,us-government-resources,us-news,us-presidential-elections",347165,301850,347165,478689,42323,217218,1.076,1.137,1.388,1.879,149926,149045,48194,9022,223491,8525,30268,52247,46825,5262,6,5,21866,21216,600,13,37

Clarke, who resigned as sheriff in August, made the threat in a tweet Saturday following stories about the affidavit that was unsealed on Thursday. He also warned libs to bring a hard hat because Im going to smack you around. The affidavit said that last January, Clarke texted his deputies to detain Dan Black after the plane they were on landed in Milwaukee. Black had shaken his head after he recognized Clarke and they had a brief conversation, and Clarke took it as a slight. Just a field interview, no arrest unless he becomes an asshole with your guys, Clarke texted a deputy, according to a screenshot obtained by the FBI.Question for him is why he said anything to me. Why didnt he just keep his mouth shut?  After Black exited the plane he was met by six deputies and two police dogs, questioned, and escorted out of the airport, according to the affidavit. The affidavit was originally filed in March to obtain a search warrant to access Clarkes emails. An investigation of the incident by the Audit Services Division of the Milwaukee County controllers office determined that Clarke had used his official position as sheriff of Milwaukee County in excess of his lawful authority to direct his deputies to stop and question Black without legal justification, the affidavit stated. Still, federal prosecutors informed Clarkes attorney in May that they werent going to pursue charges against him over the incident. On Saturday, Clarke lashed out in several tweets aboutlibs, lib media and fake news following the stories about the affidavit. The tasting blood tweet included a photoshopped image of Trump holding a wrestler labeled CNN who was being kicked in the face by a smiling, photoshopped Clarke. When LYING LIB MEDIA makes up FAKE NEWS to smear me, the ANTIDOTE is go right at them, Clarke tweeted. Punch them in the nose & MAKE THEM TASTE THEIR OWN BLOOD. He later tweeted: Nothing like getting under the skin of lefties like I did today. He warned libs tobring a hard hat, because Im going to smack you around until you crawl back to your moms basement. Clarke posted a note apparently from Twitter saying that it had received complaints about the tasting blood tweet, but that it could not identify any violations of the Twitter rules. Clarke tweeted: Twitter says no violation. Duh. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the note posted by Clarke or whether it was legitimate. One of the Twitter rules is: You may not make specific threats of violence or wish for the serious physical harm, death, or disease of an individual or group of people. Clarke complained in an earlier tweet that the affidavit was old news and that the Justice Department had informed his lawyer thatthere was no evidence of wrongdoing for doing police work. In fact, the letter said that a decision had been made not to criminally prosecute any civil rights offenses against Clarke usingthe only federal statute likely available to us because of concerns that such a case would be difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. The letter warns, however, that the decision could change if additional information came to light. The FBI sought access to Clarkes emails because agents believed he either personally attacked Black in posts on the Milwaukee County Sheriff Facebook page, or encouraged his staff to do so, according to the affidavit. A civil rights lawsuit by Black is still pending against Clarke. Clarke, who spoke at the Republican National Convention in July 2016, infamously encouraged Trump supporters to take up  pitchforks and torches  shortly before the 2016 presidential election because the system was rigged against the GOP nominee. He has also called members of the Black Lives Matter movement creeps. In June he said he turned down a job offer from the Trump administration to be assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. He resigned as sheriff in the wake of concerns about troubling deaths in the county jails his office supervised.",0,56.49,11.1,12.9,715,31,"Trump Booster David Clarke Threatens To Make Media 'Taste Their Own Blood'",2017-12-31 09:28:00,"Mary Papenfuss","Politics","@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_huffpost_now,black-lives-matter,donald-trump,fbi,milwaukee,milwaukee-county-wisconsin,racism,twitter,type: news,us-news",344861,240328,344861,336407,68494,150497,1.045,1.149,1.344,1.6,151753,160830,32278,27638,95872,63164,92186,33581,31440,1335,217,51,16139,15139,98,784,118,"Trump Booster David Clarke Threatens To Make Media 'Taste Their Own Blood'",2017-12-31 09:28:00,"Mary Papenfuss","Politics","@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_huffpost_now,black-lives-matter,donald-trump,fbi,milwaukee,milwaukee-county-wisconsin,racism,twitter,type: news,us-news",344861,240328,344861,336407,68494,150497,1.045,1.149,1.344,1.6,151753,160830,32278,27638,95872,63164,92186,33581,31440,1335,217,51,16139,15139,98,784,118
37,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-no-empathy_us_59e76efce4b0d0e4fe6c8d2d","It was almost too easy to predict what would happen. A president who is infamous for his inability to show empathy tries to convince the media he is the most caring president ever. And it completely backfires. President Donald Trump had been silent for more than a week about the deaths of four U.S. soldiers in Niger, in what was the deadliest combat operation during his time in office. So it wasnt surprising when a reporter questioned him during his Monday press conference about this topic. Why havent we heard anything from you so far about the soldiers that were killed in Niger? And what do you have to say about that? the reporter asked. Trump could have used the moment to talk about the fallen service members. But instead, as he often does, he made it about himself. He tried to brag about how compassionate and considerate he is. Ive written them personal letters.... I will, at some point during the period of time, call the parents and the families <U+2015> because I have done that, traditionally. ... So, the traditional way <U+2015> if you look at President Obama and other presidents, most of them didnt make calls, a lot of them didnt make calls. I like to call when its appropriate, when I think Im able to do it, Trump said. Aides to previous presidents hit back on Trumps claim, noting he is not the first president to call fallen service members families. Trump, feeling defensive, brought up his chief of staff John Kellys son <U+2015> who died serving in Afghanistan <U+2015> to make a political point: He noted that Obama did not call Kelly when his son died in 2010. Its not clear whether Kelly agreed to the politicization of his son. But in the past, he has been reluctant to talk about him and has asked that his death not be brought up . Several Obama advisers were shocked that Trump stooped to that level, and even the White House seemed uneasy with the whole thing; officials would confirm that Kelly never received a call from Obama, but they only agreed to do so anonymously. The day after the press conference, Trump finally called the families of the service members killed in Niger. That move could have put the controversy to rest. But instead, it made Trump look even more insensitive . Trump reportedly told Myeshia Johnson, the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, that her husband  knew what he signed up for . Those comments were relayed by Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.), who is close to the family and was in the car when Trump called Johnson. Trump tweeted Wednesday morning that Wilson was lying and said he had some sort of proof. But later Wednesday,La David Johnsons mother, Cowanda Jones-Johnson, confirmed that the president had shown disrespect to her family . White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders created doubt that any proof of Trumps statement would ever turn up, when she told reporters Wednesday afternoon that there was no recording made of the phone call. Sanders said it was a disgrace for the media to characterize Trumps act of kindness as an act of callousness, and she went after Wilson for speaking out. She refused, however, to say whether Trump had used the words Wilson claimed he said. The presidents call, as accounted by multiple people in the room, believe that the president was completely respectful, very sympathetic, and expressed the condolences of himself and the rest of the country, and thanked the family for their service, commended them for having an American hero in their family, and I dont know how you can take that any other way, she said. A reporter also asked her whether Kelly signed off on Trumps political use of his sons death; Sanders said she was unsure if he did. In a statement Wednesday, Wilson said she stood firmly by her account of Trumps call. This is personal for me, not political, she said. Sgt. Johnson was a member of my community and of the 5000 Role Models of Excellence Project that I founded to help boys of color build successful futures. ... The loved ones Sgt. Johnson leaves behind are my constituents and my job now is to do all that I can to help them heal. Ill save the bully pulpit for the necessary task of uncovering the circumstances surrounding the ambush and working to help ensure that our soldiers have all of the resources and support that they need while putting their lives on the line to keep others safe. Later Wednesday, the news kept getting worse for Trump. Chris Baldridge, the father of Army Cpl. Dillon Baldridge, told The Washington Post that the president called him when he lost his son in June. Trump promised to send him $25,000 and set up an online fundraiser for the family, Baldridge said, but he never followed through. Presidents have traditionally acted as comforters-in-chief, both to the nation and on an individual level. President Ronald Reagan was particularly known for his speeches to a grieving public, and President Barack Obama delivered a moving eulogy in Charleston after a white supremacist killed black churchgoers there. At the personal level, President Abraham Lincoln famously wrote a letter to a widow, Mrs. Bixby, expressing his sympathies: I have been shown in the files of the War Department a statement of the Adjutant General of Massachusetts, that you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle. I feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the Republic they died to save. I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours, to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of Freedom. Trump has not had any such moment. When he traveled to Texas to address the Hurricane Harvey response, he spoke at length about what a great job he and his team were doing. And when he went to Puerto Rico, he told one family of hurricane survivors:  Have a good time . Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

38,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-birth-control_us_59a8adb6e4b0b5e530fd735f","NEW YORK <U+2015> President Donald Trumps administration issued a new rule Friday that allows all employers to opt out of including birth control in their health insurance plans for any moral or religious reason, rolling back the Obama-era requirement that guaranteed contraception coverage at no cost to 62 million women. Requiring insurance plans to cover birth control imposes a substantial burden to the free exercise of religion guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution, and could promote risky sexual behavior among adolescents, the administration told reporters Thursday night. The Affordable Care Act deemed contraception an essential part of womens preventive health care for the first time in history, requiring that it be covered under most insurance plans, along with prenatal care, breast exams and well-woman visits. The birth control mandate compelled for-profit employers to cover the full range of contraceptives, including the pill, the intrauterine device and the Plan B morning-after pill, at no out-of-pocket cost to women, while carving out exemptions for churches and nonprofit religious organizations. The Trump administration, which is stacked with officials who oppose contraception ,will now allow any employer or for-profit company,regardless of whether they are religious, to refuse to include the coverage in their health insurance plans for moral reasons. This could mean that tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of women in the United States will once again have to pay out of pocket for birth control. I think what the Trump administration is trying to do is effectively gut the rule without repealing it, because repealing it would be so unpopular, said Gretchen Borchelt, vice president for reproductive rights and health at the National Womens Law Center. Theyre taking contraception coverage away from women without justification. Womens health groups have argued that the policy, crafted and supported by anti-abortion activists, will have the opposite of its intended effect. Before the law took effect in 2012, one in three women struggled to afford her birth control prescription each month, which can cost up to $50 a pack for the pill and much more for long-acting methods like the IUD. And more than 20 percent of women of childbearing age had to pay for contraception out of pocket. The preventive health benefit saved women $1.4 billion on birth control in the first year it went into effect, which has contributed to an all-time low in unintended pregnancy and the lowest U.S. abortion rate since the procedure became legal in 1973. If you truly want to reduce the need for abortion, Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Dana Singiser told reporters on Thursday, invest in womens health and preventative care. Many religious conservatives who oppose birth control coverage believe some forms of contraception, including the IUD and the morning-after pill, are akin to abortion.According to a report by the left-leaning think tank the Center for American Progress, 45 companies have applied for exemptions to the birth control rule, more than half of which are for-profit companies. Trumps much broader loophole would allow any boss to object to the coverage. The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a legal advocacy group that has fought the contraception mandate in court on behalf of nonprofits, praised Trumps new workaround. We believe that people with sincere religious beliefs should be able to use an exemption, said Lori Windham, an attorney with the group. Its a good way to protect those Americans who want to be able to provide quality health insurance, but cant in good conscience provide contraceptives. Several progressive legal groups, including the National Womens Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union, have indicated that they will challenge the move. The Supreme Court told the Obama administration in April 2016 that it must find a way to accommodate religious employers while also guaranteeing that women continue to receive full and equal contraception coverage,regardless of where they work. Trumps rule does nothing to guarantee women seamless coverage. The groups could also challenge the new regulation on the grounds that it discriminates against women by singling out a womens health benefit. It violates equal protection laws if they are treating women differently, said Borchelt. Were outlining a number of potential legal claims, and we have some really good, strong complaints.",1,46.2,13,15.4,696,28,"Trump Rolls Back Obama's Birth Control Coverage Rule",2017-10-06 11:21:00,"Laura Bassett","Politics","@health_adhd,@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_national_beats,abortion-debate,barack-obama,contraception,donald-trump,legal-issues,obamacare,personal-insurance,prenatal-care,public-health,reproductive-health,type: news,us-government-resources,us-news,womens-sexual-health",339254,288293,339254,279602,41814,169118,1.068,1.189,1.168,1.33,145676,172290,21288,11465,185129,2427,23768,96043,92122,3871,16,7,264071,262871,878,174,148,"Trump Rolls Back Obama's Birth Control Coverage Rule",2017-10-06 11:21:00,"Laura Bassett","Politics","@health_adhd,@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_national_beats,abortion-debate,barack-obama,contraception,donald-trump,legal-issues,obamacare,personal-insurance,prenatal-care,public-health,reproductive-health,type: news,us-government-resources,us-news,womens-sexual-health",339254,288293,339254,279602,41814,169118,1.068,1.189,1.168,1.33,145676,172290,21288,11465,185129,2427,23768,96043,92122,3871,16,7,264071,262871,878,174,148

If Jeff Sessions didnt recuse himself, we wouldnt even be talking about this subject, Trump told The Wall Street Journal. That, said the former top ethics lawyer in President George W. Bushs White House, speaks volumes, particularly in light of Trumps firing of FBI Director James Comey in May. Its not about Comey. Its not about Mueller. Its about the Russia probe, said Richard Painter, now a law professor at the University of Minnesota. Trumps White House did not respond to queries on the matter, and Sessions  the first sitting senator to endorse Trumps campaign last year  has given no indication he intends to leave his job on his own. Painter said that shows good judgment on Sessions part, as does his refusal to fire Mueller. I dont think Sessions is going to do it because I dont think he wants to be charged with obstruction of justice, Painter said. There is no reason to fire Mueller other than to stop the Russia investigation. Randy Evans, a Republican National Committee member from Georgia, defended Trump, saying his criticisms of Sessions do not constitute obstruction of justice  just a president who would have preferred an attorney general who could have kept a distraction under control. He is a very hands-on leader, Evans said, adding that Trump is a president who thinks out loud and is more interested in results than methods. Trump is clearly upset with Sessions, but his public attacks are more akin to a college football coach trying to get better performance from a quarterback than trying to get someone to quit, Evans said. When theres a lack of winning, hes not going to be shy in letting you know about it. Other Republicans said Trumps actions are indefensible, and show how his aberrant behavior has normalized what previously had been unimaginable. Florida GOP consultant Rick Wilson, who worked in the George H.W. Bush White House, said a staffer who recommended firing the attorney general to block an investigation into that president would have been out of a job. That person would have been fired. They would have been shown the door instantaneously. They would have been out in a hot minute, Wilson said. Now, its so much the new normal that everyone just shrugs, and says, Sure. Of course hes trying to obstruct justice. Rick Tyler, a Republican strategist who worked for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the GOP presidential primaries, said that if Trump is unhappy with Sessions, he should tell him so privately, not in media interviews and on Twitter. That should all be internal. It should not be external, Tyler said. Trumps outbursts are causing harm to himself  Comeys firing, for example, led to the appointment of Mueller, Tyler noted. We have Mueller because of Trump, and for no other reason, Tyler said. Hes his own worst enemy. Sessions recused himself from the ongoing investigation into Russian interference after his own undisclosed meetings with Russian officials came to light. That left the probe under the charge of Sessions deputy, Rod Rosenstein. Two months later, Trump fired Comey after the FBI director refused to drop a related investigation into Trumps first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, for his undisclosed Russia contacts. The very next day, Trump told the Russian foreign minister and ambassador during an Oval Office visit that he had fired Comey to relieve the pressure from the FBIs Russia probe. That firing led to the appointment of Mueller as special counsel by Rosenstein  which has become a focus of Trumps anger ever since. That rage appeared to boil over after recent reports that Mueller may be seeking Trumps tax returns in connection with the investigation. Trump refused to release his returns during the campaign, a break from decades of protocol for presidential candidates. Painter, the ethics adviser to George W. Bush, said Trump can, if he chooses, pardon his son Donald Trump Jr. , and son-in-law Jared Kushner to protect them from the probe  and face the political consequences. But ending Muellers investigation, Painter said, requires an attorney general ready to go to jail for Trump. He needs to find someone who will be willing to engage in obstruction of justice, Painter said. Criminal obstruction of justice. Listen to S.V.

41,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anthony-scaramucci-deidre-ball-divorce_us_597bb23fe4b0da64e879438c","The wife of newly named White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci reportedly wants a divorce, just days after giving birth to the couples son. The Page Six gossip column of The New York Post on Friday reported that Deidre Ball, 38, had filed for divorce from Scaramucci. Ball began dating the 53-year-old Scaramucci in 2011 and they are believed to have gotten married in 2014, according to the Post. They have two children together , one of whom was born prematurely this past Monday. Balls lawyer, Jill Stone, on Saturday confirmed the divorce story to The New York Daily News, but shot down rumors that Scaramuccis naked ambition and desire to be a fixture in President Donald Trumps administration drove a wedge between the couple. Whoever decided to state that that was the cause, that has nothing to do with her filing for divorce, Stone told the paper, declining to get into specifics. Its a private matter, Stone said. Shes focusing on the children. She really doesnt have a comment at this time.Shes not going to turn this into a circus. Ball filed for divorce on July 6 in New Yorks Nassau County Supreme Court, according to a Post Page Six story on Saturday. On Monday, Ball gave birth to James Scaramucci two weeks before the childs due date. Weighing 5 pounds, 13 ounces at birth, the boy is currently in a neonatal intensive unit, according to the paper. HuffPost reached out for comment to Ball via Facebook, to Scaramucci via Twitter and to White House press office via email. No responses have yet been received. Scaramucci, who had a previous marriage end in divorce, posted two recent tweets that seemed to refer to the reports of domestic discord with Ball.The first came a short time after the Posts story. The second came Saturday morning. The Post said that Scaramucci had shed his wedding ring recently or was wearing it on his right hand. Deidre is not a fan of Trump, and she hasnt exactly been on board and supportive of Anthony and his push to get a White House job, a n anonymous source reported as close to Scaramucci told the paper. Leonard Sperber, the lawyer hired for Scaramuccis first divorce, told the Daily News he had no authority to comment on anything, including whether or not he had been retained a second time. Balls LinkedIn profile lists her as vice president of investor relations for SkyBridge Capital, an asset management business formerly run by her husband. He sold his interest in the business this year in preparation for a job in the Trump White House. After initially serving in a post at the Export-Import Bank, he was appointed to his communications job on July 21, sparking the resignation of press secretary Sean Spicer. On Thursday, the New Yorker magazine published a profanity-laced interview with Scaramucci in which he attacked in vulgar terms then-White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon, Trumps chief strategist. Priebus resigned from his job Thursday night and on Friday Trump named as his replacement John Kelly, who had been secretary of the Homeland Security Department.",0,59.53,9.9,12.1,522,26,"Anthony Scaramucci's Wife Filed For Divorce While Pregnant, Reports Say",2017-07-30 13:08:00,"David Moye","Politics","@ads_sexy,@health_adhd,@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_trends,anthony-scaramucci,divorce,type: news,us-news",338268,314002,338268,301427,51312,145724,1.045,1.079,1.493,1.545,91387,211093,35788,45808,131286,16444,15846,111419,105349,5923,133,1,11282,11058,50,172,2,"Anthony Scaramucci's Wife Filed For Divorce While Pregnant, Reports Say",2017-07-30 13:08:00,"David Moye","Politics","@ads_sexy,@health_adhd,@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_trends,anthony-scaramucci,divorce,type: news,us-news",338268,314002,338268,301427,51312,145724,1.045,1.079,1.493,1.545,91387,211093,35788,45808,131286,16444,15846,111419,105349,5923,133,1,11282,11058,50,172,2
42,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reince-priebus-out-john-kelly_us_5979fc40e4b02a4ebb739010","WASHINGTON <U+2015> Reince Priebus is out as White House chief of staff after a tumultuous week of clashes within the administration, a departure that adds to the rising upheaval in President Donald Trump s already-fraught inner circle. Trump announced Friday that he had named John Kelly, the secretary of homeland security, as his new chief of staff. Priebus said he submitted his resignation privately on Thursday. It has been one of the greatest honors of my life to serve this president and our country. I want to thank the president for giving me this very special opportunity. I will continue to serve as a strong supporter of the presidents agenda and policies. I cant think of a better person than General John Kelly to succeed me and I wish him Gods blessings and great success, Priebus said in a statement on Friday. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said Trump and Priebus had been discussing his role for weeks. She added that Kelly and Trump had also been discussing the job. In an interview with CNNs Wolf Blitzer, Priebus declined to provide details on why he decided to quit, but said the president thought it was time for a change. He denied that Trump asked for his resignation. The president has a right to change direction. The president has a right to hit the reset button, Priebus said. I think its healthy. Priebus said he would be working with Kelly for a couple of weeks to help with the transition. He declined to discuss newly appointed White House communications director Anthony Scaramuccis incendiary leak accusation. Im not going to respond to it, Priebus said. Im not going to get into the mud on those kind of things. Priebus flew on Air Force One with Trump on Friday, according to a pool report.Trump waited on board the plane when it returned to Andrews Air Force base, and Priebus initially got into a car with White House aides Stephen Miller and Dan Scavino. They then left his car and got in another one. Some reporters approached Priebus car as they learned of his dismissal, and the vehicle left Trumps motorcade before the president departed. Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) said Priebus didnt show any signs over being out of a job while riding Air Force One on Friday. We didnt even know it. We were sitting right across from him and he kept a poker face, he told reporters. Good poker face, showed nothing. Trump also spoke to reporters on Air Force One. Reince is a good man, he said. John Kelly will do a fantastic job. Gen.Kelly has been a star, done an incredible job thus far, respected by everybody. Hes a great great American. Reince is a good man. Sanders released a statement Friday, saying the entire Administration loves [Kelly]and no one is comparable.House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) also weighed in on Priebus exit, praising the Wisconsin native. Reince Priebus has left it all out on the field, for our party and our country. Here is a guy from Kenosha, Wisconsin who revitalized the Republican National Committee and became White House chief of staff, Ryan said in a statement. He has served the president and the American people capably and passionately. He has achieved so much, and he has done it all with class. I could not be more proud to call Reince a dear friend. The shake-up comes after Scaramucci accused Priebus of leaking his personal financial information. Scaramucci tweeted about the disclosure Wednesday night, and hinted at Priebus potential involvement by tagging him in the post. Hours later, in a subsequent tweet, Scaramucci denied that he had meant to vilify Priebus. But in a CNN interview Thursday morning , he seemed to place the onus on Priebus to clear his name. If Reince wants to explain that hes not a leaker, let him do that, Scaramucci said. The publication of Scaramuccis financial information, it has since become clear, was not a leak at all. The Politico reporter who first published it said the data she used was publicly available . And in a New Yorker interview published Thursday, Scaramucci publicly and vulgarly attacked Priebus , calling him a paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac. On Sunday, shortly after he began occupying the communications director post, Scaramucci promised to  fire everybody if leaks did not end. The threat <U+2015> and a subsequent warning about who was in Scaramuccis crosshairs <U+2015> has already prompted a high-profile resignation . White House press aide Michael Short, apparently viewed as a Priebus ally , departed on Tuesday after Scaramucci indicated Short would be his first target when he began to force people out. Priebus exit also comes after the sudden resignation of White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who served as the Republican National Committees communications director when Priebus was its chairman. Spicer left in protest over the news that Trump had appointed Scaramucci as communications director, effectively superseding Spicer with a hedge fund manager with no previous political experience. There have been signs of Priebus waning influence and beleaguered job status for months. After the first version of the Obamacare repeal bill collapsed in the House of Representatives in March, the White House sacked Priebus deputy chief of staff, Katie Walsh , and sent her to Trumps outside political group. Rather than speak to Priebus own foibles, however, his departure attests to Trumps willingness to pit even his most loyal aides against each another. As chairman of the RNC, Priebus relative neutrality in the 2016 Republican presidential primary and staunch support for Trump in the general election proved crucial. Early on in the presidential campaign, when Trump was drawing scorn and mockery for his xenophobic rhetoric, Priebus was careful, reportedly imploring Trump in July 2015 to  tone it down . Later, when top Republican officials like former presidential nominee Mitt Romney were publicly lambasting Trump, Priebus refused to join them. He also stood by Trump once he became the Republican nominee, relentlessly defending him in the media. When The New York Times published a May 2016 bombshell report about Trumps history of mistreating women, Priebus dismissed the revelations . All these stories that come out  and they come out every couple weeks  people just dont care, he said. The following month, Priebus helped kill a last-minute bid by so-called never Trump Republicans to run National Review writer David French as an independent conservative, dubbing it a  suicide mission . French cited the remarks as a major contributing factor in his decision to withdraw. Trump rewarded Priebus for his loyalty with the top White House post, enabling Trump to claim a much-needed modicum of respectability with GOP insiders. But from the outset, the Wisconsin attorney and former RNC chairman was undermined by a team of warring White House factions and outsize personalities. Priebus was the highest-ranking White House representative who came from the Republican Party establishment that newcomers like chief strategist Steve Bannon loathed. Bannon, a self-described economic nationalist with a history of racially insensitive comments, has long been suspicious of pro-business Republicans support for open trade and immigration policies. From the start, Trump put Priebus and Bannon on a collision course with the creation of a chief strategist position that appeared to undercut the normally unquestioned authority of the presidents chief of staff. Trumps unconventional decision to name son-in-law Jared Kushner as a senior adviser also created a power center outside Priebus control. But if Priebus was frustrated with the treatment he endured, he refused to publicly show it. When Trump infamously convened his top advisers and Cabinet officials in June to praise his performance before the news media, Priebus comments stood out for their effusiveness. On behalf of the entire senior staff around you, Mr. President, we thank you for the opportunity and the blessing that youve given us to serve your agenda and the American people, Priebus said. And were continuing to work very hard every day to accomplish those goals.",1,62.27,8.9,12.2,1321,76,"Reince Priebus Out As Chief Of Staff After Chaotic Week At White House",2017-07-28 17:00:00,"Daniel Marans,Sam Levine","Politics","@developing,@genassign,@health_adhd,@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@health_pain,@team_us_news_ga,donald-trump,house-of-representatives,political-science,reince-priebus,republican-politics,type: news,us-news,us-presidential-elections,white-house,white-house-chief-of-staff",337848,272844,337848,483809,38039,216275,1.114,1.225,1.751,1.926,138788,164904,34156,4407,247419,13078,25870,26202,24028,2124,NA,1,9249,9081,110,17,41,"Reince Priebus Out As Chief Of Staff After Chaotic Week At White House",2017-07-28 17:00:00,"Daniel Marans,Sam Levine","Politics","@developing,@genassign,@health_adhd,@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@health_pain,@team_us_news_ga,donald-trump,house-of-representatives,political-science,reince-priebus,republican-politics,type: news,us-news,us-presidential-elections,white-house,white-house-chief-of-staff",337848,272844,337848,483809,38039,216275,1.114,1.225,1.751,1.926,138788,164904,34156,4407,247419,13078,25870,26202,24028,2124,NA,1,9249,9081,110,17,41
43,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-shooter-conspiracy-theories_us_5a01ed2be4b092053058499e","WASHINGTON <U+2015> Authorities are still trying to figure out why a man shot at least 26 people to death in a Texas church on Sunday. But the lack of a specific motive has not stopped right-wing conspiracy theorists from blaming their opponents  including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), atheists, social justice warriors, communists, the Islamic State, liberals and anti-fascist protesters  for the slaughter. The speed at which these theories spread shows how propagandists take advantage of the information vacuum after a shooting to serve their own ends. The shooting was not racially motivated or caused by religious beliefs, authorities said Monday , though they noted there was a domestic situation. (The suspect, Devin Patrick Kelley, was previously convicted for domestic assault.) But in the hours after the shooting, the public didnt know that. Instead, conspiracy theorists took what shreds of information were available to peddle plausible-sounding theories  or simply make up lies. Heres how it unfolded: Sunday, 12:30 p.m. ET Around this time, the shooting took place . 1:24 p.m. ET A reporter for KSAT-TV in San Antonio, Texas, tweeted : #BREAKING confirmed shooting at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, police say multiple victims. As news continued to break, most reporters were careful not to draw attention to unverified information. 1:58 p.m. ET Mike Cernovich, a right-wing media personality, had been retweeting some of the few details provided by reporters at outlets like KSAT. But at this time, Cernovich <U+2015> who portrays himself as a legitimate journalist <U+2015> sent his own tweet , where he noted that the church had a largely white denomination and speculated, without presenting evidence, Antifa terrorist attack? Antifa is shorthand for anti-fascist and refers to a loose network of activists, some of whom aim to physically confront white supremacists. The group has served as a convenient boogeyman for conservatives, including President Donald Trump. The day before the shooting, far-right media had warned of an antifa apocalypse, with activists waging violent civil war . In reality, an anti-Trump group, Refuse Fascism, had called for peaceful political protests around the country, and a few occurred, without incident . The threatened antifa uprising had failed to materialize . At this point, there were still no publicly confirmed details about the shooter. 3 p.m. ET A screenshot of an alleged message by a guy named Dave Pollack was making the Twitter rounds. Go after the heart of the far-right: conservative churches, he allegedly wrote. This screenshot had previously been shared by Jack Posobiec, a pro-Trump figure, prior to the shooting, on Nov. 3 , according to the Twitter time stamp. Dave will become important. 3:41 p.m. ET A Twitter user named Mustachio shared what he claimed was a video manifesto of the shooter <U+2015> whom he called a Muslim convert, Samir al-Hajeed <U+2015> along with fake photos. He was trolling. (Spreading the name Samir al-Hajeed after a shooting is a long-standing hoax .) As Snopes reported , Mustachio was cited by a couple of websites, including right-wing site Freedom Daily , which did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment. 5:37 p.m. ET Around this time, the suspect was publicly identified as Devin Patrick Kelley, and a Daily Beast editor tweeted a story that included pictures from a Facebook page allegedly belonging to the shooter. (HuffPost was not able to independently corroborate this page belonged to Kelley.) People immediately delved into the shooters Facebook likes, which are, in general, a crappy journalistic tool. The suspect allegedly liked atheist pages , CNN and something called Together We Rise, according to Heavy. Conspiracy theorists pointed to the latter as evidence that the shooter supported Bernie Sanders. Some liberal groups with names similar to Together We Rise exist on Facebook, but the only Together We Rise page we could find that users can like on Facebook is a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of foster youth. The shooter also allegedly had a LinkedIn account where he listed causes he supported, including Animal Welfare, Children, Civil Rights and Social Action, Environment and Human Rights. To propagandists, this seemed to prove the shooter was some kind of liberal social justice warrior. In response to a question about whether LinkedIn users simply choose pre-selected causes from a drop-down menu, LinkedIn spokesperson Tatiana De Almeida said, That is correct <U+2015> there is a dropdown menu of options such as Economic Empowerment, Education and more that the member can select from. People used this information as proof of a motive, anyway. 6 p.m. ET The website YourNewsWire tweeted out an article making wild claims about the shooters connections to antifa. The story cobbled together photos from the Facebook page allegedly belonging to the shooter with a photograph of a different person holding an anti-fascist flag. The article claimed that the shooter vowed to start a civil war by targeting white conservative churches and causing anarchy in the United States. The story also included screenshots from a new guy: Brian (cousin). This person, Brian, supposedly talked to some people who were inside. Thats how Brian learned that two shooters entered the church, threw an antifa flag over the pulpit and then killed people who failed to properly recite verses from Karl Marxs three-volume foundational critique of capitalism, Das Kapital. There is zero evidence any of this happened. The byline on the story was Baxter Dmitry. No one in U.S. public records has that name. The story appeared to be shared more than 264,000 times on Facebook, making it a blockbuster. Dmitry and YourNewsWire did not respond to a request for comment about Brian. 6:14 p.m. ET Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones joined the fray. Jones a prominent promoter of the false theory that antifa was going to violently overthrow the Trump administration on Nov. 4  wondered whether the shooter was part of the Antifa revolution against Christians and conservatives or a Isis op? Authorities have provided no evidence the shooting was connected to the Islamic State militant group also known as ISIS, and again, said it was not religiously or politically motivated. 6:42 p.m. ET Cernovich doubled down. He tweeted that Photos of Texas shooter is consistent with profile of Antifa member. This is looking more and more like Antifa terror. (Authorities have provided no evidence to date of the shooter being tied to antifa.) In response to questions from HuffPost about the legitimacy of his reporting and how he can identify antifa members based on photographs, he asked: Do you disavow this HuffPo column claiming a violent response to Trump is as logical as any? Do you disavow this HuffPo column calling for a white wounding? Do you disavow poltical [sic] violence by antifa? Or do you see yourself as a PR agent for antifa? (The referenced columns appeared on HuffPosts contributor platform and were written by a person who is not a HuffPost employee.) Sunday Afternoon: Remember Dave? Sometime on Sunday, a YouTube user published a video linking the shooter to antifa. It claimed to show the same screenshots of the alleged message posted by Dave Pollack revealing secret antifa plans: Go after the heart of the far-right: conservative churches. Daves message was allegedly made on a Facebook page for Its Going Down, a digital community center for anarchists and other activists. Conspiracy theorists pointed to this message, without evidence, as proof that Dave inspired the shooter. We did not have enough information to find Dave. A spokesperson for Its Going Down told HuffPost in an email that they couldnt find Dave, either. If the screenshots are not fake, we would highly suspect they were posted there by online trolls in the lead up to November 4th, to be used by conspiracy theorists to claim that antifascists wanted to engage in violence against everyday Americans. The group also denied that the shooter is involved with anti-fascist organizing. As the far-Right did after the Las Vegas shooting, they have tried to draw a connection between the two as a means of influencing public debate and also keeping their own conspiracy theory based internet companies and careers afloat, the spokesperson said. That same YouTube video claimed the shooters most recent voter registration showed he listed his political party affiliation as UAF, which the presenter claimed stands for United Against Fascism Party, a British anti-fascist group. The alleged voter registration showed Kelley registered at a former address in Colorado. The United Against Fascism Party is not an active political party in Colorado or Texas. The shooters actual Colorado voter registration states that his party affiliation is UAF. In Colorado, as in many other states, UAF stands for unaffiliated. Kelleys Texas voter registration states that he did not register with a political party. The shooter was not registered with any political party, according to public records. Monday Evening By late Monday night, hundreds of thousands of users across multiple platforms had shared fake news about the shooter. As these theories swirled around the internet, Google was criticized for helping spread their rise. Justin Hendrix, executive director of the NYC Media Lab , tweeted screenshots showing that the search engine was listing conspiratorial tweets about the shooter as Popular on Twitter. (HuffPost did not independently verify Hendrixs screenshots.) On Monday, the search engine also auto-completed the shooters name, Devin Patrick Kelley, with antifa, according to The Daily Beast. The search results appearing from Twitter, which surfaced based on our ranking algorithms, are changing second by second, a Google spokesperson told HuffPost in an email. For the queries in question, they are not the first results we show on the page. Instead, they appear after news sources, including our Top Stories carousel which we have been constantly updating.  Autocomplete predictions are algorithmically generated, a Google spokesperson also noted. Because of this, terms that appear in Autocomplete may be unexpected or unpleasant, the spokesperson added.

On Thursday, the conservative radio host announced on his show that hed be evacuating South Florida, where he lives, and would be off the air for the next couple of days. This comes mere days after he lambasted media stations for their coverage and storm preparers for battening down their hatches. May as well announce this: Im not going to get into details because of the security nature of things, but it turns out that we will not be able to do the program here tomorrow, Limbaugh said on his Thursday broadcast. Well be on the air next week, folks, from parts unknown... Tomorrow will be problematic. Legally impossible for us to originate the program out of here. Limbaugh has long been hell-bent on saying hurricanes and storms like it are part of a liberal conspiracy solely aimed at furthering the discussion on climate change , but his claims about Irma in his Tuesday broadcast sent many over the edge. Limbaugh ranted on air, Here comes a hurricane, local media goes on the air, Big hurricane coming, oh, my God! Make sure you got batteries. Make sure you got water. It could be the worst ever. Have you seen the size of this baby? Its already a Cat 5. Oh, my God, oh, my God, its bigger than the island of Haiti. Oh, my God. People run to the stores, they stock up everything , and they hoard. And they end up with vacant stores, nothing there. And its a big success. TV stations got eyeballs, the advertising businesses have sold out of business, gotta restock and the cycle repeats. He also said that all you need is to create the fear and panic accompanied by talk that climate change is causing hurricanes to become more frequent and bigger and more dangerous, and you create the panic, and its mission accomplished, agenda advanced. In addition to announcing his relocating to parts unknown, Limbaugh still doubled down on his statements from earlier in the week. The views expressed by the host of this program documented to be almost always right 99.8 percent of the time, he said. There is a reason for that because we engage in a relentless and unstoppable pursuit of the truth and we find and proclaim it and that happens to drive people crazy. The devastation of Hurricane Irma is expected to be even more catastrophic than that of 1992's monster storm Hurricane Andrew.",0,71.75,7.3,10.3,427,26,"Rush Limbaugh Says Hurricane Irma Is Conspiracy, Evacuates Anyway",2017-09-08 10:16:00,"Jenna Amatulli","Politics","@bustournewsletter,@health_adhd,@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_trends,hurricane-andrew,hurricane-irma,natural-disasters,rush-limbaugh,type: news,us-news",336050,303822,336050,258767,42531,146796,1.061,1.126,1.234,1.417,101070,205728,29252,93479,151495,4462,15423,56548,50207,6191,29,10,49214,48822,279,80,33,"Rush Limbaugh Says Hurricane Irma Is Conspiracy, Evacuates Anyway",2017-09-08 10:16:00,"Jenna Amatulli","Politics","@bustournewsletter,@health_adhd,@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_trends,hurricane-andrew,hurricane-irma,natural-disasters,rush-limbaugh,type: news,us-news",336050,303822,336050,258767,42531,146796,1.061,1.126,1.234,1.417,101070,205728,29252,93479,151495,4462,15423,56548,50207,6191,29,10,49214,48822,279,80,33
45,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-business-council-charlottesville_us_59947976e4b0acc593e4757f","The White Houses two advisory councils of top business executives disbanded on Wednesday amid intense public blowback against President Donald Trumps response to the deadly attack by an accused white supremacist in Charlottesville, Virginia. The move came two days after executives began resigning from the dwindling American Manufacturing Council and hours after the billionaire financier who headed the separate Strategic and Policy Forum hosted a call with other members of that panel. Trump took credit on Twitter for dissolving the advisory panels in order to alleviate pressure on the executives. He took the cowards way out and disbanded the business council before anyone else bailed out, Jonathan Bernstein, founder of the consultancy Bernstein Crisis Management, said to HuffPost. Rather than face more resignations,he just further proved that he was only interested in people who agreed with him. The tone of Trumps announcement was a sharp departure from his previous, combative statements lashing out at those who had already resigned in protest of his refusal to quickly and pointedly condemn white supremacists. After Merck & Co. CEO Kenneth Frazier, the only African-American on the manufacturing council, stepped down on Monday, Trump lambasted his companys high drug prices. Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich dropped out later Monday evening, just hours after Trump gave a press conference in which he said that racism is evil and called out the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis. On Tuesday, the president disparaged the two businessmen as grandstanders and vowed to replace them. But his criticism did nothing to stem the departures. Exactly 15 minutes after Trump posted his tweet,Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, quit the manufacturing council. Paul tweeted that  Its the right thing for me to do . On Tuesday evening, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka announced his resignation amid mounting pressure from unions in the federation. The retreat continued on Wednesday with Inge Thulin, chief executive of the industrial conglomerate 3M, resigning after  careful consideration .Denise Morrison, chief executive of the Campbell Soup Company, resigned soon after. And within minutes of Trumps tweet announcing the end of both panels, Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky sent out a press release declaring to be unacceptable the presidents statements equating those who are motivated by race-based hate with those who stand up against hatred. In an email to HuffPost, a spokeswoman said Gorsky had resolved to resign from the manufacturing council before the president posted his tweet. She did not respond when asked if the White House had alerted Johnson & Johnson of the disbanding of the councils before making it public. The 16 members of the Strategic and Policy Forum, meanwhile, remained mostly quiet. Steve Schwarzman, chief executive of financial giant BlackStone Group, and Mark Weinberger, chief executive of the professional services firm EY, made statements condemning hatred and bigotry, but told HuffPost on Tuesday that they planned to remain on the panel. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon issued a strong rebuke of Trumps response to the Charlottesville violence in a statement posted on the companys website. But he indicated that he planned to stay on the Strategic and Policy Forum. A spokeswoman for Toby Cosgrove told HuffPost that the chief executive of the nonprofit hospital chain Cleveland Clinic planned to remain on the panel too because it gave him access to the highest level of government to give direct input on healthcare issues. Three executives either declined to comment Tuesday or were away on vacation. The nine other members <U+2015> including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi and General Motors CEO Mary Barra <U+2015> did not respond to HuffPosts request for comment. On Wednesday, protesters descended on BlackStone and JPMorgan headquarters demanding that their chieftains leave the council. Late that morning, Schwarzman <U+2015> a close Trump confidant <U+2015> held a conference call with other members of the Strategic and Policy Forum, according to The New York Times . The executives talked and decided to abandon the group. All those defections are likely to further isolate the White House from the very corporate leaders whom Trump has intensely courted with pledges to lower taxes and eliminate regulations deemed onerous. Even before the violence in Charlottesville and Trumps halfhearted response, people had been leaving the Strategic and Policy Forum. In February, then-Uber CEO Travis Kalanick stepped down in hopes of distancing his ride-hailing service from Trumps executive order barring travelers from several Muslim-majority nations. In May, Tesla and SpaceX chief Elon Musk resigned after Trumps withdrawal from the Paris climate accord left him no choice. Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger also resigned over the presidents decision to pull the U.S. out of the historic climate agreement, which was signed by every country except Syria and Nicaragua. West Wing infighting, repeated policy fumbles and bombastic public statements from the president have dimmed executives hopes that the Trump administration will accomplish its ambitious pro-business agenda. The instability sown by the presidents response to the Charlottesville attack, which left anti-racism protester Heather Heyer dead and nearly two dozen injured, wont help. Hes clueless on what to do, he doesnt want to admit hes clueless on what to do, he brings in advisers, and when they dont agree, he fires, criticizes or both, Bernstein said. That is making the entire business world nervous, even though, at first glance, the Trump administration would seem to be business friendly.",0,48.23,12.2,13.6,893,39,"Trump's Two Big Business Councils Disband Amid Uproar Over Charlottesville",2017-08-16 13:10:00,"Alexander C.

Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) was still scrambling to do damage control Monday after it was revealed that he switched his vote on the GOP tax bill to yes soon after a tax deduction was added that could benefit his real estate investments. Asked on ABCs This Week on Sunday about the late addition to the tax bill, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said it was meant to cobble together votes to pass the Republican measure . Corker was the only GOP senator remaining Friday who had declared his opposition to the bill. But by the end of the day, after the new deduction became part of the final bill, he issued a surprise statement announcing that he was backing the tax bill because it was an opportunity for business . Voting on the bill is expected to begin Tuesday. Corker had long been opposed to the tax bill because of projections it would add an estimated $1 trillion to the federal budget deficits over 10 years. Its possible that the latest version of the bill (with the government getting even less money with the new deduction) could mean even worse news for the nations debt.Corkers switch was so troubling because nothing about his concerns about the deficit were addressed, tweeted Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.). Corker is now being lambasted with the trending hashtag #CorkerKickback . The International Business Times has reported that Corker, other GOP leaders and Donald Trump and his family stand to pocket millions of dollars in reduced taxes under the new provision. Corker has denied that his change of heart was related to the new perk and said that he had nothing to do with drafting the provision nor did he know it was in the latest version of the tax bill.Then why did he switch his support if he didnt know what was in the new version of the bill? Corker admitted to the IBT: I had like a two-page summary I went through with leadership. I never saw the actual text . Corker wrote Sunday to Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Finance Committee, asking that he clarify how the new deduction came to be in the bill . Hatchs letter backed Corker,saying that the Tennesseean had nothing to do with the provision and that he was disgusted by any implication that Corker switched to supporting the bill in exchange for the real estate perk. The new provision tacked on Friday offers a 20 percent deduction on real estate and other income earned through pass-through entities, such as limited liability companies and partnerships.Such companies dont pay corporate tax but pass through the income to owners who then pay through their individual tax returns. Under the new bill, Corker could save as much as $1 million in taxes on income from several real estate partnerships, IBT determined. Corkers press spokesman did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment. But in an interview with The New York Times, Corker called the accusations against him  disheartening .

George Papadopoulos, 30,pleaded guilty on Oct. 5, but the case wasnt unsealed until Monday, when two other Trump associates were indicted by a federal grand jury. Papadopoulos reached a plea deal with prosecutors, and has since been cooperating with special counsel Robert Muellers probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Prosecutors statement of the offense alleges Papadopoulos was offered thousands of emails containing dirt on Clinton in April 2016 <U+2015> months before the Russian hack of the Democratic National Committee was known. Papadopoulosmade material false statements and material omissions during a Jan. 27 interview with the FBI, according to the statement. He was arrested July 27.Prosecutors agreed to recommend between no prison time to six months under the plea agreement. Papadopoulos told the FBI an overseas professor had told him about the Russians possessing dirt on then-candidate Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails, but stated multiple times that he learned that information prior to joining the campaign, according to court documents. In fact, Papadopoulos was contacted after he learned hed be joining the campaign, and the professor only mentioned the thousands of emails after hed been on the Trump campaign for more than a month. The professor, the statement indicates, had substantial connections to Russian government officials even though Papadopoulos claimed the professor was a nothing. Papadopoulos sent a High-Ranking Campaign Official an email titled New message from Russia back in June 2016, in which he said the Russian ministry of foreign affairs wanted to meet with either Trump or a campaign official in an off-the-record capacity, according to the prosecutors statement.

In a tweet, Spicer said he would continue to serve through August, noting its been an honor & a privilege to work under President Donald Trump . Glenn Thrush of The New York Times reported Spicer resigned after Anthony Scaramucci was named White House communications director on Friday. Spicer reportedly expressed his objection to the appointment of Scaramucci to Trump before announcing his intention to leave his role. CNN reported Spicer said he wanted to give the president and the new team a clean slate . ABC and the Times said Trump did not ask for Spicers resignation . Scaramucci announced during Friday afternoons press briefing that deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders will take over Spicers role. Spicers messaging frequently clashed with that of President Donald Trump . Trump most recently contradicted Spicers Jan. 31 explanation that the presidents controversial executive order on immigration was not a ban. I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN! Trump tweeted on June 5, days after a major attack in London prompted him to renew his call for the Supreme Court to reinstate the order to bar citizens of six majority-Muslim countries from traveling to the U.S. Spicers tenure was marred with questionable moments, including a struggle with White House messaging on the firing of FBI Director James Comey on May 9.At one point, Spicer hid among some bushes to avoid answering journalists questions about Comeys firing. CNN reported the next day that Trump and his team had monitored Sanders performance at the White House daily press briefing, where she filled in while Spicer fulfilled his U.S. Navy Reserve duty. Spicer was tapped to be Trumps press secretary in December 2016. Before that , he worked as chief strategist and communications director for the Republican National Committee. He had a rocky start to his run as press secretary when on Jan. 21, one day after Trumps inauguration, he held a last-minute press briefing in which he ripped the media for accurately reporting that Trump had fewer people attend his swearing-in than former President Barack Obama did in 2009. He accused members of the media of engaging in deliberately false reporting and refused to take questions. Spicers war with the media continued throughout his time in the White House press office. In February, he blocked several news outlets , including CNN and The New York Times, from attending an off-camera press briefing. In March, he was criticized for telling senior journalist April Ryan to stop shaking her head . In April, Spicer claimed Nazi leader Adolf Hitler never used chemical weapons . Spicer went on to refer to the gas chambers used to kill millions of Jews as Holocaust centers. He later sent a clarification on his remarks that he revised three separate times . Spicer used his position to spread falsehoods and repeat unverified claims made by Trump, including accusations of widespread voter fraud and claims that Obama had ordered wiretapping of Trumps team during the 2016 presidential election. Spicer was famously portrayed by actress Melissa McCarthy on NBCs Saturday Night Live. This bothered Trump, who didnt like that a male member of his staff was being portrayed by a woman, according to Politico .",0,61.56,9.2,12.4,542,30,"Sean Spicer Resigns As White House Press Secretary",2017-07-21 12:02:00,"Paige Lavender","Politics","@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_ga,donald-trump,international-news,republican-politics,sean-spicer,type: news,us-news,white-house,white-house-press-secretary",331562,298098,331562,373020,38322,170314,1.058,1.124,2.152,1.706,133895,176346,21321,7847,160216,2638,30307,114509,111221,3033,56,2,102245,101920,203,85,37,"Sean Spicer Resigns As White House Press Secretary",2017-07-21 12:02:00,"Paige Lavender","Politics","@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_ga,donald-trump,international-news,republican-politics,sean-spicer,type: news,us-news,white-house,white-house-press-secretary",331562,298098,331562,373020,38322,170314,1.058,1.124,2.152,1.706,133895,176346,21321,7847,160216,2638,30307,114509,111221,3033,56,2,102245,101920,203,85,37

Stone exploded shortly after the network was the first to report Friday night that a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., had filed initial charges in the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. No details were available about the sealed indictments, but an arrest could be made as early as Monday, CNN reported. Stone attacked several CNN anchors and contributors by name, including Jake Tapper, Bill Kristol, Carl Bernstein, Don Lemon and Ana Navarro, as well as New York Times columnist Charles Blow. He called Lemon an ignorant lying covksucker (sic), and adull witted arrogant partyboi, adding: You fake news you dumb piece of shit.He said Lemon should be humiliated, mocked and punished. Stone also said that Tapper should be severely punished. He called Navarro a dumbfuck, and attacked Kristol for his appearance, saying he was packing on the pounds. Twitter has not commented publicly about Stones account, which was suspended Saturday. By any measure, though, several of Stones tweets violated Twitters standards of conduct , which bar hateful conduct, harassment and messages that promote violence. BuzzFeed, citing unnamed sources, reported that Stones suspension is permanent . The Hollywood Reporter , citing a source with direct knowledge of the situation, also reported that Stone is permanently banned. In order to ensure that people feel safe expressing diverse opinions and beliefs, we do not tolerate behavior that crosses the line into abuse, including behavior that harasses, intimidates, or uses fear to silence another users voice,a Twitter spokesperson told the Reporter. Stones account was suspended in March, and again in April after he wrote threatening tweets to a spokeswoman for the progressive media watchdog group Media Matters. Stone has a reputation as a vicious attack dog for Trump, and has been investigated by the FBI for possible links to Russia during the presidential election, The New York Times reported in January. He has admitted that he communicated with Guccifer 2.0, the hacker whom the FBI has linked to Russian interference in the 2016 election. But, Stone insisted, that doesnt mean he colluded with the Kremlin. Stone texted BuzzFeed, saying hed been informed that I have been suspended for 3 hours and 12 minutes.

Robert E. Lee in Emancipation Park Saturday night was littered with evidence of President Donald Trump s cultivation of the far right: protest signs with messages like The Jewish Media Is Going Down, The Goyim Know and We Support President Donald Trump. Only several hours earlier here, white supremacist demonstrators and counter-protesters had engaged in open combat for hours . The sounds of screams had mixed with the sounds of people coughing, their lungs full of mace. Tear gas canisters and rocks and full water bottles and bags of feces flew through the air. Blood stained the sidewalk. A few blocks away at the intersection of Fourth Street and Water Street Saturday night, police collected evidence from where a 20-year-old white supremacist named James Alex Fields Jr. had allegedly plowed his car into marching counter-protesters, sending bodies flying. A 32-year-old paralegal named Heather Heyer was killed and at least 19 others were injured. Police removed metal barricades from the street as a helicopter circled overhead. Nearby bars, usually bustling on a Saturday night, were shuttered and empty. On the sidewalk, a lone Always Anti-Fascist poster  dropped or discarded during the days chaos  stared up from the sidewalk. Meanwhile, at a friends house in the area, 25-year-old Eli Mosley stepped away from a party he and his white supremacist buddies in the alt-right group Identity Evropa were enjoying to talk to HuffPost over the phone. His voice was hoarse. He had spent the day screaming and chanting among thousands of like-minded people carrying Nazi and Confederate flags to protest the potential removal of the giant Lee statue in the park. The Anti-Defamation League said it was the largest gathering of white supremacists in more than a decade. Our people are feeling real good right now, he said. We view this is as a civil rights movement at this point. Were advocating for white rights and white people, who will soon be a minority in this country. This day was a milestone pushing us into our next stage. We had a large turnout. Were coming back to Charlottesville, he added defiantly. The clashes like the one in Charlottesville are largely a phenomenon of the Trump era. Over the past year, HuffPost has followed the white nationalists in their escalating war with their extremist opposite, from Berkeley to Portland to New Orleans to Gettysburg . In May, again in Charlottesville , white nationalists marched with torches and chanted Nazi slogans. Over the course of these battles, each side has grown angrier, and more heavily armed. Eli Mosley is typical of the alt-right movement <U+2015> the latest incarnation of organized racism in America <U+2015> which has grown exponentially larger since Donald Trump announced his run for the White House. Hes young and media-savvy and knew how to bring thousands of white supremacists together for Saturdays Unite The Right rally. Years ago people like Mosley saw themselves as a fringe group in American politics. Now, under Trump, they feel like their views are gaining momentum, even becoming mainstream, they say. In Trumps statement about Charlottesville Saturday, he refused to specifically condemn the white supremacists who besieged this picturesque college town. We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides <U+2015> on many sides, he told reporters during a late-afternoon news conference in New Jersey. White supremacists were more than pleased with his reaction. Trumps comments were good, read a post on the prominent white nationalist site Daily Stormer as they live-blogged yesterdays events. He refused to answer a question about White Nationalists supporting him, the post continued. No condemnation at all. When asked to condemn, he just walked out of the room. Really, really good. God bless him. With a president of the United States not condemning Nazism, and after over a year of signaling his support for white nationalism, experts are deeply concerned that were in store for political violence even worse than the kind that visited Charlottesville. Thats because an emboldened fringe right, has in turn, emboldened the far left. Professor Brian Levin, head of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, said in an interview with HuffPost by phone that the fatality and injuries Saturday ensure that the much smaller and less coalesced far left, which includes anti-fascist or Antifa protesters, would go looking for revenge. Its a reciprocal dance of extremism, Levin said. Heidi Beirich, head of the Southern Poverty Law Centers Intelligence Project, agreed. When anti-fascists show up to violently fight white supremacists, she said, it only gives oxygen to the white supremacist cause. Were concerned this is going to spill out of Charlottesville into many other places, she added. Something that would go a long way in breaking this vicious cycle, they both agreed, is decisive action from the White House. In a statement Sunday the Anti-Defamation League spelled out what that action could be. The group called on Trump to terminate all staff with any ties to white nationalists, likely referring to prominent White House advisers Steve Bannon, Steven Miller, and Sebastian Gorka, all of whom are linked to racist, fringe figures and groups. This is a moment that demands moral leadership, ADL President Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement. President Trump should acknowledge that this is not a matter of equivalence between two sides with similar gripes. There is no rationalizing white supremacy and no room for this vile bigotry. It is un-American and it needs to be condemned without hesitation. On Sunday morning, Eli Mosley said he was preparing to leave the house where he had partied and slept the night before with his fellow white nationalists. He said he thought Trumps comments were neutral in a way that he liked. He claimed to have lost his job three months ago after being exposed as a white nationalist online. He said hes working full-time now as an alt-right organizer. For this new life, he said he was preparing to drive home to Pennsylvania Sunday so he could pack his things for a move to Virginia. In Virginia, he said, he could more easily organize the next big alt-right rallies in the state capital, Richmond, and of course, in Charlottesville. America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know whats going on.

55,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-repeal-flames-out-senate_us_597a6adbe4b02a4ebb744da0","Seven years of Republican promises to repeal the Affordable Care Act withered away to almost nothing on the Senate floor early Friday morning . The Republican majority in Congress has voted dozens of times since 2011 to repeal all or part of the Affordable Care Act, and a central element of the GOPs pitch to voters during last years election was that giving Donald Trump the keys to the White House and leaving Congress in the Republican Party s hands was all that was needed to bring an end to Obamacare. But when presented with their first genuine opportunity to do so <U+2015> and to have to answer for the consequences <U+2015> enough Republican senators flinched that the effort failed, despite pressure from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and President Trump. Voting to dramatically increase the number of uninsured Americans is easier when you know it cant happen than when you know it will. The final vote for the Health Care Freedom Act , designed to eliminate core components of the Affordable Care Act, went down on a 49-51 vote , with Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, John McCain of Arizona and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joining with all 46 of the chambers Democrats and both of its independents to defeat the measure. Just before the vote, it became apparent that Republicans did not have the support they needed, as McCain came to the floor and told GOP leaders he planned to vote no. Collins and Murkowski had looked apt to vote no all week after opposing the motion to proceed to the initial legislation. For nearly an hour, Republicans <U+2015> including Vice President Mike Pence, who was on-hand to break a tie <U+2015> tried to persuade McCain and Murkowski to no avail. They had made up their minds. McCain, who was diagnosed with brain cancer last week, was only on hand because of a dramatic return Tuesday to open debate on the bill. After voting for the motion to proceed to the bill, McCain delivered an impassioned speech in which he indicated he didnt support the health care plan. But many thought that, with the scaled-down version of the bill up for consideration, McCain would vote to advance the legislation so that the Senate could conference the bill with the House. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) offered some assurances that he would establish a conference committee, but they apparently werent enough for McCain. Or, at least, McCain thought it was time Republicans try a new approach. The entire health care process has been marked by an incredible breach of the normal congressional procedures. Even the vote itself came in the wee hours of the morning Friday , capping off an extraordinarily rushed, chaotic and secretive legislative process. Senators had about three hours to weigh the consequences of legislation McConnell hastily assembled Thursday and made public after 10 p.m. EDT . McConnell pulled the bill and returned it to the Senate calendar, which enables him to bring it back up at a later date if he chooses. Republican congressional leaders have pledged since the Affordable Care Act became law that they would repeal it, and Trump made that a main tenet of his 2016 presidential campaign. In its place, they promised to establish a new and better health care system with lower costs and more choice. As Congress has considered repeal this year, the promise to kill the law has been the primary, if not solitary, rationale for hurrying ahead with legislation that could add millions of people to the ranks of the uninsured and cause turmoil in the health insurance market. In the end, this motivation proved inadequate for three Republican senators. And with that, the Obamacare repeal campaign is as close to dead as it has ever been. The law has now survived the Republican takeover of Congress, President Barack Obama s 2012 reelection campaign, two Supreme Court rulings and Trumps victory last year. The bill that died in the Senate on Friday would not have fully repealed the Affordable Care Act. The Health Care Freedom Act was limited to striking a handful of the laws core elements. The legislation would have eliminated the fines associated with the laws mandate that most Americans obtain health coverage or face tax penalties and canceled enforcement of its requirement that large companies offer health insurance to full-time workers until 2025. Left in place would have been Obamacares health insurance exchanges and subsidies for low- and middle-income families, its provisions guaranteeing coverage to people with pre-existing conditions and a standard set of benefits, its Medicaid expansion, and its myriad rules and regulations on the health insurance industry. The Senate bill wouldnt even have repealed all of the Affordable Care Acts taxes, such as those on wealthy people, but it would have extended a current moratorium on a tax on medical device sales until 2021. The legislation also wouldve halted federal payments to Planned Parenthood for one year. Under this legislation, health insurance premiums would have risen by 20 percent and 16 million fewer people would have health coverage <U+2015> 15 million of them next year alone, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected in a report released Thursday night. In spite of the Senate vote, repeal remains the stated goal of the Republican Party , and polls indicate its core voters still want it. And Trump, whos been clear he would sign any health care bill that could clear Congress, wont like being denied a political win this early in his tumultuous presidency. House Republicans also wont be satisfied. In May, the lower chamber passed its own bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Lawmakers who supported that legislation will be displeased that the Senates failure made their risky vote meaningless. The Houses American Health Care Act would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 23 million , according to the CBO, and disadvantage older, poorer and sicker people in the health insurance market. The legislation passed the House by a narrow margin with some lawmakers voting yes <U+2015> ironically, in hindsight <U+2015> with the expectation that the Senate would come up with a better bill. It did not. As for the Senate, the collapse of repeal on Friday strongly suggests that there isnt a deal that can be made and that Republican senators may be eager to move on to other business. Theoretically, the House bill could serve as a vehicle to revive the repeal effort. But senators immediately rejected it when it passed. And on Tuesday, the Senate failed to achieve a majority on a broadly similar bill, the Better Care Reconciliation Act . That Senate bill wouldve added 22 million people to the ranks of the uninsured, according to the CBO. Moreover, the principal problem confronting congressional Republicans isnt the fine details of the policies contained in the various bills lawmakers have considered this year, nor is it arcane procedural rules that complicated their legislating. At its heart, the dilemma is that the Republican Party does not have, and has never had, a clear vision of what kind of health care system it wants. Republicans have become skilled at pointing out the Affordable Care Acts failings and imperfections <U+2015> the real ones, the exaggerated ones and the fabricated ones. But they have never agreed on how to fix those problems or how to reform the health care system in ways that deliver on their promises of lower costs and more choice.

The percentage of voters identifying as Democratic has remained at 44 percent. The lower numbers could be a cause for alarm for the GOP in midterm elections next year.

57,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-pardon-joe-arpaio_us_599da366e4b0a296083b9758","WASHINGTON <U+2015> President Donald Trump on Friday pardoned a notorious former Arizona sheriff who willfully violated a federal judges order by unlawfully detaining individuals his officers claimed might be in the country illegally. Former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who had previously proclaimed himself Americas toughest sheriff, was convicted of criminal contempt last month for violating a 2011 order that barred Arpaio and his office from detaining individuals solely based on suspicions about their legal status. Arpaio, 85, was scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 5. Throughout his time as Sheriff, Arpaio continued his lifes work of protecting the public from the scourges of crime and illegal immigration, the White House said in a statement late Friday. Sheriff Joe Arpaio is now eighty-five years old, and after more than fifty years of admirable service to our Nation, he is a worthy candidate for a Presidential pardon. Trumps pardon of Arpaio, the first of his presidency, amounts to a tacit endorsement of Arpaios discriminatory tactics and reads as a favor to a political ally. The media-savvy former sheriff, known for parading inmates around in pink underwear,supported the former reality TV stars presidential campaign and spoke at the Republican National Convention last summer. Both men were prominent promoters of the racist conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama wasnt born in the United States. Arpaio, who served as sheriff from 1993 through 2016, had long been accused of discriminatory practices against Latinos. A 2011 report by the U.S. Department of Justices Civil Rights Division concluded there was reasonable cause to believe that Arpaio and his office engaged in a pattern or practice of unlawful policing and racial profiling. Arpaios officers called Latinos wetbacks, Mexican bitches, fucking Mexicans and stupid Mexicans, the Justice Department found, and Latino drivers were four to nine times as likely to be stopped by his officers as non-Latino drivers were. A lawsuit filed by the Justice Department was settled in 2015 . With his pardon of Arpaio, Trump has chosen lawlessness over justice, division over unity, hurt over healing, Cecillia Wang, deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement Friday. Once again, the president has acted in support of illegal, failed immigration enforcement practices that target people of color and have been struck down by the courts. His pardon of Arpaio is a presidential endorsement of racism. Arpaio took a break from dinner with his wife on Friday night to call into Sean Hannitys program on Fox News. Hannity said Arpaio was convicted ... only of criminal contempt and said he was very relieved for Arpaio. Arpaio said that it was great to hear about the pardon and that he loves the president. Hannity, who apparently thought that a former sheriff charged with a federal crime would have somehow landed in his former county jail, joked with Arpaio about the conditions in Arpaios former facility, referencing pink underwear and the bologna sandwiches served there. But Arpaio said incarceration wouldnt have been that big of a deal. Sean, its federal, I could play bocce. ... It wouldve been alright, he said. At a Tuesday evening rally in Phoenix, Trump had signaled that the pardon was coming . The president claimed Arpaio had beenconvicted for doing his job. But Trump said,Ill make a prediction: I think hes going to be just fine, OK? Ahead of his trial, the Justice Department had argued that Arpaio viewed his defiance of the federal governments directives on immigration as a badge of honor and bragged about his deputies contemptuous immigration enforcement practices to the press. In finding Arpaio guilty of criminal contempt, U.S. District Judge Susan R. Bolton said in July that the former sheriff had shownflagrant disregard for the 2011 order banning him from detaining people because he thought they were in the country illegally. Not only did Defendant abdicate responsibility, he announced to the world and to his subordinates that he was going to continue business as usual no matter who said otherwise, Bolton ruled on July 31. The evidence at trial proves beyond a reasonable doubt and the Court finds that Judge Snow issued a clear and definite order enjoining Defendant from detaining persons for further investigation without reasonable suspicion that a crime has been or is being committed; that Defendant knew of the order; and that Defendant willfully violated the order by failing to do anything to ensure his subordinates compliance and by directing them to continue to detain persons for whom no criminal charges could be filed. Arpaios lawyers have since moved for an acquittal , arguing that the governments handling of the case reeked of unconstitutional selective prosecution.They questioned the courts motivations in not allowing a jury trial.They also claimed that the verdict was driven by the desire to vindicate the authority of a fellow judge. And they argued that Arpaio had a right to be present for the issuing of the verdict, which was in fact emailed to his lawyers. The prosecution has not yet responded to the defenses motion. Trumps pardon of Arpaio skipped over the typical review process for pardons , which are usually routed through the Justice Departments Office of the Pardon Attorney. The pardon came less than two weeks after the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that turned deadly when a neo-Nazi sympathizer crashed his vehicle into a crowd of anti-racist demonstrators. Trump faced criticism for what was seen as his lackluster condemnation of white supremacists and his attempt to equate the racists in Charlottesville with those who turned out to oppose them. Civil rights advocates like Vanita Gupta, the former chief of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division, warned that pardoning Arpaio <U+2015> who she said  personifies the same bigotry and intolerance we witnessed in Charlottesville <U+2015> would sow hate and division. If President Trump uses his power to pardon a discredited law enforcement official who persistently engaged in illegal racial profiling of the Latino community, it will not be a dog whistle to the so-called alt right and white supremacists, but a bull horn, Gupta said.

Daniel Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley, told Trump in a letter dated Wednesday that his decision to quit his State Department post is in response to your attacks on core values of the United States. As one example, he cited Trumps reaction to the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia , calling the responseconsistent with a broader pattern of behavior that enables sexism and racism. But its Kammens acrostic  the first letter of each paragraph spelling out a word  that sends a blunter message to Trump: IMPEACH. Kammen noted in his letter that he has served the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the State Department in a number of roles since 1996. The Science Envoy program , which he was a member of, brings together U.S. scientists and engineers to identify opportunities for sustained international cooperation. Kammen is one of seven envoys listed on the State Department website. They typically serve in the position for about a year. Julia Mason, a State Department spokeswoman, called Kammens resignation a personal decision. We appreciate his dedicated service to U.S. scientific diplomacy during his appointment working on energy efficiency and renewable energy in Africa as a Science Envoy, she added. Neither Kammen nor a White House spokesperson could be reached for comment. The fallout from Trumps response to the Charlottesville violence <U+2015> he repeatedly suggested that those counterprotesting the white supremacists shared the blame for the clashes <U+2015> has already been swift. Multiple members of two White House advisory boards resigned in protest of the presidents comments,and he officially disbanded the councils. Kammen in his letter also pointed to Trumps efforts to undermine energy and environmental research, as well as his decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Accord on combating climate change, as moves he finds unacceptable. He said that Trumps actions to date have, sadly, harmed the quality of life in the United States, our standing abroad, and the sustainability of the planet.

59,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kasowitz-threatens-stranger_us_5967dfa4e4b0d6341fe7aaea","This story has been updated with a response from a spokesman for Marc Kasowitz. Marc Kasowitz, President Trump s personal attorney on the Russia case, threatened a stranger in a string of profanity-laden emails Wednesday night. The man, a retired public relations professional in the western United States who asked not to be identified, read ProPublicas story this week on Kasowitz and sent the lawyer an email with the subject line: Resign Now. Kasowitz replied with series of angry messages sent between 9:30 p.m. and 10 p.m. Eastern time. One read: Im on you now. You are fucking with me now Lets see who you are Watch your back , bitch. In another email, Kasowitz wrote: Call me. Dont be afraid, you piece of shit. Stand up. If you dont call, youre just afraid. And later: I already know where you live, Im on you. You might as well call me. You will see me. I promise. Bro. Kasowitzs spokesman, Michael Sitrick, said Thursday he couldnt immediately reach Kasowitz for comment. ProPublica confirmed the mans phone number matched his stated identity. Technical details in the emails, such as IP addresses and names of intermediate mail servers, also show the emails came from Kasowitzs firm. In one email, Kasowitz gave the man a cell phone number that is not widely available. We confirmed Kasowitz uses that number. The exchange began after the man saw our story featured last night on the Rachel Maddow show on MSNBC. We reported that Kasowitz is not seeking a security clearance even though the Russia case involves a significant amount of classified material. Experts said Kasowitz could have trouble getting a security clearance because of what multiple sources described as a recent history of alcohol abuse. Former employees also said Kasowitz had engaged in behavior that made them uncomfortable. Since the story was published, his spokesman issued a statement disputing several parts of the story: Marc Kasowitz has not struggled with alcoholism, Sitrick wrote. He has not come into the office intoxicated, attorneys have not had to go across the street to the restaurant during the workday to consult Kasowitz on work matters. The rigorous background investigation that goes into getting security clearance also considers any information relevant to strength of character, honesty, discretion, sound judgment, [and] reliability. The exchange of emails Wednesday began at 9:28 p.m. Eastern when the man sent the following message to Kasowitzs firm account. Five minutes later, Kasowitz responded with two words: Fifteen minutes after that, Kasowitz sent a second email: The man responded politely: But Kasowitz continued to harangue him: And then, just 33 minutes after the mans initial email, Kasowitz sent a fourth response, referring to his own Jewish heritage and the mans name, which he presumed to be Jewish. The man told us that the email exchange disturbed him so greatly he forwarded it to the FBI so there would be a written record in case Kasowitz followed through on the threat. Experts in the laws on harassment and online threats differed on whether Kasowitzs emails could put him in legal jeopardy. When considering whether words constitute a true threat versus protected speech, the threat has to be credible and the person has to intend to make the victim fear imminent physical harm, said Danielle Citron, a University of Maryland law professor and author of a book on online harassment. Citron pointed in particular to Kasowitzs statements: I already know where you live and you will see me. I promise. She said: Thats incredibly troubling language. If Im a prosecutor Im going to think hard about that. Ron Kuby, a New York lawyer who argued a case that overturned a portion of the states harassment law on free speech grounds, said he believed Kasowitz had not violated the law with his missives. When Kasowitz says things like I already know where you live he is inching closer to the line. But in my view  as someone who despises the Trump administration, but who has litigated these issues  he is well on the legal side of the line. For over 15 years, Trump has periodically retained Kasowitz, who has cultivated a tough-guy image. The New York Times reported this week that the relationship between Kasowitz and the Trump White House had soured and that Kasowitz could resign. Kasowitzs spokesman told ProPublica Wednesday: The NYT story is not accurate. Kasowitzs firm was also sued for malpractice this week by a former client in a billing dispute. Update, July 13, 2017: A spokesman for Marc Kasowitz sent ProPublica this statement: Mr. Kasowitz, who is tied up with client matters, said he intends to apologize to the writer of the email referenced in todays ProPublica story.While no excuse, the email came at the end of a very long day that at 10 p.m. was not yet over.The person sending that email is entitled to his opinion and I should not have responded in that inappropriate manner, Mr. Kasowitz said. I intend to send him an email stating just that. This is one of those times where one wishes he could reverse the clock, but of course I cant. Jeremy Merrill and Jesse Eisinger contributed reporting.

Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.) took a victory lap in her feud with President Donald Trump after the White House was caught falsely maligning her for the second time this week. Twice this week the White House accused Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.)of lying and each time the facts have vindicated her version of events. Most recently,evidence emerged disproving an accusation by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly that Wilson had gloated over securing funds for an FBI building in her district. Earlier this week, Wilson escalated a political firestorm over President Donald Trump s response to the deaths of four American military service members in Niger. After bragging of his willingness to call the families of fallen troops, Trump spoke with the loved ones of the most recent casualties, including Myeshia Johnson, the widow of Army Sgt. La David Johnson, and a constituent of Wilsons. Wilson, who was with Johnson when Trump called and heard the conversation on speakerphone, said Tuesday that Trump had told Johnson that her husband mustve known what he signed up for. The comments during a condolence call, Wilson said,showed that Trump has no feelings for anyone. Trump responded the following morning by alleging that Wilson totally fabricated the conversation and claiming he had proof that her version of events was not true. Then, on Thursday, La David Johnsons mother Cowanda Jones-Johnson , who said she was also present during the call, corroborated Wilsons version of events. Yes, the statement is true,Jones-Johnson said. I was in the car and I heard the full conversation. Caught in a lie, the White House, which had never offered evidence to contradict Wilsons description, quickly shifted its public relations strategy. In remarks to the White House press corps on Thursday, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly suggested that Trump spoke appropriately. Kelly, whose own son died serving in Afghanistan, recalled his sons commanding officer saying something similar. He knew what he was getting himself into, Kelly said, quoting his sons commanding officer. It was exactly where he wanted to be. That was the message. But in keeping with Trumps relentless combat with critics, Kelly could not resist taking another false potshot at Wilson. As part of a larger attempt to paint Wilson as a political showboat, Kelly alleged that Wilson had taken credit for securing the federal funding for the construction of a new FBI building in Miramar, Florida. Kelly was present at the 2015 ceremony dedicating the building in his capacity as head of the U.S. militarys Southern Command. A congresswoman stood up, and in a long tradition of empty barrels making the most noise, stood up there in all of that and talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building, and how she took care of her constituents because she got the money, and she just called up President Obama, and on that phone call, he gave the money, the $20 million, to build the building, and she sat down, Kelly said. Here too, Kelly was either gravely mistaken or deliberately lying. The legislation allotting the federal funds for the creation of the building passed Congress in 2010, shortly before Wilson began her first term in office, McClatchy reported on Friday. Instead, Wilson drew praise at the ceremony from Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (Fla.) and then-FBI director James Comey for pushing through legislation naming the buildings after two deceased FBI agents. Wilson during her ceremony speech took credit for ensuring that the buildings were named after the agents, but not for securing the funding, according to a video of the event obtained by the Sun-Sentinel .

The governors comment came in response to a question about how Republicans should react to Alabama politician Roy Moore securing their partys nomination for that states open Senate seat. Moore is a former judge who was twice removed from Alabamas Supreme Court for violating legal standards, and Tapper noted that he has said homosexual conduct should be illegal, questioned the birthplace of former President Barack Obama and suggested Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) should not be allowed a position in Congress because he is a practicing Muslim. Well, look, I dont run the party. I can tell you for me, I dont support that. I couldnt vote for that. I dont know what the heck I would have to do, but I dont live in that state. I mean, those claims are <U+2015> I mean, theyre ludicrous and theyre divisive, Kasich said, adding that the party needs to be fixed to limit the influence of far-right elements and he sees his job as trying to get that done. The governor said he hopes figures like Moore do not represent the GOPs future. Tapper explicitly asked if Kasich might split from the GOP if it continues being associated with figures like Moore. No, not at this... the governor responded, trailing off as if to hint that a time may come when he would consider parting ways with GOP. What Im saying to you is, we need to fix it. If our party, if the Republican Party is going to be anti-immigration, if its not going to be worried about debt, if its going to be anti-trade, this is not where our party can be. So Im going to fight like everything I have... its why Im on these shows, because I want this party to be straightened out. But I not only want the party to be straightened out, I want the country to be straightened out. And so its really a battle again inside of both parties, but people are beginning to say, I dont like either of them. And that says something big. So hopefully our party leaders will pay attention to this. Despite his criticisms of President Donald Trump , Kasich retains influence in the party because of his popularity in Ohio and is seen as a standard-bearer for GOP centrists distressed by Trumps rise. Hes also cultivated an image as a uniter, in contrast to Trumps divisiveness, reaching out to Democrats on issues like health care reform. The governor recently ruled out rumors of his running in 2020 on a joint ticket with Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado. He has left the door open to running for the presidency next time around.",1,61.56,9.2,11.1,525,29,"John Kasich Hints That He May Need To Leave The GOP",2017-10-01 13:25:00,"Akbar Shahid Ahmed","Politics","@amazonecho,@bustournewsletter,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_national_beats,donald-trump,jake-tapper,john-hickenlooper,john-kasich,political-science,republican-party,republican-politics,roy-moore,type: news,us-news,us-presidential-elections",321980,299722,321980,242640,78379,194532,1.052,1.079,0.87,0.912,121593,165691,34696,14451,124513,72855,47833,33116,26174,6710,1,9,22020,20892,1101,9,18,"John Kasich Hints That He May Need To Leave The GOP",2017-10-01 13:25:00,"Akbar Shahid Ahmed","Politics","@amazonecho,@bustournewsletter,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_national_beats,donald-trump,jake-tapper,john-hickenlooper,john-kasich,political-science,republican-party,republican-politics,roy-moore,type: news,us-news,us-presidential-elections",321980,299722,321980,242640,78379,194532,1.052,1.079,0.87,0.912,121593,165691,34696,14451,124513,72855,47833,33116,26174,6710,1,9,22020,20892,1101,9,18

The tweet came from a user named @Fuctupmind, whose Twitter bio indicates that he wants Clinton to be in prison and believes the conspiracy theory that Democrats had something to do with the death of former Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich . It was not unusual to see violent and misogynistic imagery directed at Clinton at Trump rallies during the 2016 presidential campaign. Last week, Clinton noted that there was significant criticism directed toward comedian Kathy Griffin when she held up a fake decapitated head of Trump <U+2015> and added that she didnt remember the same outcry over images of her. We recently had this big kerfuffle <U+2015> this condemnation of Kathy Griffin <U+2015> for the picture she had of herself holding a head of Trump like a play on Perseus holding the head of Medusa, Clinton said. They were selling T-shirts and mugs at the Republican [National] Convention with Trump holding my head . Nobody said a word. Not a word! HuffPost reporters never saw that specific image mentioned by Clinton, but we did see T-shirts of Trump punching out Clinton in a boxing ring and the Democratic presidential candidate falling off a motorcycle. Its not unusual for Trump to retweet random accounts, occasionally including users who have anti-Semitic views . As BuzzFeed noted, Fuctupmind has also tweeted anti-Semitic and anti-LGBTQ messages.

63,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-tax-bill-pass_us_5a395ec8e4b0c65287acc5f5","WASHINGTON <U+2015> After years of false starts and failed promises <U+2015> including another one Tuesday when House Republicans passed a tax bill with provisions that were struck down by the Senate parliamentarian <U+2015> House Republicans once again passed the final version of the GOP tax bill Wednesday , sending the bill to President Donald Trumps desk. Even though House Republicans had already passed a nearly identical form of this bill, and had already congratulated themselves in a series of speeches Tuesday, the House voted again Wednesday, 224-201, to pass the tax bill, this time with the stricken provisions omitted. The Senate passed this version of the bill on a party-line, 51-48 vote early Wednesday morning. House Republicans had passed what they thought would be the final tax proposal on Tuesday , 227-203, with 12 Republicans voting no.The bill passed Wednesday with the same 12 Republicans voting no, but with three absences on the GOP side and four absences on the Democratic side. It was a small gaffe that led House lawmakers to need to vote again, but one typical of this process. Republicans rushed a bill to the floor and ended up embarrassing themselves. Still, the hiccup was just a formality. Even though the Senate parliamentarian struck down college savings provisions benefiting home-schooled children <U+2015> a provision important to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) <U+2015> the bill still flew through the Senate late Tuesday night into Wednesday morning and had no trouble on Wednesday in the House. The bill is, without a doubt, Trump and the GOP Congresss most significant legislative achievement since Republicans gained control of the House, Senate and White House. But the win may end up costing Republicans. This bill is far from the congressional victory Republicans had sought to run on during next years midterm elections: Its deeply unpopular, with approval ratings that were already significantly under water and grew worse over the past few weeks as the legislation neared final passage. A CNN poll in November showed 31 percent of voters viewing the tax bill favorably, with 45 percent opposing it. A poll conducted in the past week showed 33 percent supporting the bill, but 55 percent now against it. When Senate Republicans passed their initial version of the measure just a few weeks ago, many Republicans didnt care that the bill wasnt popular. Republicans simply believed the lack of support was due to bad polling and voters not fully understanding the proposal. Likewise, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told reporters Tuesday morning that he had no concerns whatsoever. I got to say, if people are out there on TV telling mistruths, disguising the facts of this thing, thats going to make it unpopular, Ryan said, adding that taxpayers will be happy when they see changes in their pay next year <U+2015> both from adjustments to taxes withheld from their paychecks and higher pay from booming business conditions. But the facts of this bill are what make it unpopular. For one, the bill repeals the individual mandate in Obamacare, which would result in higher prices for people relying on Obamacare for health insurance. And far from a middle-class tax cut, as Trump and other Republicans promised, the measure is truly a massive corporate tax cut <U+2015> the top rate goes down from 35 percent to 21 percent <U+2015> and a smaller tax cut for individuals in the seven individual income brackets. Independent analysts have said wealthy taxpayers would benefit the most, in large part because they pay more taxes from the start. But households at every income level would see a tax cut next year, according to an analysis of the conference bill from the Joint Committee on Taxation, which scores tax legislation for Congress. Starting in 2021, however, some income groups would start seeing slightly higher rates. And because the proposal sets most individual cuts to expire in eight years <U+2015> a budget gimmick to reduce the bills cost in a 10-year budget window <U+2015> all households earning less than $75,000 would see higher taxes in 2027(due in large part to the bill including an unfavorable permanent change to the way tax brackets are indexed to inflation) Republicans have waved off concerns about the sunsetting tax cuts by saying a future Congress wont let them expire. Thats a change from Ryans position earlier this year, when he insisted the cuts be permanent. In the end, Ryan got half his way <U+2015> the corporate tax cuts are permanent, but the individual reductions are not. Republicans finance these cuts, in part, by raising taxes on some people. The bill ends much of the state and local tax deduction, which lets filers write off the cost of their local taxes. As a compromise to some of the high-tax states most affected, the bill allows filers to deduct up to $10,000 of their local taxes by some combination of their choice. But that wont be enough for many high-income people in states like New Jersey, New York and California. As with an earlier version of the bill, a number of Republicans from New Jersey and New York voted against the legislation, though most California Republicans still got onboard. Republicans chose a policy approach that came with a built-in political headache: They have been unable to guarantee that no household would face higher taxes under the plan even as it piles on all that debt. If their bill simply cut tax rates, everybody would benefit. But because of the way the bill lowers rates while eliminating deductions <U+2015> thereby exposing more income to taxation in some cases <U+2015> Republicans have been unable guarantee a tax cut for everybody. So even though most households would be better off under the changes next year, some will be worse off. Still, the majority of the bill is paid for by increasing deficits. The measure would add $1.4 trillion to the national debt,the Joint Committee on Taxation said. Republicans have claimed that increased economic growth would boost business receipts and offset the revenue loss, though no credible economic analysis has shown that. Republicans have largely ignored those criticisms by just focusing on how the tax cuts would boost the economy. Theyve also largely looked past the effects on housing, charitable giving and state budgets. Those effects flow from a simplification of the tax code. The legislation would increase the standard deduction from $12,700 to $24,000 for a married couple (an increase Republicans have falsely characterized as doubling the deduction ). Currently, only about 30 percent of households find it worthwhile to itemize for expenses such as mortgage interest, charitable donations and local taxes. With the bigger standard deduction, experts say only 5 percent would. While their tax filing process would be simpler, for many households, the tax incentive to take out a bigger mortgage or donate to charity would be smaller, which could squeeze housing markets and the nonprofit sector. And a new cap on the amount of local taxes that can be deducted would put pressure on state lawmakers to either reduce those taxes <U+2015> resulting in less revenue for priorities like public education <U+2015> or shift them to other sources that are still deductible, such as business payrolls. Dont be a high-tax state, Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.) said after the vote. Be a low-tax state  According to Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the Senate parliamentarian said three provisions were ineligible for the fast-track process, including one measure allowing parents to use special 529 savings accounts for home-schooling expenses. In the mad dash to provide tax breaks for their billionaire campaign contributors, our Republican colleagues forgot to comply with the rules of the Senate, Wyden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said in a joint statement. The lead House author of the bill, Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), has said he expects Congress will need to pass another bill next year to fix any mistakes in the tax bill .

64,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/harvard-kennedy-sean-spicer-students_us_59e8d273e4b06b440e446d10","Sean Spicer, a man most famous for lying compulsively and giving Hitler the benefit of the doubt , has been rewarded for his brief stint as White House press secretary with a prestigious fellowship at the Institute of Politics at Harvards John F. Kennedy School of Government for the fall semester. His appointment was in keeping with the trend of Americas broadly liberal institutions falling all over themselves to give a prominent platform to our countrys worst, most illiberal voices, in an idiot kabuki of broadmindedness. According to the institute , Spicer is supposed to be engaging students in discourse on topical issues of today by giving bright young minds a look at the inner workings of White House communications. Instead, according to a student who attended one of Spicers Q&A sessions, The entire thing was just a defense of every waking moment he served. He is a flack once more, only this time for himself. Over the course of this week, Spicer has been holding court during breakfasts, lunches, dinners and lectures to pass along to the groups of commingling graduate and undergrad students the many lessons of public service he digested along with all those pieces of gum in his time at the White House. HuffPost spoke with several of these students, who have been granted anonymity because the sessions were off the record,per the Harvard institutes standard visiting fellow rules. The school probably didnt need to worry too much. As one student explained,Hes incredibly inarticulate, so it was really difficult to take any sort of notes. The Harvard Kennedy School features a mostly liberal student body, and its students were particularly upset over the schools decision to rescind Chelsea Mannings fellowship while keeping that of both Spicer and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Despite that,everyone HuffPost spoke with said the questions Spicer received were relatively tame. No questions were pre-screened, but the sessions moderators had full control over who was able to get in a question. Spicer, for his part, had his talking points ready.The students HuffPost spoke with emphasized that, regardless of the question, Spicer tended to circle back to a few familiar themes. Benghazi, for instance. Here are a few lessons Spicer imparted to the public servants of tomorrow,paraphrased by two students who attended several of Spicers sessions: On politics today A lot of the problems in politics today come from the fact that we dont take the time to understand each other, and that we should listen first and then protest.If you dialogue with a politician on the other side, youre seen as a sellout by your own party. On the media Politico recently did an article on me, and they said that I was a press secretary when I was in the RNC, and if they cant get that right then what can they get right? [Spicer was the RNCs communications director.] One New York Times reporter had said to me, How can you face the fact that you work for a racist fascist? That reporter cant possibly have been objective because he holds those views, and more broadly the media was incredibly biased in covering Trump. On why the Trump administration keeps lying Were you upset when Benghazi was blamed on a video by Jay Carney, Hillary Clinton and Susan Rice? There were no challenges from the media then. The Trump administration is being held to an unfair higher standard. Well, Obama promised that with Obamacare you wouldnt have to switch your doctor, but you did. On why Sean Spicer, specifically, lied Im a spokesperson for the president, and my job is to say what he wants me to say. I said in the first press conference that the inauguration was witnessed by the most people ever, so I was also talking about social media and online reporting of the inauguration, not just crowd sizes, which are obviously hard to calculate. On the difference between alternative facts and lies An alternative fact is 3+1=4 or 4+0=4. Those are alternative facts. A lie is 3+2=4. Alternative facts are legitimate tools to use in politics. On what Sean Spicer regrets I regret a lot of things. I regret things every day of my life, and I apologize. On the difference between working for the RNC and working for the White House Not much. On Sean Spicers proudest White House moment My proudest moment as press secretary was getting the opportunity to give people tours of the White House. On Sean Spicers coolest White House moment The coolest moment as press secretary was having the New England Patriots all standing in my office waiting to go meet the president. When I was growing up, I had to sit in the middle bleachers and watch them from the stadium. Now I have the whole starting lineup in my office and got to take a selfie with them before they met Trump. On White House press briefings White House press briefings are a waste of time. Reporters had the chance to go and knock on my door and see me any time, but they would only ask questions during the White House press briefing so they could be on camera. They could have asked me at any other time of the day.[HuffPost White House reporter S.V. Date reports thatthe door was almost always closed. You needed his gatekeepers permission to get in. I never got permission.] On life after the White House I will continue to support the Trump agenda. Ive been at Harvard three days and no one has said anything negative publicly to my face. All very illuminating.Weve reached out to Spicer for comment and will update if he responds. Lets not forget, though, that this is about the students. And what are the students taking away from this encounter with a master of his field? I learned that the media was not misrepresenting him in how they were talking about him six months ago, said one Harvard Kennedy School student. I was kind of expecting him to be better than how he was portrayed through the press, but he was pretty much just as slimy and weaselly as Id thought he was.",0,69.11,8.3,10.9,1027,54,"Harvard Students Told Us What They're Learning From Sean Spicer",2017-10-20 18:31:00,"Ashley Feinberg","Politics","@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_national_beats,harvard-university,john-f-kennedy-school-of-government,must-reads,political-science,sean-spicer,type: news,us-news,white-house,white-house-press-secretary",320889,291808,320889,363664,39556,168010,1.058,1.078,1.679,1.794,93772,189332,37785,36159,153290,16601,23120,68707,22879,45719,NA,4,9148,8005,1117,4,22,"Harvard Students Told Us What They're Learning From Sean Spicer",2017-10-20 18:31:00,"Ashley Feinberg","Politics","@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_national_beats,harvard-university,john-f-kennedy-school-of-government,must-reads,political-science,sean-spicer,type: news,us-news,white-house,white-house-press-secretary",320889,291808,320889,363664,39556,168010,1.058,1.078,1.679,1.794,93772,189332,37785,36159,153290,16601,23120,68707,22879,45719,NA,4,9148,8005,1117,4,22

66,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scaramucci-post-jews-killed-holocaust_us_59e5fb0ae4b0ca9f483ad4d6","Anthony Scaramuccis new media organization is sparking outrage for asking readers how many Jews they thought had been murdered during the Holocaust. Twitter users accused The Scaramucci Post, which President Donald Trumps former communications director launched in September , of pandering to Holocaust deniers by asking its 24,000-plus Twitter followers this question on Tuesday morning: Around 6 millions Jews were systematically murdered during the genocide instigated under Adolf Hitlers Nazi Germany before and during World War II. But The Scaramucci Post question appears to suggest with its multiple-choice options that the total number of Jews killed may have been fewer than 1 million. Heres how the first 4,577 respondents voted: The poll question was taken down after around 90 minutes. The Scaramucci Posts Twitter account, according to its bio page, is run by hedge fund manager Lance Laifer. A subsequent tweet on Tuesday said that Laifer was behind the Holocaust question, and that Scaramucci was not aware of it. That failed to dampen the outrage expressed by tweeters: Scaramucci tweeted late Tuesday afternoon that he would make a $25,000 donation to the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which is named after a Nazi hunter .He said he was out of the country when the poll went live on Twitter. I was not aware of [Laifers] actions and as soon as I found out, I had it removed immediately, he said in a statement posted to Twitter. I am pained imagining that my post led anyone to believe I am giving comfort to Holocaust deniers. Nothing can be further from the truth.

Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) introduced the resolution on Friday. Should the results of said exam be unfavorable, the resolution calls for Vice President Mike Pence and members of the Cabinet to remove Trump from office. The move would invoke the 25th Amendment , a rarely used constitutional provision that allows the vice president and a majority of Cabinet members to jointly remove the president from office and replace him with the vice president. In a statement announcing the resolution, Lofgren asked if the president suffers from early stage dementia. Has emotional disorder so impaired the President that he is unable to discharge his duties, she continued. Is the President mentally and emotionally stable? Lofgren pointed out that Trump has not yet released a serious medical evaluation to the public. Lofgren, who represents Californias 19th District,is not a professional psychiatrist or psychologist , according to Mercury News. She doesnt expect the resolution to pass, but she told the newspaper it will stimulate conversation, adding that Trump would get the evaluation if he cares about the country. Lofgren has often criticized Trumps remarks and policies throughout his presidency. The representative suggested on Tuesday that something is seriously wrong with President Trump, responding to his off-the-cuff remarks on the Charlottesville white supremacist riot made during an impromptu Q&A with reporters in New York . Why cant he just condemn Nazis, she asked on Twitter. Unscripted words today show who he really is. Shameful! Lofgren isnt the first politician or critic to suggest invoking the 25th Amendment to boot the 45th president out of the White House. In June, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) led 25 House Democrats to co-sign a bill that would create a congressional commission able to oust Trump from the Oval Office under the amendment. Commenting on his bill, Raskin told Yahoo News in case of emergency, break glass. Articles and op-eds exploring the 25th Amendment in detail have also been published in the Washington Post , Rolling Stone , New York Times and Time Magazine since Trump took office. Meanwhile, Trump has continued to draw ire across the country for issues such as his harsh policies on immigration, his travel bans agains people from predominantly Muslim countries,his push to pass health care bills that would lead to millions losing coverage and his remarks suggesting there werefine people among those attending a white supremacist rally. This summer, the hashtag #25thAmendment began trending on Twitter. Thats why Lofgren is calling for Pence and other Cabinet members to quickly secure ... medical and psychiatric professionals to evaluate Trumps mental health and any possible impairments. If it was a physical ailment, you would be getting the advice of doctors, Lofgren told Mercury News. The same thing should be true to take a look at his stability here.

The Atlantic reported Saturday that their reporters had spoken to three Gold Star families who received condolence packages from the president this week. Timothy Eckels Sr., whose son Timothy Eckels Jr. was killed when the USS John S. McCain collided with a merchant ship in August, told the magazine he had not heard from Trump until Friday, Oct. 20.His letter from the White House was dated Oct. 18. The families of Corey Ingram and John M. Hoagland III,two other sailors who died in the USS John McCain collision, also received rush-delivered packages from the White House this week, according to the Atlantic. The sudden outreach appears to follow mounting criticism over Trumps reaction to the Niger ambush that killed four U.S.soldiers. When asked during a Monday press conference why he hadnt publicly acknowledged the deaths in Niger, Trump pitted himself against past presidents, saying he had written the soldiers families personal letters, while President Obama and other presidents ... didnt make calls. On Tuesday, Trump followed up that remark by claiming he had calledvirtually all Gold Star families who had lost kin since he took office. To the best of my knowledge I think Ive called every family of somebody whos died, Trump told Fox News Brian Kilmeade during a radio interview . Its the hardest call to make ... the hardest thing for me to do is to do that. He later hedged his claim to Kilmeade saying, I have called, I believe, everybody <U+2015> but certainly Ill use the word virtually everybody. Hours after that Oct. 17 radio broadcast, the White House scrambled to identify and find the contact information for Gold Star families who lost a service member since January,according to an internal Defense Department email obtained by political news site Roll Call. The email exchange, between the White House and the Pentagon, revealed that senior White House aides knew Trumps statement about having called virtually all Gold Star families was not accurate <U+2015> and they needed to correct it as soon as possible. The White House was attempting to find out which Gold Star families Trump had not yet reached out to, according to Roll Call. Multiple news outlets have found Trump has yet to reach out to a number of families who lost loved ones since January. In a report published Wednesday, the Washington Post interviewed the families of 13 service members who were killed after Trump took office: Half of the families received phone calls from the president, the remainder had not heard from Trump. The Associated Press reported it had reached out to the families of all 43 people who have died in military service since Trump became president, but only made contact with about half of the families. Some families told AP they were comforted by Trumps call, while others hadnt heard from the president. The family of Army Sgt. Jonathon M. Hunter, who died in a suicide bombing in Afghanistan in August,was promised a call from the president but instead heard from Vice President Mike Pence. Brittany Harris, the widow of Army Spc. Christopher Michael Harris who also died in Afghanistan in August, said she had not heard from the president either. AP identified at least two other Gold Star families who had wanted, but did not receive a call from the president.",1,59.84,9.8,12.5,593,30,"Report: White House Rushed Condolences To Gold Star Families",2017-10-21 23:36:00,"Carla Herreria","Politics","@ads_scary,@health_adhd,@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@health_pain,@team_us_news_trends,donald-trump,gold-star,republican-politics,type: news,us-news,white-house",319354,288971,319354,213736,31846,146343,1.057,1.118,1.039,1.207,82315,199536,37503,67942,142992,13441,25836,45215,43026,2110,NA,14,23240,22945,237,2,56,"Report: White House Rushed Condolences To Gold Star Families",2017-10-21 23:36:00,"Carla Herreria","Politics","@ads_scary,@health_adhd,@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@health_pain,@team_us_news_trends,donald-trump,gold-star,republican-politics,type: news,us-news,white-house",319354,288971,319354,213736,31846,146343,1.057,1.118,1.039,1.207,82315,199536,37503,67942,142992,13441,25836,45215,43026,2110,NA,14,23240,22945,237,2,56

70,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-wave-2017_us_5a0267e1e4b092053058cdad","FAIRFAX, Va. <U+2015> The Democratic Party romped to victories across the country Tuesday, gaining key state legislative seats, two governorships and full control of the state governments of New Jersey and Washington, where theyll have wide power to enact their agenda. In one sense, the wins should have been expected: President Donald Trump is extremely unpopular , and the party that holds the White House usually does worse in congressional, state and local elections in years when the president isnt on the ballot. And the victories were expected in some cases. In New Jersey, Democrat Phil Murphy ,a former Goldman Sachs banker, consistently led in the polls and will now be the next governor. But elsewhere, outcomes were more uncertain. Many Democratic activists were worried that the party was going to let the Virginia governors mansion slip from its grasp. Concern that Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam was failing to excite the base, along with a fear-mongering anti-immigrant campaign run by Republican Ed Gillespie, led to concerns it would be a repeat of the 2016 presidential race. Northam, however, sailed to victory Tuesday , guaranteeing Democrats a seat at the table when state legislative and congressional districts get redrawn in 2020. The party won the races for lieutenant governor and attorney general, too. The night was validation for the many activists around the country who joined the resistance after Trumps win and have been feverishly working at the grassroots to mobilize the partys base. Theres no doubt that the victories will provide a jolt of energy for whats coming in the 2018 midterm elections. Todays progressive victories in Virginia make one thing clear: A newly awakened grassroots movement is rising up to reject Trumps politics of hate and reclaim political power, said Maria Urbina,the political director of the progressive Indivisible movement, which has more than 180 active groups in Virginia. Democrats also saw the wins as a rejection of the type of nationalism championed by Trump and his former aide, Breitbart News Executive Chairman Steve Bannon, who maintained that a win by Gillespie in Virginia would prove that Trumpism without Trump can show the way forward. Tonight, the message for Democrats and the country is that fear and division and hatred do not work, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) said. They dont work here in Virginia, and theyre not going to work in Virginia. Trump attempted to distance himself from the crushing GOP losses Tuesday night, tweeting from South Korea that Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for. Almost no one expected Democrats to do as well as they did in the Virginia House of Delegates. Democrats targeted the 17 GOP-held districts where Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton defeated Trump. Winning all of the seats would swing control of the chamber, but few thought it was possible. Republicans have controlled the states house of delegates for nearly two decades and held a 66-34 majority. The last time Democrats picked up more than one seat in the body was 2007, when they gained four . Last week, Virginia Democratic National Committeewoman Yasmine Taeb estimated that a pickup of six to eight seats would constitute a success. But by 9:30 p.m., Democrats had already picked up 14 Republican-held seats in the House of Delegates, with eight more in play. Northern Virginia, a Democratic stronghold, turned only bluer. Voters outside a polling location in Fairfax, which supported Clinton by a two-to-one margin in 2016, cited health care, education and Trump as top issues that drove them to the polls Tuesday. It seems like the other guy, Gillespie, hes being supported by Trump, and [the president] tweeted about him, Soleyman Ahmed, who voted for Northam, told HuffPost. Northam seems like hes a doctor, hes served in the government, hes got experience that could help. The electoral wave lifted the fortunes of even very left-wing candidates, including Democrat Lee Carter, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America and supporter of single-payer health care. He unseated GOP House Majority Whip Jackson Miller in Northern Virginias 50th District. Carter, a former Marine, failed to provide the state Democratic Party with daily updates about his campaign, prompting the party to deny him aid and go silent on his bid. The Washington, D.C., chapter of DSA stepped in to help with canvassing, and on Tuesday Carter won. In Virginias 13th District, outside Fredericksburg, voters ousted Republican Del. Bob Marshall, the author of the states bill to ban transgender people from using the bathrooms of their choice, and replaced him with Danica Roem, a transgender woman who ran on a platform of fixing the areas transit problems. Virginia Democratic Del. Charniele Herring said Roems victory sends a message to politicians that the politics of bigotry is over. Its not acceptable to voters. Chris Hurst , a former Roanoke news anchor whose girlfriend was fatally shot by a colleague on-air in 2015, beat an incumbent Republican in the states 12th District, which stretches from Blacksburg, the home of Virginia Tech, to the West Virginia border. This isnt a wave. This is a tsunami, said David Toscano, the Democratic leader in the Virginia House of Delegates. The wins in New Jersey, Virginia and Washington, where Democrats won a key Washington state Senate seat  and, with it, control of the only part of the state government they didnt already run  will have real policy consequences in the short term. Northam will be able to veto Republican legislation in Virginia, and Democratic pickups in the Virginia House of Delegates will give him much more leverage in the legislature. New Jersey, where Murphy ran on promises to legalize marijuana and introduce public banking will be under full Democratic control for the first time in nearly a decade.In Washington, Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee and the Democratic-controlled legislature will have much more freedom to enact their agenda. The election results will affect lives in other states, too. In Maine, voters approved a ballot measure expanding Medicaid to tens of thousands of people over the objections of Paul LePage, the states Republican governor.In New York City, Bill de Blasio  who achieved a longstanding liberal goal of creating a universal pre-kindergarten program  became the first Democratic mayor to win reelection since Ed Koch in 1985. The big question for Democrats now will be whether they can translate wins in this years elections to victories in next years congressional midterm elections. The Virginia electorate in 2017 is not the same territory as the battlegrounds Democrats will face next year  for one thing, Trump is more unpopular in the state than he is in the nation as a whole . And, as FiveThirtyEight recently noted , Virginias off-year results havent been so predictive as a barometer of each partys strength in the following midterm House races. But what Democrats hope is that the GOP loss in Virginia <U+2015> where Gillespie played up the nativist message popularized by Trump <U+2015> will make Republicans rethink their strategy. I think the appeal to the bad side of human instinct <U+2015> which Donald Trump did when he ran, and now Republicans are adopting <U+2015> does not serve America well, but wont serve them well either, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told HuffPost on Tuesday, before the results came in. Next up: A Dec. 12 special election for a U.S. Senate race in deep-red Alabama, where Roy Moore, a controversial-but-Republican judge , is narrowly leading former U.S. attorney Doug Jones, a Democrat, in the polls. But on Tuesday night, most Democrats were still focused on celebrating their victories, not preparing for the long slog ahead. The Democrats are like the field goal kicker whos missed three kicks in a row, said Jared Leopold, communications director for the Democratic Governors Association. Now weve made a few, and weve got our groove back. Welcome to the bounce-back, said Paul Kent, an elated union member who attended Northams victory party on Tuesday. People have been waiting for a day like today since Nov. 9. This was the real bellwether. The narrative is were coming. There is no apathy. Ariel Edwards-Levy and Daniel Marans contributed reporting.

He is sick of mind, impetuous, arrogant, belligerent and dangerous , Gordon Humphrey, who represented New Hampshire from 1979 to 1990, said in a letter to his states members of Congress obtained by Manchester ABC station WMUR. Humphrey, who vehemently opposed Trump in last years election, said the presidents comments threatening North Korea with  fire and fury  show that he is impaired by a seriously sick psyche and could lead the nation into nuclear war. In the letter, reprinted in the Concord Monitor, Humphrey wrote:  The president alone has the authority to launch nuclear weapons , the only restraint being the advice of senior advisors who might be present at the time of crisis, and Donald Trump has shown repeated contempt for informed and wise counsel. Humphrey said the presidents sick and reckless conduct could consume the lives of millions,and he should be relieved of his duties at the earliest possible date His letter calls on lawmakers to support legislation in the House, HR 1987 , which would create a commission to invoke the 25th Amendment and carry out a medical examination of the President to determine whether the President is mentally or physically unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office. Humphrey is already receiving pushback. Neither of the states two House representatives <U+2015> Annie Kuster and Carol Shea-Porter, both Democrats <U+2015> support the commission out of concern it would set a dangerous precedent, spokespeople said. The congresswoman agrees with Senator Humphrey that the Trump presidency has veered far off the rails , a spokeswoman for Shea-Porter told the Union Leader. However, she believes creating a commission to pass judgment on the Presidents mental health sets a potentially anti-democratic precedent. A local Republican was even more blunt. Well, I think the former senator is the one thats mentally unfit, Al Baldasaro, a Trump supporter who serves in the state House of Representatives, told WMUR.  I think he needs to go back into retirement .Baldasaro made headlines last year when he called for Hillary Clinton to be shot to death . Humphrey supported Ohio Gov. John Kasich during the Republican presidential primaries, but later quit the party in opposition to Trump, and ultimately endorsed Clinton.",1,45.59,13.2,14.6,383,15,"Former GOP Sen.

It was the fall of 1975, and the Columbia law student was interviewing for an internship at Weil, Gotshal & Manges, a prominent New York firm known for its prowess in antitrust litigation, the area of law hed decided was his future. As he walked into the mens room after his interview,he noticed a group of extremely tall men shuffle in behind him. One of them stepped up to the urinal next to him. It was Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the 7-foot-tall Los Angeles Lakers superstar. Kessler was stunned, even a little confused. Antitrust law and the world of professional sports had begun to overlap in the decade prior, when St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Curt Flood sued Major League Baseball to overturn the leagues reserve clause, which bound players to their teams <U+2015> and restricted their salaries <U+2015> unless they were traded. But u ntil the moment Abdul-Jabbar sidled up next to him at the urinal, Kessler hadnt realized that his firm was at the center of another major sports case: a lawsuit brought by Milwaukee Bucks guard Oscar Robertson, the head of the NBAs players union, that aimed to end the NBAs version of the reserve clause, which limited free agency rights and gave teams near-complete control over their players. Kessler was a sports fan, and had long harbored an urge to work in public service. Growing up in the Sea Gate neighborhood in the outer reaches of Brooklyn, he was hardly a hippie, but he found it impossible to ignore the civil rights, feminist and anti-war movements erupting around him. An accomplished student, Kessler felt called to use his abilities to do some good in the world, and he saw the law <U+2015> and antitrust law, specifically <U+2015> as a way to do that. But at a time when the U.S. government had found a renewed zeal for using antitrust law to take on giant corporate monopolies, hed never considered a future in sports law. Now he was surrounded by NBA players whod come to Manhattan to take part in Robertsons case. I remember going home to my wife and saying, Youre not going to believe who I saw in the mens room today, Kessler said. Kessler never actually worked on that Robertson case. But soon after it settled, he joined the firm full-time, and over the next four decades, he would establish a reputation as one of the nations pre-eminent sports lawyers <U+2015> a bulldog attorney willing to take up the cause of virtually any athlete who felt he (or she) had been wronged by the league above them. He began representing NBA players in the 1970s and NFL players in the 80s. He represented Freeman McNeil, the running back who sued the NFL in 1990, and won the 1992 decision that established free agency rights for professional football players. Hes worked on behalf of all four major mens professional sports unions and the United States womens national soccer team. He has counted Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing, Tom Brady and Bill Belichick among his clients. All of that has led to perhaps the biggest case of his career: Jenkins v. the NCAA. The case, which Kessler filed on behalf of three college athletes in 2014 , could upend major college sports as we know them. Although there have been other major lawsuits against the NCAA in recent years, none have targeted the entire system of college athletics quite like this one. Kessler and his plaintiffs arent seeking monetary damages. Instead, they want federal courts to rule that the existing model of major college sports <U+2015> specifically, mens basketball and football <U+2015> violates federal antitrust law. If they win, they could reshape the current collegiate sports structure, forcing schools and major conferences to finally pay athletes in their two biggest sports. But the case, like many of his previous battles in sports, isnt just about money: To Kessler, its fundamentally a fight for college athletes rights.  If we win, Kessler told HuffPost, it could make a big difference. The nature of Kesslers suit is a threat to the NCAA, but the real danger it poses stems directly from his involvement in it. The structure of professional sports gives athletes considerably less power than team owners and league executives. Over the last 40 years, though, Kessler has become athletes David to the leagues Goliath. Driven by a relentless belief that his clients are being wronged, he has used antitrust law to win ever-expanding rights for the players he represents. That instinct to do battle with the powerful was forged even before he stumbled into sports law.In 1976, Kessler and his fellow first-year law students at Columbia put on a musical. Kessler wrote a song to the tune of the Frank Sinatra number from the opening scene of Guys and Dolls, said his classmate Allan Van Fleet. The modified lyrics, Van Fleet recalled, took direct aim at IBM, the computing giant that was then at the center of one of the countrys largest-ever antitrust lawsuits. The course is antitrust, For me it is a must, Watching IBM go bust  Kessler sang. For Jeff it was a must, said Van Fleet, who also went into antitrust law. Some of us fell into it later. Kessler was kind of a young idiot savant in the antitrust world when he joined Weil, Gotshal & Manges full-time in 1977, said Jim Quinn, who worked on the Robertson case for the firm. Together, Quinn and Kessler built out the firms sports law and antitrust practice, taking up more NBA cases and a lawsuit filed by the North American Soccer League against the NFL. Eventually, they represented NFL and NHL players in labor disputes and court cases as well. Then, in 1990, Kessler and Quinn picked up their biggest case yet: a lawsuit filed by New York Jets running back Freeman McNeil, who alleged that the leagues restrictive free agency system artificially held down player salaries and violated federal antitrust laws. The NFLs case rested on the testimony of University of Iowa economics professor George Daly, who told the jury that his studies showed that free agency would spell economic ruin for the NFL, according to a Sports Illustrated account of the trial. But on Sept. 7, 1992, in a courtroom in Minneapolis, Kessler launched into a devastating examination of Dalys claims that destroyed the NFLs case. Kessler repeatedly forced Daly to admit that he had not studied several aspects of the NFLs economic system, including how much money owners diverted out of revenues and into their own salaries, or how free agency might impact NFL revenues and salaries. Kessler pointed to Dalys projections that free agency would have harmful effects on Major League Baseball, even though it hadnt then (it still hasnt now). And he forced Daly to admit that he hadnt even reviewed footballs financial statements or summaries. You are not an expert on statistics or on football, are you?<U+2033> Kessler asked near the end of his time with the witness, according to UPI reports from the time. No, I am not an expert on football, Daly said. Then why do you say changing the [free agency] system in football would hurt the competitive balance of the game? Kessler asked. I would defer to the football people on why they think that is important, Daly said. It was a devastating encounter for the NFL. Four days later, the jury ruled that the league had violated antitrust laws, a decision that led to the creation of its modern free agency system. Hes very difficult to outdo, Quinn said of Kessler. Hes quick on his feet, he comes up with very persuasive and sometimes novel theories and arguments, and they have a tendency to stick. One reason Kessler has emerged as perhaps the most successful labor-side lawyer in sports is his belief in the righteousness of the cause athletes are fighting, said DeMaurice Smith, the executive director of the NFL Players Association, for which Kessler serves as outside counsel. You can find a lot of lawyers who certainly possess the expertise to fight the cause, Smith said. But you either have the passion for the morality of the cause, or you dont. In 2008, Kessler helped Oscar Pistorius , the South African sprinter born without the bottom halves of his legs, win the right to compete against able-bodied athletes at the Olympics, a case he considers a big win for disability rights. Kessler is also currently representing members of the U.S. womens national soccer team, who shortly after winning the 2015 World Cup filed a lawsuit against their governing body in an effort to win equal pay to their male counterparts. That case, Kessler says, has a lot of meaning for the equal pay movement generally, way beyond sports, and even internationally. (Indeed: U.S. senators and other equal pay advocates have continually highlighted the case as an example for the broader push for equal pay legislation.) Representing players in fights over money and, as he terms it, greater economic rights in their sports, is another front in that battle <U+2015> my way of fulfilling my initial goals to do cases that I think are protecting a group of people who are often mistreated, he says. The suit against the NCAA <U+2015> like those against the NFL and NBA before it <U+2015> is not a discrimination case. But its impossible to ignore its racial implications. A majority of the athletes in Division I mens college basketball and football, Kessler notes, are African American, while the people who reap the financial rewards of the current system <U+2015> college administrators, athletic directors, television executives and coaches <U+2015> are primarily white men. A lot of the athletes in both of those sports are African American, he says. That is the reality. And a lot of these players, both white and black, come from fairly impoverished backgrounds. So the fact that theyre exploited this way ... is a social justice issue. At times, the passion that feeds Kesslers often-acerbic tongue has earned the ire of his opponents at the bargaining table, and even those in the sports media. In 2011, during a bitter labor dispute between the NBA and its players union, Kessler and NBA Commissioner David Sterns relationship boiled over after Kessler accused NBA owners of treating their players  like plantation workers . Stern, who through an NBA spokesperson declined requests to comment for this article, told The Washington Post then that Kessler was  the single most divisive force  in the negotiating process, and that his conduct was routinely despicable. Anonymous sources from the players union even distanced themselves from the remarks, NBA legend Magic Johnson called them ridiculous, and the sports media went to town, publishing stories about how Kesslers absence from negotiations improved the prospects of the two sides reaching a new labor deal. (Kessler, it should be noted, wasnt alone: HBO commentator Bryant Gumbel also compared Stern to a plantation master during the 2011 NBA lockout.) Kessler began exploring ways to take on the NCAA late in 2013, when his firm, Winston & Strawn, created a division solely focused on legal issues within college sports . There are good (legal) arguments that Division I football is basically a business, and that students are exploited as workers, he told me in an interview that year . And therefore schools should be free to compensate athletes in any manner that they want to, without NCAA restrictions. At a press conference ahead of Super Bowl XLVIII in February 2014, Kessler met Ramogi Huma, a former linebacker at UCLA who by then had become one of the countrys biggest advocates for expanding the rights of college athletes. Huma was helping football players at Northwestern University in their attempt to form the first players union for college athletes , but he was also dreaming bigger.He wanted to strike at the heart of the NCAAs amateurism model, to destroy the pillar of the system the NCAA has used to defend itself in court. After chatting at the press conference, the pair agreed to meet for lunch near Kesslers office later in the week. Huma was immediately sold.Ive talked to a lot of lawyers who wanted to bring cases, Huma says of Kessler now, and none of them talked like that. Together, Huma and Kessler worked to find a college athlete who could serve as a plaintiff on the suit. Huma had one in mind. He called Martin Jenkins, a defensive back at Clemson University. Jenkins had sensed something wrong with the collegiate model when, not long after he arrived at Clemson, the Tigers compliance staff rattled off the long list of rules about what athletes are and arent allowed to do if they want to maintain their eligibility to play. Red flags started going off in my mind, Jenkins told HuffPost. This wasnt fair to the players, it wasnt fair to the people on the field who were doing the work. Huma asked Jenkins if hed meet with Kessler, and Jenkins agreed. He seemed more excited and energized than I was, and I was really excited to be involved in it, Jenkins said. In March 2014, a month after Kessler and Humas meeting in New York, Kessler sued the NCAA. It has now been more than three years since Kessler sued the NCAA on Jenkins behalf. In the interim, the case has picked up two other named plaintiffs <U+2015> former Middle Tennessee State football player Anfornee Stewart and ex-Wisconsin basketball player Nigel Hayes, who became an outspoken advocate for the rights of college athletes during a career that included two appearances in the Final Four. The big business of college sports, meanwhile, has only continued to explode.Today, the mens NCAA Tournament alone provides the organization with nearly $900 million annually in television revenue, while individual conferences have television contracts worth billions of dollars over their lifespans, and schools pay coaches and athletic directors multimillion-dollar salaries. Collectively, the mens basketball programs that make up Division I and the football programs in the Football Bowl Subdivision generate more than $7 billion in annual revenues. Big-time college sports look more like their professional counterparts than they ever have, with one major exception: The NCAA has restrictive rules in place that prevent schools from compensating athletes beyond the full cost of attending. The economics here are that basketball and football have become gigantic businesses, Kessler said. The total revenue for basketball and football in Division I is greater than the total revenue of the NBA. Its greater than the total revenue of the NHL.  Its the third biggest sport by revenue in this country. The idea that these are not businesses, it makes no sense. And you should allow those who are producing this revenue to be treated in a fairer way. But even though Kessler believes college athletes should be better-compensated,he and his clients arent seeking financial damages. The point of the case isnt to remedy past wrongs, but to completely alter the relationship between players and the system and prevent those wrongs from continuing.Thats what makes the Kessler case different from other antitrust cases filed against the NCAA, including that of former UCLA basketball star Ed OBannon, who won a partial victory for college athletes that allowed them to receive cost-of-attendance stipends beyond the value of a scholarship. During the OBannon suit, NCAA president Mark Emmert suggested that even the largest athletic programs would  move toward a Division III model  of college athletics if they had to pay their athletes (D-III schools dont offer athletic scholarships). Conference and university administrators have suggested that they cant afford to pay athletes, or that doing so would violate the spirit of amateurism in college sports. Kessler has read the headlines and heard these arguments. He knows some believe that his case could  suck the magic out of college sports  and turn them into glorified minor leagues that fans simply wouldnt watch. But even if he wins, he argues, the outcome wont be nearly as dire or drastic as the skeptics predict. Kesslers primary argument is not against the NCAA itself, but its amateurism rules specifically. What violates antitrust law, he argues, is that the schools and major conferences band together under those rules to artificially cap the compensation an athlete can receive for his services to a school. In Kesslers world, conferences could set their own rules regarding compensation, then compete against each other: The Big Ten might stick to the current rules, for instance, while the Southeastern Conference might elect to pay athletes above and beyond the value of a scholarship. Another might follow the Ivy League model and refuse to grant athletic scholarships at all. The result would be something of a free market for mens basketball and football players. Alternatively,the NCAA, its schools and their conferences could follow in the path of major pro leagues, and negotiate a new system with athletes or a body that represents them. I know what theyre going to argue in court, Kessler said, sitting up in his chair and clapping his hands together, his voice nearly cracking from excitement <U+2015> and frustration. Theyll argue what theyve always argued: that amateurism is this holy grail. The new version of it is that if you pay one penny more than the full cost of attendance ... the world will come to an end. There are obvious parallels to his previous cases, where the NBA, Major League Baseball and the NFL all contended that more rights, and more money, for players would spell doom for their products. Free agency, of course, has had none of the dramatic and devastating effects the owners once predicted: Salaries have risen tremendously, sure, but so have revenues. Leagues, owners and players are all vastly richer today than they once were. Its utter and complete nonsense, Kessler said. Allowing baseball, football, basketball and hockey players greater economic freedom and compensation did not destroy the NFL or NBA. It did not destroy the NHL or Major League Baseball. It made those sports fairer and better. It did not decrease popularity or interest in the Olympics. Itll be interesting to see how it plays out, Quinn, Kesslers former partner, said. I think the NCAA has some problems on its hands. Last fall, U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken <U+2015> who also oversaw the OBannon suit, and ruled that the NCAA was in partial violation of antitrust law <U+2015> rejected the NCAAs motion to dismiss the Jenkins case. The two sides have conducted expert depositions and discovery over the last six months, a process that will conclude this month. Theyll return to court for hearings in August, and the case likely will head to trial sometime in 2018. It seems almost impossible that the two sides will reach a settlement before then, given the NCAAs steadfast refusal to bend unless forced. It is likely to take years for the case to reach a final resolution. Kessler is prepared to fight it all the way to the Supreme Court if he has to. But Kessler is confident, and his excitement that a potential trial is drawing nearer is obvious as soon as he begins talking about it. Among those on his side, theres a sense of optimism that Kessler is leading the fight. Theres no question that this is the best possible case that could be brought, Huma said. And a big part of that is because Jeff Kessler is heading it up.

Donald Trump Jr. initially claimed the meeting with Kremlin-linked lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya was simply to discuss an adoption program. But after further reporting, the Times discovered that Trump Jr. had been promised the information about Clinton before arranging the meeting. Trump Jr. then released another statement that differed from his original explanation, offering two versions within a 24-hour period. On Saturday, the Times uncovered the meeting, which took place June 2016. Its the first confirmed meeting between Trumps inner circle and Russian figures during the presidential campaign, amid multiple investigations into whether Trumps campaign colluded with Russia. The meeting was also attended by Trumps then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and son-in-law Jared Kushner, now a senior White House adviser. Prior to the Times reporting that Veselnitskaya had promised damaging information about Clinton,Trump Jr. released a statement to the media on Saturday: It was a short introductory meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up. I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand. Then on Sunday, he admitted to the Times that he was asked to meet with an individual who I was told might have information helpful to the campaign. He clarified on Monday that he knew in advance that the meeting pertained to Clinton. In a Sunday statement to several news organizations, including Reuters, Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Trumps outside legal team handling matters related to the Russia probes, said that the president was not aware of and did not attend the meeting. The Kremlin also denied knowing about the meeting, according to The Associated Press. Kushner has been under investigation after failing to disclose his own meetings with Russian officials during Trumps transition in December, and the Times found this new revelation through a revised version of a form that Kushner filled out to receive a government security clearance. So far, the investigations into whether Trump campaign officials colluded with Russia have focused on more indirect campaign associates, including former advisers Carter Page and Roger Stone, and now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Trumps former national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned in February after misleading administration officials about the extent of his own interactions with Russian officials. It is unknown whether Veselnitskaya, a lawyer who has represented Russian state-owned businesses and the son of senior Russian government official, actually had damaging information about Clinton, the Times reported. Trump Jr. addressed the Veselnitskaya meeting in a new statement Sunday but revealed the real reason he, Kushner and Manafort had attended: to obtain information that would be helpful to the campaign. I was asked to have a meeting by an acquaintance I knew from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant with an individual who I was told might have information helpful to the campaign. I was not told her name prior to the meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to attend, but told them nothing of the substance. We had a meeting in June 2016. After pleasantries were exchanged, the woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton. Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information. She then changed subjects and began discussing the adoption of Russian children and mentioned the Magnitsky Act. It became clear to me that this was the true agenda all along and that the claims of potentially helpful information were a pretext for the meeting. I interrupted and advised her that my father was not an elected official, but rather a private citizen, and that her comments and concerns were better addressed if and when he held public office. The meeting lasted approximately 20 to 30 minutes. As it ended, my acquaintance apologized for taking up our time. That was the end of it and there was no further contact or follow-up of any kind. My father knew nothing of the meeting or these events. On Monday , music publicist Rob Goldstone confirmed to several news outlets that he was the acquaintance who set up the meeting. Goldstones client, singer Emin Agalarov, is the son of a Russian real estate mogul who had planned to partner with Trump to develop a Trump Tower in Moscow . In addition, Agalarov and Trump appeared in a music video for the 2013 Miss Universe pageant , which Trump owned at the time and took place in Russia that year. Later on Monday, the White House defended Trump Jr.Deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed that the elder Trump learned of the meeting in the last couple of days. She also affirmed that Don Jr. did not collude with anybody to influence the election. No one within the Trump campaign colluded, she said, in response to the other Trump campaign officials with links to Russia. Sanders claimed the real problem was the inappropriate leaks of information, a frequent line of attack from the Trump administration. The only thing I see inappropriate about the meeting was the people that leaked the information on the meeting after it was voluntarily disclosed, she said. Read the Times full report here .

75,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ryan-zinke-lisa-murkowski_us_5979f846e4b0da64e8773002","WASHINGTON  With a couple of phone calls to Alaskas Republican delegation, the Trump administration apparently thought it could bully Sen. Lisa Murkowski into supporting her partys attempt to repeal Obamacare . The approach was both rookie and reckless, according to former Interior officials. In the end, the Alaska senator stood her ground , joining two other Republican senators in defeating a skinny repeal of the Affordable Care Act early Friday morning. The issue began when Murkowski voted Tuesday against a measure to begin debate on a health care bill. President Donald Trump used Twitter the next day to voice his dissatisfaction, saying Murkowski  really let the Republicans , and our country, down. On Wednesday night, the Alaska Dispatch News first reported that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke had phoned Murkowski and fellow Alaskan Sen. Dan Sullivan (R) following Tuesdays vote.Zinke delivered atroubling message, indicating that Murkowskis defection could jeopardize future Alaska projects, in particular those involving energy extraction,Sullivan told the paper. In other words, Zinke wanted Murkowski to fall in line <U+2015> or else. But what Zinke and Trump apparently failed to consider before issuing the apparent threat is that government is a two-way street  and Murkowski has a great deal of influence. As chairwoman of both the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies,Murkowski has oversight over the Interior department and its funding. That puts her in a unique position to either advance or obstruct the administrations energy priorities. Alaska is among the nations largest producers of oil and gas, and will likely prove key to the administrations push for energy dominance. If the administration were to follow through on its warning, it would likely involve reversing course on opening additional areas of the state to energy development a move at odds with its own policies. Its like, Dont move, Im going to shoot myself, said Pat Pourchot, who worked as special assistant for Alaskan affairs under two interior secretaries, Sally Jewell and Ken Salazar. Zinke and Murkowski both support increased fossil fuel production in and around Alaska, and appear to have a lot to gain by working collaboratively. The Trump administration is looking to expand offshore drilling and open up currently protected areas of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans to oil and gas development. And Zinke signed a secretarial order May 31 to jump-start oil production in Alaska, including in the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge.During a trip to the state in May, Zinke posted a photo showing him, Murkowski and several others standing alongside the Trans Alaska Pipeline . Last month, the Interior Department also took a first step toward allowing a controversial road to be built through Alaskas Izembek Wildlife Refuge  a project the Obama administration refused to green light and which Murkowski strongly supports. The administration probably could not follow through on its threat without negatively impacting its own interests, said Kate Kelly, who served as the communications director and senior adviser under Interior Secretary Jewell. The Interior Department did not respond to HuffPosts request for comment. Experts also noted that it was bizarre for an Interior secretary <U+2015>whose job it is to manage some 500 million acres of federal land, including 59 national parks <U+2015>to call sitting senators to relay a vague-but-threatening message over a vote on an issue unrelated to the agency. There are so many things that seem to make this a pretty novice move, said Kelly. Murkowski is beholden to no one, so the calculation that she would be swayed by this phone call is an interesting one. Pourchot couldnt recall anything like this happening in his six years at the department. I scratch my head, he told HuffPost. I dont particularly favor our government acting like this  in these raw, retribution-type of scenarios. But also, I dont understand the politics of it for the Trump administration. A third former Interior official echoed Pourchots comments, saying they were not aware of any other Interior secretary calling in such a threat against a member of Congress. There were times that Zinkes predecessors would talk to a legislator in an attempt to calm or improve a situation, the former official said, but never to deliver a threat or antagonize. In an interview with Politico, Alaska Oil & Gas Association President Kara Moriarty called the threats  unfortunate .  As the secretary has said , they want to have American energy dominance, and the only way to do that is through Alaska, Moriarty told the publication. When the time comes when Alaskan energy projects are in front of Congress, I hope they are considered on their merits and not used as a political chits. Murkowski has dismissed the idea that Zinkes phone call was a threat against her or her state.He was just sharing the concern that the president expressed to him to pass on to me, she told the Associated Press, adding that she and Zinke have a cordial, respectful and friendly relationship. On Wednesday, however, Murkowski postponed indefinitely a Thursday hearing to consider several of Trumps nominations to the Interior and Energy departments. She did not offer a reason. And while some speculated it was meant to send a message to the Trump administration, Murkowski told CNN that was not the case and that the delay was to work out a little bump. In a post to Twitter, Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, speculated that Zinkes phone calls would result in an investigation by the inspector general and possibly the Department of Justice. Richard Painter, the former chief White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush,went a step further and called for Zinke to be removed from his post. Interior Department controls vast parts of our Country and cannot be allowed to use federal lands for an extortion racket, Painter wrote on Twitter. Fire Zinke NOW. A spokesperson for the Interior Departments Inspector General Office told Mother Jones it  does not have any plans to investigate the matter , but would assess a complaint if and when it received one. Late Thursday, Rep.Ral M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), the ranking Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, and Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, sent a pair of letters to the Government Accountability Office and the Interiors Inspector General requesting investigations into whether Zinke and other administration officials are advocating for the Republican health care plan. The letters also request a formal determination regarding possible legal violations. Yesterdays phone calls by Secretary Zinke occurred shortly after President Trumps tweet expressing displeasure with Senator Murkowski, and just one day after DOE Secretary Perry generated concerns of impropriety with an editorial weighing in on the health care debate ,Pallone and Grijalva wrote in their letters. The close timing of these actions suggests an apparent pattern and organized effort within the Trump Administration involving the use of federal resources to advance partisan legislation. Grijalva blasted Zinke in a statement earlier Thursday, saying threatening to punish your rivals as political blackmail is something wed see from the Kremlin.",1,40.58,13.1,14.5,1171,53,"If You Come At Sen.

Trump reportedly made the remark during dinner on Friday at the exclusive Florida resort,<e5><ca>where initiation fees cost $200,000, just hours after he signed the bill into law. Asked for comment by CBS News , the White House on Saturday stood by its claims that the legislation would benefit the middle class. While households at every income level will see a tax cut next year , wealthy taxpayers would benefit the most from the bill , according to independent analysts. The heart of the measure is a massive corporate tax cut <U+0089><U+06E5><e5><ca>a permanent reduction in the top rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. Most tax cuts for individuals, however, are set to expire in eight years. The remarks Trump reportedly made on Friday also seemingly contradict a promise he made several months ago when he first began pitching his tax proposal to Congress. <U+0089><db><cf>The rich will not be gaining at all with this plan,<U+0089><U+06DD> Trump said after a Sept. 12 meeting with lawmakers at the White House. <U+0089><db><cf>We are looking for the middle class, and we are looking for jobs, jobs being the economy.

77,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-sexual-harassment-discrimination_us_5a15b385e4b03dec8249b7e5","To the droves of women speaking up about sexual harassment and discrimination, the Trump administration<U+0089><U+06EA>s message is clear: Shut up. Behind the scenes, and mostly through executive orders, the White House is making it harder for women to report sexual harassment and fight sex discrimination. The clearest example came in March. It received little coverage at the time. President Donald Trump reversed an Obama-era order that forbid federal contractors from keeping secret sexual harassment and discrimination cases. The 2014 rule prohibited these companies, which employ about 26 million people, from forcing workers to resolve complaints through arbitration, an increasingly common method businesses use to settle disputes out of the public eye. <U+0089><db><cf>This was a clear sign of the administration silencing women,<U+0089><U+06DD> said Jessica Stender, senior staff attorney for Equal Rights Advocates, a women<U+0089><U+06EA>s rights nonprofit. And it<U+0089><U+06EA>s only a small piece of the picture. <U+0089><db><cf>The Trump administration has a clear anti-women agenda,<U+0089><U+06DD> Stender said. <U+0089><db><cf>I say that with complete certainty. This is an all-out, full frontal attack on women.<U+0089><U+06DD> The attack so far has seen the most success via executive order, but a vast swath of the public policies proposed or endorsed by administration officials attempt to scale back women<U+0089><U+06EA>s rights. From Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s repeal of executive orders meant to reduce pay discrimination to the budget floated in May , the failed repeal of Obamacare , and now the Republican tax bills , actions taken or backed by this administration harm women . This war on women comes at a time when feminist ideals have never seemed more powerful. Finally, sexual assault victims are being heard and believed. Sexual predators like Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein are facing real consequences, losing their jobs, their movie deals, their companies. And, though it<U+0089><U+06EA>s hard to believe now, the U.S. just last year came extremely close to electing its first female president. In this atmosphere, the Trump administration<U+0089><U+06EA>s actions look remarkably like a real-time backlash to the growing assertion of female power. The assault on women began almost instantly after the primal female scream that was the women<U+0089><U+06EA>s march in January. That month, Trump signed his first executive order (surrounded by men). Literally a <U+0089><db><cf> gag rule ,<U+0089><U+06DD> meant to prevent health clinics around the world from even talking about abortion. He was just warming up his pen. After the order on arbitration came in March, the administration in August ditched an innovative equal pay initiative launched by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Currently, women on average make just 80 percent of what men earn. And women of color face even wider pay gaps. The scrapped provision would<U+0089><U+06EA>ve required companies to report data on how much they pay workers <U+0089><U+06E5> broken down by race and ethnicity <U+0089><U+06E5> in order to make it easier to figure out the scope of the pay gap and ideally help close it. The EEOC spent six years devising this rule. The agency worked with the National Academy of Sciences to set-up a study on the pay gap, and revised and tweaked its proposal after consulting with employers and opening it up to public comment. The Office of Management and Budget scrapped the rule with little explanation, beyond saying it would create too much paperwork and impose too much of a burden on corporations. It would<U+0089><U+06EA>ve cost each company $416.58 to comply, according to an EEOC estimate . <U+0089><db><cf>We think it<U+0089><U+06EA>s outrageous,<U+0089><U+06DD> said Robin Thurston, the lead litigator in a lawsuit filed by the National Women<U+0089><U+06EA>s Law Center and the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement that seeks to overturn the decision. The data collection would have had benefits that far outstripped these costs, she said, enabling the EEOC to better enforce civil rights law and find companies with noticeable pay gaps. The agency hasn<U+0089><U+06EA>t yet responded to the suit. Keeping information on pay discrimination out of the public<U+0089><U+06EA>s eye is, of course,<e5><ca> another way to silence women <U+0089><U+06E5> and it<U+0089><U+06EA>s quite effective. Without pay transparency, women and people of color have no way of knowing if they<U+0089><U+06EA>re paid unfairly and the practice can linger. If women do figure out they<U+0089><U+06EA>re underpaid, their complaint could wind up in private arbitration. Colleagues facing similar situations won<U+0089><U+06EA>t know anything. Nothing changes. But the administration wasn<U+0089><U+06EA>t done trying to silence women. In September, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos rescinded a key Obama-era effort meant to help victims of sexual harassment and assault on college campuses: A 2011 letter sent by the administration to colleges defining sexual assault and setting a new standard for how schools should respond to such accusations. Trump, himself accused of sexual misconduct or sexually assaulting at least 13 women , has been largely silent on the recent outpouring of stories of such abuse by well-known and powerful men. One exception: Trump used Twitter to mock Sen. Al Franken after misconduct allegations surfaced against the Minnesota Democrat. On Tuesday, Trump publicly defended Republican Roy Moore, the 70-year-old<e5><ca> Senate candidate in Alabama who has been accused of preying on underage girls as a younger man. <U+0089><db><cf>He says it didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t happen. You have to listen to him also,<U+0089><U+06DD> the president told reporters. Of course, part of his reticence to acknowledge the veracity of these women<U+0089><U+06EA>s claims may be that it would undercut Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s repeated insistence that all the women who accuse him of sexual predation are simply liars. Also on Tuesday, Trump was asked for his message to women during this <U+0089><db><cf>pivotal moment.<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><cf>Women are very special,<U+0089><U+06DD> he said . <U+0089><db><cf>I think it<U+0089><U+06EA>s a very special time because a lot of things are coming out, and I think that<U+0089><U+06EA>s good for our society and I think it<U+0089><U+06EA>s very, very good for women, and I<U+0089><U+06EA>m very happy a lot of these things are coming out.

Paul Ryan intends to remain speaker. <U+0089><db><cf>There<U+0089><U+06EA>s a whole lot of rumors and speculation that the speaker may step aside,<U+0089><U+06DD> one GOP member told HuffPost this week, a sentiment that was expressed by a number of Republicans who, perhaps tellingly, wouldn<U+0089><U+06EA>t go on the record to speak about Ryan<U+0089><U+06EA>s future. The Wisconsin Republican has made no indication he<U+0089><U+06EA>s quitting any time soon, but the possibility that Ryan finishes the tax bill and decides he no longer wants to continue in Congress has begun to loom over internal Republican conversations. When the House Freedom Caucus gathered Monday night, members spent part of their meeting discussing a theory circulating on Capitol Hill and among the downtown Christmas parties that Ryan may believe he<U+0089><U+06EA>s harpooned his personal white whale of tax reform and decide he<U+0089><U+06EA>s finished. <U+0089><db><cf>Is it a Boehner-meeting-the-pope moment?<U+0089><U+06DD> one Freedom Caucus member rhetorically asked HuffPost, referring to Ryan<U+0089><U+06EA>s predecessor, John Boehner (R-Ohio), who hosted Pope Francis for a joint address to Congress in September 2015 and then announced his retirement the next morning. Ryan refused to run for the speakership twice after Boehner announced his resignation, once just after Boehner<U+0089><U+06EA>s decision and then again after Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) abruptly changed his mind and stepped out of the speaker<U+0089><U+06EA>s race. Eventually, Ryan accepted the position, reluctantly, with some conditions. But lawmakers and aides who spoke to HuffPost on the condition of anonymity over the last week say they believe this is still a job Ryan doesn<U+0089><U+06EA>t enjoy. On top of ruling over a GOP conference that<U+0089><U+06EA>s just as unruly as when Boehner was speaker, Ryan has had to navigate Donald Trump <U+0089><U+06E5> a task that<U+0089><U+06EA>s left him looking feckless to the left and like an enemy of the president to the right. The speculation over Ryan<U+0089><U+06EA>s next move has particularly intensified as Republicans negotiate spending deals with Democrats. Ryan has repeatedly pushed off the possibility that a legislative solution for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigration program will be attached to a government spending agreement, but conservatives are worried Republicans could finish their tax bill, have the speaker announce his retirement and then watch Ryan do the same kind of <U+0089><db><cf> barn cleaning <U+0089><U+06DD> that Boehner did at the end of his speakership. The last deal to raise spending caps for two years, in fact, was set under Boehner. Republicans and Democrats are reportedly close to a deal now to once again raise those spending limits for another two years, but conservatives are becoming increasingly certain this isn<U+0089><U+06EA>t a bill they<U+0089><U+06EA>ll support. Ryan<U+0089><U+06EA>s leaving could pave the way for Republicans to swallow a January spending deal with mostly Democratic votes, perhaps raise the debt ceiling again <U+0089><U+06E5> another thing Boehner did as he headed for the exit <U+0089><U+06E5> and potentially find a DACA fix. It<U+0089><U+06EA>s unclear whether Ryan has any further political aspirations beyond this job, but some Republicans think Ryan would be served well by offering himself as a sacrifice for the completion of an immigration deal, particularly if Ryan<U+0089><U+06EA>s political aspirations are far off in the future. (Or if he doesn<U+0089><U+06EA>t have any future political aspirations.) On the other side of the argument, Ryan<U+0089><U+06EA>s stepping down now could hurt Republicans. Ryan<U+0089><U+06EA>s fundraising prowess has helped GOP campaign accounts stay flush with cash in an upcoming election cycle that could be tough for Republicans. And Ryan doesn<U+0089><U+06EA>t seem to have any direct threat to his speakership. Nobody, not even the Freedom Caucus, is really discussing a motion to remove the speaker at this moment. Ryan is also headed for a moment of coronation among GOP members with the passage of this tax bill. That could be the shot in the arm. But that celebration will be short-lived if, as expected, upcoming spending deals put Republicans in the position of significantly raising non-defense spending and shoring up Obamacare. Part of the problem for Ryan is simply that the expectations of the speakership have become unrealistic. The GOP conference has diffuse interests, and prioritizing those interests <U+0089><U+06E5> whether they be of defense hawks, fiscal hawks, moderates or just the Republicans who don<U+0089><U+06EA>t shut down government <U+0089><U+06E5> will naturally create enemies. Ryan isn<U+0089><U+06EA>t without blame, of course. He managed to offend all sides with his on-again-off-again relationship with Trump, and he<U+0089><U+06EA>s been less than honest about how he<U+0089><U+06EA>s ruled over the House. The 10-term congressman came into the speakership promising a more open legislative process. Two years into the job, however, Ryan has taken the restrictions on what amendments will be allowed on the floor to new heights. There wasn<U+0089><U+06EA>t a single <U+0089><db><cf>open<U+0089><U+06DD> rule this year where lawmakers could offer any relevant amendment to a bill under consideration. And the legislative accomplishments Ryan touts <U+0089><U+06E5> whether it be the number of bills passed or that Republicans passed all 12 appropriations bills <U+0089><U+06E5> are grossly overstated. (The House has passed far more post office naming bills than in recent years, and the <U+0089><db><cf>12 appropriations bills<U+0089><U+06DD> were in the form of a couple of packages, written to spending numbers that weren<U+0089><U+06EA>t real, with a confined amendment process.) Still, when HuffPost asked Ryan<U+0089><U+06EA>s spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, whether the speaker believed he had lived up to his promises of an open process, she said he had. Strong also said Ryan was committed to finishing this term in Congress and that he had no intention of retiring in the middle of a session. Asked what else Ryan wanted to accomplish as speaker, Strong mentioned an infrastructure package and said <U+0089><db><cf>welfare reform<U+0089><U+06DD> remained an <U+0089><db><cf>important unfinished item<U+0089><U+06DD> from the GOP<U+0089><U+06EA>s Better Way agenda. That may sound definitive and convincing, but then again so did the quotes coming from Boehner<U+0089><U+06EA>s staff the day before he announced his resignation. When Time asked Boehner<U+0089><U+06EA>s communications director, Kevin Smith, whether he was considering retirement, Boehner<U+0089><U+06EA>s long-time aide was emphatic. <U+0089><db><cf>He<U+0089><U+06EA>s not going anywhere,<U+0089><U+06DD> Smith said in a story that posted the morning Boehner announced his resignation. <U+0089><db><cf>If there<U+0089><U+06EA>s a small crew of members who think that he<U+0089><U+06EA>s just going to pick up and resign in the middle of his term, they are going to be sadly mistaken.<U+0089><U+06DD>",1,46.3,13,13.7,1041,42,"When Will Paul Ryan Step Down?",2017-12-13 20:51:00,"Matt Fuller","Politics","@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_gad,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_politics,congress,john-boehner,paul-ryan,political-science,republican-politics,speaker-of-the-house,type: news,us-house-of-representatives,us-news",489110,428104,489110,337407,49103,250367,1.034,1.092,1.058,1.131,210194,232299,46617,64912,218931,27130,71175,48075,18773,29164,NA,4,19625,17414,2163,28,20,"When Will Paul Ryan Step Down?",2017-12-13 20:51:00,"Matt Fuller","Politics","@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_gad,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_politics,congress,john-boehner,paul-ryan,political-science,republican-politics,speaker-of-the-house,type: news,us-house-of-representatives,us-news",489110,428104,489110,337407,49103,250367,1.034,1.092,1.058,1.131,210194,232299,46617,64912,218931,27130,71175,48075,18773,29164,NA,4,19625,17414,2163,28,20

Republican Roy Moore faced serious accusations of sexual misconduct in his bid to become Alabama<U+0089><U+06EA>s next senator. But instead of bowing down and backing out, he stayed in the race and went on the attack <U+0089><U+06E5> just like Trump did in last year<U+0089><U+06EA>s presidential race. He accused the media and the establishment of orchestrating a conspiracy against him, and cast the race as pitting good against evil, Christians versus everyone else. Both Trump and Moore bet that their conservative base would stick by them and push them to victory. But on Tuesday, Alabama sent a message that this time it wouldn<U+0089><U+06EA>t work, not even in a conservative state that Trump won by 28 percentage points in 2016. Voters instead elected Doug Jones, making him the first Democrat to win a U.S. Senate seat in the state in 25 years. The Associated Press called the race for Jones 2<e5>_ hours after polls closed in the state. <U+0089><db><cf>We have shown the country the way that we can be unified,<U+0089><U+06DD> an ecstatic Jones said in his victory speech Tuesday night. When Jeff Sessions stepped down as senator nine months ago to become Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s attorney general, it was considered a sure bet that the seat would remain in GOP control. But then Moore came along, defeating the establishment choice in the Republican primary and giving Democrats a glimmer of hope that they could win <U+0089><U+06E5> or at least do better than they thought possible in Alabama. Some Moore supporters were in disbelief Tuesday night. Willie Casey, 70, a Republican from Birmingham who was standing outside the Moore watch party, said there <U+0089><db><cf>has to be a recount.<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><cf>It was tight. I<U+0089><U+06EA>m disappointed,<U+0089><U+06DD> he told HuffPost. <U+0089><db><cf>I think [Sen. Richard] Shelby coming out against him made a huge difference, but I also think the whole thing is suspicious.<U+0089><U+06DD> Moore himself refused to concede as well. Speaking to supporters at his election night party, Moore suggested the possibility of demanding a recount, saying, <U+0089><db><cf>God is still in control.<U+0089><U+06DD> The controversial Moore, 70, had long been known for his conservative religious beliefs , opposing equal rights for Muslims and the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community. And though he won statewide races for chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, his vote counts underperformed compared with other Republicans on the ballot. Then in November,<e5><ca>The Washington Post published an article in which four women accused Moore of pursuing them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. One of them said she was 14 when he sexually assaulted her. After that story came out, more women came forward with similar stories about Moore. Even after the bombshell allegations, Democrats were skeptical Jones, 63, could win. It was still Alabama, a state that Republicans dominate. But the Jones campaign set about focusing on three goals : 1) expand the Democratic electorate, especially by getting more African-American voters to turn out; 2) persuade some Republicans disgusted by Moore to vote for Jones; 3) hope other Republicans would simply stay home. National Democrats tried to help out by staying quiet. Associating with the party wouldn<U+0089><U+06EA>t help Jones, who was trying to emphasize that he would work across the aisle and not be beholden to people like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). Democrats also got lucky with Jones, who had a strong biography (he was a U.S. attorney who prosecuted Ku Klux Klan members for a 1963 church bombing that killed four African-American girls) and made few major missteps during the campaign. While Republicans are no doubt unhappy to lose a Senate seat, there are also some sighs of relief. There<U+0089><U+06EA>s a solid case to be made that they<U+0089><U+06EA>ll be able to win it back during the regular election in 2020, if they have a more traditional candidate. And now, they won<U+0089><U+06EA>t have to constantly be on the defensive about being a party that harbors an accused child molester. They will still, however, have to contend with being the party that has a man accused of sexual misconduct by 19 women sitting in the White House. Moore supporters immediately began blaming the GOP establishment. Shelby, publicly condemned Moore and refused to vote for him, has earned the ire of many conservatives in the state recently.

Desiree Fairooz , 61, who was associated with the group Code Pink, had been convicted of disorderly and disruptive conduct and demonstrating inside the Capitol.<e5><ca>Fairooz was taken into custody during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in January after she laughed when Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) claimed Sessions had a <U+0089><db><cf>clear and well-documented<U+0089><U+06DD> record of <U+0089><db><cf>treating all Americans equally under the law.<U+0089><U+06DD> (The Senate rejected Sessions<U+0089><U+06EA> nomination for a federal judgeship in the 1980s over concerns about his views on race.) But Chief Judge Robert E. Morin of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia tossed out the guilty verdict on Friday because the government had argued that the laugh alone was enough to warrant the verdict. Morin said it was <U+0089><db><cf>disconcerting<U+0089><U+06DD> that the government made the case in closing arguments that the laughter in and of itself was sufficient. <U+0089><db><cf>The court is concerned about the government<U+0089><U+06EA>s theory,<U+0089><U+06DD> Morin said. He said the laughter <U+0089><db><cf>would not be sufficient<U+0089><U+06DD> to submit the case to the jury, and said the government hadn<U+0089><U+06EA>t made clear before the trial that it intended to make that argument. The rookie officer who seized Fairooz had never made an arrest and had no experience securing congressional hearings. Nevertheless, prosecutors pressed forward, insisting that <U+0089><db><cf> laughter is enough <U+0089><U+06DD> to merit criminal charges of disorderly and disruptive conduct and demonstrating inside the Capitol. She was convicted in May. Fairooz<U+0089><U+06EA>s attorney had argued that she had the right to object to her arrest as she was being taken out of the room, and that a conviction based upon her conduct after the initial laugh could not stand.<e5><ca>Attorney Sam Bogash asked the judge to toss out the jury verdict .<e5><ca>The jury, Bogash wrote,<e5><U+0289><db><cf>was not reasonable<U+0089><U+06DD> in its evaluation of the evidence. <U+0089><db><cf>Ms. Fairooz<U+0089><U+06EA>s brief reflexive burst of noise, be it laughter or an audible gasp, clearly cannot sustain a conviction for either of the counts in the information,<U+0089><U+06DD> Bogash wrote in a court filing. <U+0089><db><cf>So the only other basis for her conviction to anything are her statements after the U.S. Capitol Police arrested her for that laughing. Those statements merely expressed surprise at being arrested.<U+0089><U+06DD> While some of Fairooz<U+0089><U+06EA>s statements as she was being arrested <U+0089><U+06E5> like <U+0089><db><cf>Why am I being taken out of here?<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><U+06E5> objected to her treatment, others, like <U+0089><db><cf>This man is evil, pure evil,<U+0089><U+06DD> were more political in nature, and perhaps more likely to support a conviction. Kimberly Paschall, an attorney for the government, argued during a court hearing on Friday that <U+0089><db><cf>Ms. Fairooz was not merely responding<U+0089><U+06DD> to her arrest.<e5><U+0289><db><cf>She wasn<U+0089><U+06EA>t just merely responding, she was voicing an opinion,<U+0089><U+06DD> Paschall said. The government argued that the jury<U+0089><U+06EA>s guilty verdict should be upheld . Paschall had argued in court filings that the government had <U+0089><db><cf>presented evidence that the defendant engaged in disorderly or disruptive conduct when she loudly laughed at Senator Shelby<U+0089><U+06EA>s comments.<U+0089><U+06DD> Jurors<e5><U+0289><db><cf>could reasonably infer that the laugh was a deliberate disruption<U+0089><U+06DD> and <U+0089><db><cf>intentional,<U+0089><U+06DD> Paschall wrote. The government also focused on Fairooz<U+0089><U+06EA>s conduct after the officer tried to take her into custody. <U+0089><db><cf>She did not merely laugh,<U+0089><U+06DD><e5><ca>Paschall wrote.<e5><U+0289><db><cf>Just as a defendant cannot resist arrest when the arrest is unlawful, a defendant should not be able to disrupt a hearing before Congress based on her opinion that police action was unlawful.<U+0089><U+06DD> When Judge Morin said in court on Friday no one could know the basis of the jury<U+0089><U+06EA>s conviction, Paschall tried to bring up interviews that HuffPost had conducted with the jurors after the meeting, in which they said they were focused on her actions after the laughter.<e5><U+0289><db><cf>She did not get convicted for laughing. It was her actions as she was being asked to leave,<U+0089><U+06DD> the jury foreperson told HuffPost at the time . Judge Morin said those interviews were irrelevant. <U+0089><db><cf>Counsel, you know that<U+0089><U+06EA>s not admissible,<U+0089><U+06DD> Morin told Paschall. He then ordered a new trial.

A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney<U+0089><U+06EA>s Office for the District of Columbia declined to comment on whether the government planned to retry the case. <U+0089><db><cf>For a little giggle in the Sessions hearing, it<U+0089><U+06EA>s outrageous,<U+0089><U+06DD> Fairooz told HuffPost. <U+0089><db><cf>I think they<U+0089><U+06EA>re harassing me, it<U+0089><U+06EA>s awful.<U+0089><U+06DD> Fairooz said she had been hoping that the judge wouldn<U+0089><U+06EA>t give the government another chance to bring it to trial. <U+0089><db><cf>Why it got to this point, I don<U+0089><U+06EA>t understand,<U+0089><U+06DD> she said. News of Fairooz<U+0089><U+06EA>s prosecution went viral after it was first reported by HuffPost. The international news coverage sparked jokes by late-night comedians , including Stephen Colbert, and attracted the attention of Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee. In a letter to the judge, Conyers wrote that<e5><U+0289><db><cf>substantial questions exist with respect to the application of law<U+0089><U+06DD> in Fairooz<U+0089><U+06EA>s case, and asked for leniency. <U+0089><db><cf>As the Ranking Member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, I take seriously breaches of decorum in Congress,<U+0089><U+06DD> Conyers wrote. <U+0089><db><cf>However, in this instance, the finding of guilt under these particular circumstances raises questions that should counsel leniency with regard to sentencing.<U+0089><U+06DD> Tighe Barry and Lenny Bianchi, two protesters tried alongside Fairooz for their actions at the hearing while dressed up as members of the KKK , were sentenced on Friday to 10 days suspension, meaning they likely won<U+0089><U+06EA>t serve any jail time unless they violate the conditions of their six-month unsupervised probation. Restrictions were placed on their access to Capitol Hill. A spokeswoman for Sessions declined to comment late Friday on whether the attorney general would like his prosecutors to once again bring the case before a jury.

The president<U+0089><U+06EA>s family business is worth about one-tenth of the value he has claimed, according to an analysis of the latest figures he has filed with the federal government. Some of the discrepancy is due to a downturn in business, but the rest is credited to an overheated imagination, according to Crain<U+0089><U+06EA>s New York Business reporter Aaron Elstein, who examined the numbers. Elstein told NPR he feels a bit like he was played . In 2016 the Trump Organization reported nearly $9.5 billion in sales. But recent public filings by the president indicate that the company<U+0089><U+06EA>s actual revenue that year was only as much as $700 million, Crain<U+0089><U+06EA>s said. Crain<U+0089><U+06EA>s determined Trump has been reporting inflated revenue since at least 2010. After examining the latest figures Trump has filed, Crain<U+0089><U+06EA>s this month bounced the Trump Organization from the No. 3 spot on its list of largest privately held New York City companies down to No. 40. <U+0089><db><cf>It was obviously very important to Donald to have his company on the top of the list<e5><ca>... but the numbers that he presented are just flagrantly untrue,<U+0089><U+06DD> Elstein told NPR.

But Trump remains a billionaire on the Forbes list, where he clocks in at $3.1 billion in total assets. He also took a dive on Bloomberg<U+0089><U+06EA>s Billionaires index, but is credited with still having a total $2.9 billion in assets, as far as Bloomberg knows.

Growing up in private evangelical Christian schools, Bishop saw the world in extremes, good and evil, heaven and hell. She was taught that to dance was to sin, that gay people were child molesters and that mental illness was a function of satanic influence. Teachers at her schools talked about slavery as black immigration, and instructors called environmentalists <U+0089><db><cf>hippie witches.<U+0089><U+06DD> Bishop<U+0089><U+06EA>s family moved around a lot when she was a child, but her family always enrolled her in evangelical schools. So when Bishop left school in 2003 and entered the real world at 17, she felt like she was an alien landing on Planet Earth for the first time. Having been cut off from mainstream society, she felt unequipped to handle the job market and develop secular friendships. Lacking shared cultural and historical references, she spent most of her 20s holed up in her bedroom, suffering from crippling social anxiety. Now, at 31, she has become everything that she was once taught to hate. She shares an apartment with her girlfriend of two years. She sees a therapist and takes medication for depression, a condition born, in part, of her stifling education. Years later, some of the schools Bishop attended are largely the same, but some have changed in a significant way: Unlike when Bishop was a student, parents are not the only ones paying tuition for these fundamentalist religious schools <U+0089><db><d2> so are taxpayers. These schools are among thousands in the United States that participate in private school choice programs, which most often come in the form of state-level voucher or tax credit scholarships. Voucher programs offer publicly funded financial aid to parents for private schools. Tax credit programs usually offer individuals or corporations tax credits if they donate to a scholarship granting organization, which in turn offers private school scholarships based on various criteria, including income. President Donald Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos have openly championed such programs and have encouraged states to embrace school choice, arguing that voucher programs give parents an alternative to low-performing public schools. Currently 14 states and the District of Columbia have voucher programs, and 17 have tax credit programs. DeVos has made it a top priority to push a federal school choice initiative. Many of the private schools that participate in these state-led programs are run by evangelical Christian churches. They are sometimes unaccredited and can teach a curriculum similar to the one Bishop studied <U+0089><U+06E5> all with the help of taxpayer dollars. The textbooks used at all of Bishop<U+0089><U+06EA>s schools were published by three of the most popular, and most ideologically extreme, Christian textbook companies: Abeka, Bob Jones University Press and Accelerated Christian Education. The ideas in these textbooks often flout widely accepted science and historical fact. But the number of schools using these resources is largely unknown, even in states where they receive support from publicly funded scholarships. No state or federal organization tracks the curriculum being used in private school choice programs. The religious affiliations of schools that participate in these programs are also not always tracked. That means there are thousands of kids receiving an extremist and ultraconservative education at the expense of taxpayers. Several months ago, HuffPost set out to create a database of every private school in the country that receives taxpayer funding. We also tracked the religious affiliation of each school and looked at how many taught from these evangelical Christian textbooks. HuffPost obtained lists of schools that participate in private school choice programs around the country. We searched for the most up-to-date lists on either a state<U+0089><U+06EA>s education or revenue department<U+0089><U+06EA>s website. Several states did not keep a list of which schools participate in choice programs. In those instances, we went directly to the individual scholarship granting organizations in each state. Our list totaled about 7,200 across the 25 of 27 states that offer private school choice along with the District of Columbia. (Two states that do not allow religious schools to participate in private school choice programs were excluded from our analysis.) Then we researched the religious affiliations of each school by scouring each school<U+0089><U+06EA>s website. If a school did not maintain a website, we emailed school representatives and often followed up with a phone call. Our analysis found that about 75 percent of voucher schools across the country are religious <U+0089><U+06E5> usually Christian or Catholic, with about 2 percent identifying as Jewish and 1 percent identifying as Muslim. There were gray areas: At least five schools identified as non-religious but used a curriculum created by the founder of the Church of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard. Since a plurality of schools in these programs (42 percent) are non-Catholic Christian schools, we dove deeply into researching the curriculum of those schools. We searched their websites for information on curriculum sources and sent out emails to school leaders if they did not make their academic plan public. We did not assess Catholic schools, which made up 31 percent of Christian schools, since there is already a large body of research on the outcomes of students who go to these schools. Evangelical Christian schools are newer <U+0089><U+06E5> many popped up only a few decades ago <U+0089><db><d2> and remain less scrutinized. Indeed, we found many of the non-Catholic Christian schools (33 percent) were using Abeka, Bob Jones or ACE textbooks in at least one subject or grade. We found that Abeka was the most popular textbook source <U+0089><U+06E5> used in about 27 percent of non-Catholic Christian schools <U+0089><U+06E5> and Accelerated Christian Education was the least popular <U+0089><U+06E5> used in about 5 percent of these schools. We could not definitively ascertain the curriculum used by about 1,800 Christian schools, because they did not respond to requests for information. Around 200 Christian schools told us they did not use these three textbook sources. With taxpayers footing the bill for religious private schools, the separation of church and state, a cornerstone of American democracy, becomes a murky line. So how did it come to be that taxpayers are footing the bill for an evangelical education? Most states have little oversight on the curriculum used in schools that participate in private school choice programs. Some states have zero regulations on the topic. Others require private schools to follow the state<U+0089><U+06EA>s broad-based content standards but specify little else. (Rhode Island<U+0089><U+06EA>s stipulations appear the most strict: Curricula in private schools must be submitted and largely equivalent to what is taught in public schools.) Additionally, private schools that participate in these programs are not typically subject to the same accountability and transparency rules as public schools, although rules vary on a state-by-state basis. It is difficult to ascertain exactly how many students use taxpayer funds to attend schools with evangelical curricula, but we do know that over 400,000 students nationwide currently attend school using money from a voucher or tax credit program, according to the education reform group EdChoice . Some states are more transparent than others. In Indiana, about 4,240 students received over $16 million in scholarships to attend schools that use the Abeka or Bob Jones curriculum, according to 2016-2017 figures from the Indiana Department of Education. These numbers could soon grow. DeVos is an advocate of school choice and religious education. While she failed in her first attempt to push a federal private school choice program via the Education Department budget, she has repeatedly said she will not stop trying. The prospect of giving kids more access to these schools with public money is deeply upsetting to Bishop, who was recently diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of bullying and corporal punishment she experienced as a child. After leaving high school and getting a taste of the outside world, Bishop fell into a deep depression. When she went to job interviews, she had no idea what to say about the education she had received. What They Learned HuffPost spoke to nearly a dozen former students and teachers at schools that relied on Abeka, Bob Jones and Accelerated Christian Education curricula. Many of these students, who consider themselves no longer religious, reported feeling traumatized by their educational experiences. A number of them communicate with each other via online support groups for survivors of fundamentalist schools, including Bishop. Some say these curriculum sources left them woefully ill-equipped to thrive in a diverse society while instilling in them racist, sexist and intolerant views of the world. Bishop said her fundamentalist education made her wary of people from other religious groups whom her teachers and textbooks had demonized. <U+0089><db><cf>Anything that wasn<U+0089><U+06EA>t Christianity was a strange religion,<U+0089><U+06DD> said Bishop, who made it a priority to study other religious practices after high school and even spent time with the Hare Krishna. <U+0089><db><cf>But even other denominations were evil. Catholicism especially.<U+0089><U+06DD> Another former student who spoke to HuffPost under the pseudonym Natasha Balzak, was taught at home that all Muslims hate America, she said. Teachers at her Florida school reinforced this idea, telling students to pray for Muslims and other non-believers, like atheists and gay people. <U+0089><db><cf>When it comes to hateful ideology and rhetoric, I was taught a lot of things to skew my mind into believing <U+0089><U+06E5> I guess you could call it brainwashing,<U+0089><U+06DD> said Balzak, 27, who is using a pseudonym to protect the identity of family members who are still deeply involved in their church. Balzak recalled that her school, Coral Springs Christian Academy, used a mix of ACE and Abeka materials, but the head of the school said they were not aware of the school ever using ACE and that they currently used only Abeka in lower grades for phonics. The school participates in Florida<U+0089><U+06EA>s three private-school choice programs and currently enrolls 172 students on these scholarships. It received $554,418 in taxpayer-funded scholarships this year, according to a spokesperson for the Florida Department of Education. A HuffPost analysis of Abeka, Bob Jones and ACE textbooks confirms the recollections of these students. These materials inaccurately portray events in Muslim and Catholic history while perpetuating anti-Semitic stereotypes. The materials speak disparagingly of Native Americans and Native culture. The chart below details some of the inaccurate and biased perspectives in these textbooks compared with the perspective of an academic who studies these issues. A Bob Jones high school world history textbook portrays Islam as a violent religion and contains a title <U+0089><db><cf>Islam and Murder.<U+0089><U+06DD> In the same textbook, when describing the Catholic Reformation, Catholic leaders are described as failing <U+0089><db><cf>to see that the root of their problems was doctrinal error.<U+0089><U+06DD> When describing the concept of Manifest Destiny, the term used to describe America<U+0089><U+06EA>s 19th century expansion westward, an ACE textbook referred to the movement essentially as spreading the gospel: <U+0089><db><cf>It was considered God<U+0089><U+06EA>s will that this vastly superior American culture should spread to all corners of the North American continent,<U+0089><U+06DD> the passage reads. <U+0089><db><cf>The benighted Indians would be among the many beneficiaries of God<U+0089><U+06EA>s provision.<U+0089><U+06DD> David Brockman, an expert on world religions, was presented with passages from the Bob Jones and ACE textbooks. Most Protestants would likely disagree with the theological and historical narratives portrayed in the books, he said. <U+0089><db><cf>The textbook simply distorts history,<U+0089><U+06DD> wrote Brockman, a non-resident scholar at Rice University<U+0089><U+06EA>s Baker Institute for Public Policy, after examining the selections. <U+0089><db><cf>And given the biblical command not to bear false witness, I would question whether a distorted history is consistent with Christian teaching.<U+0089><U+06DD> When Balzak attended a secular college in 2009, it was a shock to the system, she said. In her first environmental science class, she learned about climate change <U+0089><U+06E5> a concept she had been taught was a hoax. <U+0089><db><cf>When I took my first real science class, a million light bulbs went off,<U+0089><U+06DD> said Balzak, who had only been taught creationism in school. <U+0089><db><cf>Everything finally made sense.<U+0089><U+06DD> The experience made Balzak feel robbed of a fact-based education. Indeed, Balzak<U+0089><U+06EA>s former school, Coral Springs Christian Academy, includes a statement of faith in its parent-student handbook, which is posted on its website: <U+0089><db><cf>We believe God created the entire universe out of nothing.<U+0089><U+06DD> The handbook also describes the school<U+0089><U+06EA>s attitude toward LGBTQ students. It says administrators will reject applicants or expel current students if they are caught <U+0089><db><cf>living in, or condoning, or supporting any form of sexual immorality; practicing or promoting a homosexual lifestyle or alternative gender identity.<U+0089><U+06DD> Coral Springs<U+0089><U+06EA> head of school noted that the institution had likely changed a lot since Balzak attended some years ago, although he has worked at the school for only a few years. He said that staff members do not recall the school ever relying significantly on Abeka materials, and says that the student body has become significantly more diverse, <U+0089><db><cf>It<U+0089><U+06EA>s a very different education I<U+0089><U+06EA>m sure than 20 years ago,<U+0089><U+06DD> said head of school Joseph Sanelli. But in some ways, Balzak considered herself lucky. She said her childhood wasn<U+0089><U+06EA>t traumatic, just deeply imperfect. Bishop didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t have such luck. Some of the schools Bishop attended were worse than others. She faced the greatest difficulty from ages 11 to 13, when she attended Franklin Christian Academy in Georgia. The school appears to no longer be open, according to the Georgia Department of Education list of private schools, and a series of calls to what Bishop said was an affiliated church were not returned. The school consisted of three rooms, Bishop recalled, with most of the school<U+0089><U+06EA>s 30-something kids spending all day in the same classroom. The school relied on an Accelerated Christian Education curriculum currently used by at least nine private schools in Georgia that are eligible for taxpayer funds. ACE classrooms are uniquely designed. Students sit in cubicle-like offices, with barriers separating their desks. Teachers do not lead students in lessons or discussions. Instead, students spend all day silently sifting through a succession of readings and fill-in-the-blank worksheets. When students have a question, they raise either an American or Christian flag to get the attention of a class supervisor. A 2012 training manual for administrators obtained by HuffPost lists an education degree as a <U+0089><db><cf>detriment<U+0089><U+06DD> for the job. Indeed these supervisors<U+0089><U+06EA> lack of qualifications was once the topic of a <U+0089><db><cf>Judge Judy<U+0089><U+06DD> episode about a decade ago. At Bishop<U+0089><U+06EA>s school, she dealt with intense physical bullying and verbal harassment. When she would complain about the harassment, school authorities told her to ignore it. They sometimes implied she was at fault and needed to get closer to Jesus, she said. The school did not employ professionals trained to deal with mental health issues, she added. As a teenager she went nearly mute and thought about killing herself. <U+0089><db><cf>I didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t want to get out of bed. I did self-harm,<U+0089><U+06DD> she said, speaking slowly and deliberately over coffee. <U+0089><db><cf>I just hated myself and I didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t know what to do about it.<U+0089><U+06DD> It was also around that time that Bishop realized she was attracted to other girls. She repressed her feelings for decades, even spending most of her 20s married to a man. An examination of ACE textbooks shows that its materials push strict ideas about gender roles and sexuality. Even now Bishop still sometimes finds herself shrinking in the presence of men, saying that it<U+0089><U+06EA>s almost like <U+0089><db><cf>muscle memory.<U+0089><U+06DD> Balzak echoes these sentiments, saying that even her female teachers reinforced the idea that women are secondary to men. When describing the 1920s, a high school ACE textbook criticizes women for wearing short skirts and cutting their hair, calling it a violation of Scripture. Before the 1920s, when women were less likely to work outside the home, they <U+0089><db><cf>were comfortable to be discreet, chaste, keepers at house, good, obedient to their own husbands,<U+0089><U+06DD> says the material. School, Bishop said, made her want to give up on education. She spent some time being home-schooled, then at another Georgia school before moving to Roxboro Christian School in North Carolina. After less than two years there <U+0089><U+06E5> in which she spent much of her time hiding in the bathroom <U+0089><U+06E5> she dropped out and got her GED. Roxboro currently participates in North Carolina<U+0089><U+06EA>s voucher program, and representatives there confirmed that Bishop was once enrolled. The school also confirmed that they use Abeka, Bob Jones and ACE. Roxboro has received over $8,000 this year in voucher program and currently enrolls four scholarship recipients, per a report from the North Carolina State Education Assistance Authority. Two other schools Bishop attended are also eligible to receive monetary assistance via school voucher or tax credit programs. Bishop attended Beaufort Christian School in South Carolina and Neuse Christian Academy in North Carolina as a child. Beaufort Christian Academy uses materials from Abeka and ACE, per its website. A representative from the school confirmed that Bishop was once enrolled. Neuse Christian Academy uses materials from Abeka and Bob Jones University, and it received $37,368 in scholarship money for 18 students, per the North Carolina Education Assistance Authority. The school was not able to confirm Bishop<U+0089><U+06EA>s enrollment because it does not still have its records from that time. How Did These Textbooks Come To Be? Abeka, Bob Jones University Press and Accelerated Christian Education started selling textbooks in the early 1970s, a few decades before Wisconsin enacted the nation<U+0089><U+06EA>s first voucher program. At the time, enrollment in fundamentalist Christian schools was booming. For one, recent Supreme Court decisions had banned school Bible readings and official school prayer. Groups of evangelical Protestants were alarmed. The founders of these textbook companies dedicated their lives to pushing fundamentalist viewpoints. Abeka leaders Arlin and Beka Horton also founded Pensacola Christian College in Florida, which outlaws dancing and other <U+0089><db><cf>satanic practices.<U+0089><U+06DD> They also founded Pensacola Christian Academy, a K-12 school that currently receives public funding for student scholarships via Florida<U+0089><U+06EA>s tax credit program. Bob Jones University Press is affiliated with Bob Jones University, which famously lost its tax-exempt status in 1983 after banning interracial dating, a policy it didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t reverse until 2000. Accelerated Christian Education was founded by Donald Howard, a Texas pastor. In his 1988 book, <U+0089><db><cf>World Awakening,<U+0089><U+06DD> Howard describes AIDS as a plague sent down by God intended to punish gay people and other idol worshippers, like <U+0089><db><cf>feminists, prochoice, and Planned Parenthood advocates.<U+0089><U+06DD> ACE, Abeka and Bob Jones University Press leaders have largely similar educational philosophies, with a few subtle differences. The leaders of all three companies subscribe to an authoritarian vision of education in which students are taught not to question their elders. While ACE<U+0089><U+06EA>s curriculum barely involves a teacher, Abeka<U+0089><U+06EA>s promotes the educator as an absolute authority, per research from Binghamton University professor Adam Laats. They all have come under fire for providing children with an inadequate education. Eleven separate reviews of the ACE program by experts and academics have repudiated the curriculum, according to research conducted by Jonny Scaramanga at University College London. A representative of ACE responded to one of these reviews from 1987. <U+0089><db><cf>Our material is not written with conventional viewpoints in mind. We do not believe that education should be nondirective or speculative, or that the final interpretation of facts and events should be left up to immature inexperienced minds as mainline secular curricula do,<U+0089><U+06DD> wrote a former ACE vice president at the time. The University of California system refuses to accept certain high school courses that rely on BJU and Abeka materials for credit. The Association of Christian Schools International sued the University of California System over this issue in 2005. A judge eventually ruled in favor of the UC System. Still, American taxpayers continue to indirectly prop up these curricula through voucher programs. It is unclear how the proliferation of private school choice programs has affected the bottom line for these textbook companies. Representatives of Bob Jones University Press did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Representatives of ACE did not respond to requests for comment either, however its website claims they are in 6,000 schools around the globe, although a number of experts told HuffPost that they are skeptical of this number. A spokesperson for Abeka noted that, while the company is aware its materials are used in private schools that receive public funding, <U+0089><db><cf>Abeka does not advocate or encourage the use of state or federal funding for private, Christian schools.<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><cf>We recognize that academic scholars have differing opinions on historical/scientific content and that this frequently occurs in both public and private educational institutions as reported in the media. We are confident that our content is accurate, age appropriate, and academically rigorous,<U+0089><U+06DD> wrote Brent Phillips, assistant to the president for business affairs, via email. Educators Sound Off Educators who use or are familiar with these resources told HuffPost that not all schools who use them have a fundamentalist approach. Indeed, not all schools who use these curricula are deeply religious, and they are used in a range of Christian schools. <e5><ca>They emphasize that the quality of these publishers<U+0089><U+06EA> resources differ based on subject and grade level. Bishop said that, while her <U+0089><db><cf>education did not equip me to get the most basic of jobs,<U+0089><U+06DD> she praised the rigor of Abeka and Bob Jones vocabulary and reading comprehension lessons. (Below, a passage on slavery from an Accelerated Christian Education textbook) Dave Moore, executive director of Pittsburgh Urban Christian School in Pennsylvania, said that he does not use any materials provided by these sources but that <U+0089><db><cf>Abeka has excellent elementary grammar resources.<U+0089><U+06DD> Pittsburgh Urban Christian receives scholarship money through Pennsylvania<U+0089><U+06EA>s school tax credit program. <U+0089><db><cf>I would still use it if we didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t already develop our own curriculum. It does such a good job of it,<U+0089><U+06DD> said Moore of Abeka<U+0089><U+06EA>s elementary phonics and math resources. If his school decided to use Abeka materials, he would direct teachers to be on alert for propaganda, he said. <U+0089><db><cf>We do the same thing with secular textbooks,<U+0089><U+06DD> Moore said. Some educators told HuffPost they are happy with the education students receive with these resources. Stephen Lindahl, assistant director of Calumet Christian School in Griffith, Indiana, disagreed with characterizations of Abeka and Bob Jones University Press as pushing a far-right worldview. His school uses Abeka materials almost exclusively for elementary school and then a mix of Abeka and Bob Jones in some later grades. <U+0089><db><cf>Abeka and Bob Jones and other biblically based curriculum try to approach academics from a biblical standpoint and from a moral, ethical view, which does not necessarily push any agenda outside of an understanding of God and who Christ is,<U+0089><U+06DD> Lindahl said. He noted that secular textbooks, too, often come with a specific point of view. HuffPost also reached out to multiple national school-choice advocacy groups for their responses on our findings. None of them responded, even sometimes with weeks<U+0089><U+06EA> notice. However, professors who have studied the curricula say they are dangerous tools for schools to wield. <U+0089><db><cf>I want parents to know their children might be coming home with a book that looks like an ordinary textbook but the messages are not what people would ordinarily learn,<U+0089><U+06DD> said Kathleen Wellman, a professor of history at Southern Methodist University who is working on a book about these publications. <U+0089><db><cf>Many universities don<U+0089><U+06EA>t require history education, so for many Americans this will be their last exposure to history. And many students say they didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t realize at the time how thoroughly indoctrinated they were being.<U+0089><U+06DD> Sometimes Bishop wonders what her life would have been like had she not attended evangelical schools. She tried taking online university courses once but dropped out after having trouble balancing academics with her job. She still thinks about trying college again from time to time but worries about the financial feasibility. (Below, a passage on evolution from an Accelerated Christian Education textbook) Growing up, her schools had never offered outlets for her interest in art or dance <U+0089><U+06E5> things that she maybe would have wanted to explore. The only thing she ever remembers wanting to do was perform, a far cry from her current job, working in the produce department of a grocery store. The only career paths presented to her revolved around the church. <U+0089><db><cf>It would be kind of different if I was at a school that allowed me to head in a direction I wanted to go,<U+0089><U+06DD> said Bishop, who lights up when talking about the dance classes she has taken as an adult. <U+0089><db><cf>I didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t really get that chance.<U+0089><U+06DD> Kaeli Subberwal contributed to this report.

To make its point, Fox pointed to ESPN<U+0089><U+06EA>s firing of analyst and former professional baseball pitcher Curt Schilling in May 2016 over a demeaning anti-transgender Facebook post by him. The post, apparently in response to North Carolina<U+0089><U+06EA>s anti-LGBT bathroom law, included a meme showing a man dressed in revealing women<U+0089><U+06EA>s clothing. With it Schilling commented: <U+0089><db><cf> A man is a man no matter what they call themselves .

Senate Republicans failed to repeal Obamacare <U+0089><U+06E5> again <U+0089><U+06E5> and this time, at least for now, they appear ready to throw in the towel. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) looked stunned as the vote went down, and set up a vote for a judicial nominee next week before gaveling out. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) issued a statement saying he<U+0089><U+06EA>s moving onto what he<U+0089><U+06EA>s wanted to do all along, tax reform. It leaves Trump in his weakest position yet. Six months into the job, he has failed to unify his party to pass their No. 1-priority issue, at a time when the GOP controls all of government. He<U+0089><U+06EA>s proven to be a terrible dealmaker. He<U+0089><U+06EA>s demonstrated that his grand promises to his base about repealing President Barack Obama<U+0089><U+06EA>s signature law were empty, and that he<U+0089><U+06EA>s more interested in showmanship than substance. The photo below from a May ceremony in the Rose Garden, when Trump took a premature victory lap with House Republicans after they passed their (now dead) bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, is already starting to feel like his very own <U+0089><db><cf>Mission Accomplished<U+0089><U+06DD> moment. As lawmakers prepare to head home for the month of August,<e5><ca>the president still doesn<U+0089><U+06EA>t have a single major legislative accomplishment under his belt. His popularity is stuck at historic lows . And while it may seem far away, the 2018 elections are on lawmakers<U+0089><U+06EA> minds and will increasingly drive how they vote, regardless of what Trump wants.

On Friday, in a series of tweets, he criticized Senate Republicans who voted against repealing Obamacare and ranted about the need to change the chamber<U+0089><U+06EA>s rules, which he still doesn<U+0089><U+06EA>t understand. He seems to think Obamacare repeal could have passed if the Senate only required 51 votes for its passage instead of 60. It couldn<U+0089><U+06EA>t even get 50 votes. But if there<U+0089><U+06EA>s one thing Trump claims to love, it<U+0089><U+06EA>s winning.

92,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/juggalos-donald-trump-rally_us_59bd9754e4b02da0e1427777","Nine months into the administration of President Donald Trump , fans of the eccentric Detroit rap duo Insane Clown Posse assembled a larger rally on the national mall this Saturday than the president<U+0089><U+06EA>s diehard supporters stationed a few hundred yards away. The dueling rallies reflected the difficulty that any sitting president has in mobilizing his base, and the particular challenge that Trump has as he struggles to pass major legislation and honor his campaign promises. Unlike the pro-Trump rally, Juggalos, as clown-makeup-wearing Insane Clown Posse fans call themselves, protested on the National Mall on Saturday for an actual specific purpose. That could explain why the gathering that surrounded the base of the reflection pool at the Lincoln Memorial this afternoon was significantly larger than the pro-Trump rally. In 2011, the FBI<U+0089><U+06EA>s National Gang Intelligence Center designated Juggalos, who say they are simply fans of a band, as a <U+0089><db><cf>loosely organized hybrid gang,<U+0089><U+06DD> saying a subset of the group is involved in criminal activity. The agency sent out briefing materials to all law enforcement offices around the country listing Juggalos as a gang alongside Crips, Bloods and MS-13. They pointed out particular signs to look for to see if a person was a Juggalo, like the <U+0089><db><cf>hatchet man<U+0089><U+06DD> symbol of the Insane Clown Posse. The result was that people who counted themselves fans of Insane Clown Posse have been fired from their jobs, lost children in custody battles and were targeted and harassed by police. Kevin Gill, an employee for the band and host of a Juggalo podcast, gave the opening remarks, calling the rally, <U+0089><db><cf>The most important day in Juggalo history.<U+0089><U+06DD> This protest was <U+0089><db><cf>some monumental shit,<U+0089><U+06DD> he added, before ripping into a denunciation of the FBI for categorizing Juggalos as a gang. In response, the crowd broke into a raucous chant about the much-hated FBI, <U+0089><db><cf>They fucked up! They fucked up!<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><cf>Give us back our fucking civil rights,<U+0089><U+06DD> Gill shouted. Gill and every other speaker at the Juggalo rally preached inclusivity with a passion that speakers at the pro-Trump rally reserved for subjects liker border security. <U+0089><db><cf>We don<U+0089><U+06EA>t care if you<U+0089><U+06EA>re black, white, Hispanic, straight, gay, trans, fat as fuck or skinny as a broom stick,<U+0089><U+06DD> Gill said, adding everyone is welcome to be or support Juggalos. This was largely the message from the Juggalos in attendance. <U+0089><db><cf>At the core of it, it<U+0089><U+06EA>s just a battle cry against discrimination,<U+0089><U+06DD> Christian Ike, a Juggalo who traveled from Los Angeles for the protest, told HuffPost. <U+0089><db><cf>Obviously there<U+0089><U+06EA>s worse discrimination in this country than what the Juggalos are facing. But we<U+0089><U+06EA>re here to say that we<U+0089><U+06EA>re also with those people.<U+0089><U+06DD> Jessica, a Juggalo from Arlington, Virginia, who declined to give her last name, told HuffPost, <U+0089><db><cf>We<U+0089><U+06EA>re not a gang. We don<U+0089><U+06EA>t do that. We<U+0089><U+06EA>re about love and family.<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><cf>I<U+0089><U+06EA>m tired of the FBI going around harassing people, pulling them over, people getting fired,<U+0089><U+06DD> Kev aka <U+0089><db><cf>Juggs<U+0089><U+06DD> from the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, said. Four speakers recounted the ways that their lives have been negatively impacted by the FBI<U+0089><U+06EA>s designation of Juggalos as a gang. New Mexico resident Crystal Guerrero said that she lost custody of two children because she went to one Insane Clown Posse show. Laura King of Fredericksburg, Virginia, recounted how she was permanently placed on a gang registry while she was on probation for a DUI offense because she had a tattoo of the hatchet man symbol. Jessica Bonometti was fired from her job as a probation officer in Woodbridge, Virginia, because she liked some Insane Clown Posse-related photographs on Facebook. Zac, a Juggalo from Utah County, Utah, wearing a bright orange suit while holding the Utah state flag, told HuffPost that he had been harassed numerous times by police and private security just for wearing Insane Clown Posse T-shirts and having bumper stickers on his car. He said that he doesn<U+0089><U+06EA>t wear the clothes or decorate his car the way he<U+0089><U+06EA>d like to because it makes him a target. <U+0089><db><cf>I do not support Insane Clown Posse the way I normally would and I feel that it<U+0089><U+06EA>s in violation of my rights as an American to support a band and that<U+0089><U+06EA>s why I<U+0089><U+06EA>m here,<U+0089><U+06DD> he said. Further east on the mall, closer to the U.S. Capitol building, pro-Trump activists had convened the <U+0089><db><cf>Mother of All Rallies,<U+0089><U+06DD> to <U+0089><db><cf>help send a message to Congress, the media and the world: we stand united to defend American culture and values.<U+0089><U+06DD> As it turned out, the self-described <U+0089><db><cf>Woodstock of American rallies,<U+0089><U+06DD> drew just a few hundred people, leaving much of the enclosed grass area allotted to the group empty for the duration of the afternoon. The lineup of speakers consisted mainly of D-list conservative leaders like Marco Gutierrez, the founder of Latinos for Trump, who famously warned that if the country did not curb immigration there would be <U+0089><db><cf>taco trucks on every corner.<U+0089><U+06DD> No Republican members of Congress or elected officials of any major office were there. The rally organizers made a point of condemning racism on their website , advising attendees, in all caps, <U+0089><db><cf>NO CONFEDERATE FLAGS, NO COMMUNIST FLAGS, NO FOREIGN FLAGS ALLOWED.<U+0089><U+06DD> It was not clear if the members of the Oathkeepers and other right-wing militiamen in khaki tactical vests at the perimeter of the rally strictly enforced this dictum. But for the most part, the gathering appeared to be free of Confederate flags or overtly white supremacist paraphernalia of the kind on display at the clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August. Jacob Boslet, a 19-year-old from Altoona, Pennsylvania, was waving a <U+0089><db><cf>Kekistan<U+0089><U+06DD> flag popular on the alt-right that resembles a particular version of the Nazi flag. Boslet, whose brother was attending the Juggalo rally, claimed that he was waving the flag to make a statement in support of <U+0089><db><cf>free speech,<U+0089><U+06DD> not white nationalism, which he condemns. <U+0089><db><cf>This is to promote the idea that you can create your own entity regardless if it offends someone or not, or someone has already taken it. Look at it <U+0089><U+06E5> it looks stupid and is a joke,<U+0089><U+06DD> Boslet said. There were flashes of the tensions that have flared up between either white supremacists or Trump supporters and left-leaning counterprotesters. Outside the rally perimeter, a group of self-described <U+0089><db><cf>antifascists<U+0089><U+06DD> or Antifa members, some of whom concealed their faces with black bandanas, got into heated political arguments with rally attendees. As the friction increased, U.S. Park Police officers got between the two groups, in an attempt to prevent violence. In short, it was a classic <U+0089><db><cf>Make America Great Again<U+0089><U+06DD> rally reminiscent of those that buoyed Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s campaign <U+0089><U+06E5> save for the fact that it lacked both Trump and the throngs of supporters that flocked to him on the campaign trail. At one point, a speaker even got the crowd into a chant of <U+0089><db><cf>Lock her up,<U+0089><U+06DD> the campaign-trail mantra about then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton . Asked about Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s stumbles, including the failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act, rally-goers universally blamed congressional Democrats and Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s Republican critics like Sens. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and John McCain (Ariz.). For the most part, they were not even especially perturbed by Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s apparent willingness to help undocumented immigrants who arrived as children stay in the country. <U+0089><db><cf>I don<U+0089><U+06EA>t really think that people want everyone who came here illegally deported because some of them are trying to build a future for themselves and a future for their country,<U+0089><U+06DD> Boslet said. In many ways, the ralliers reflected the more independent nature of Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s fan base. Few if any attendees who spoke to Huffpost identified as Republicans. Jennifer McGarrity, a 43-year-old sales manager, who drove down from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to show support for the president, identified as a <U+0089><db><cf>pro-choice<U+0089><U+06DD> independent.<e5><ca>She was unfazed by Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s increased willingness to forge agreements with congressional Democrats. <U+0089><db><cf>He knows how to get the deal done when he wants his agenda to pass through so he<U+0089><U+06EA>ll talk to who he has to,<U+0089><U+06DD> she said. More than one rally attendee said that their only disappointment in Trump was his willingness to intervene militarily in foreign countries. <U+0089><db><cf>I<U+0089><U+06EA>m disappointed that he wants to be a war president. Instead of going toward a route of peace, he wants to wage war whether it be in Syria or North Korea,<U+0089><U+06DD> said Manny Vega, a 32-year-old truck driver from Richmond, Virginia, who served four tours in Iraq with the Marines.

93,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-new-york-times-interview_us_59700842e4b0110cb3cb9745","In an interview with The New York Times published Wednesday, President Donald Trump made a series of shocking statements about his administration<U+0089><U+06EA>s ties to Russia, ongoing investigations into collusion with a foreign government and his waning happiness with senior officials in the White House . Here are some of the most eyebrow-raising passages from the exclusive sit-down: You can read the Times<U+0089><U+06EA> full story here and excerpts from their interview here Trump would not have appointed Attorney General Jeff Sessions if he<U+0089><U+06EA>d known he would recuse himself from the Russia probe. <U+0089><db><cf> Jeff Sessions takes the job, gets into the job, recuses himself. I then have <U+0089><U+06E5> which, frankly, I think is very unfair to the president. How do you take a job and then recuse yourself? If he would have recused himself before the job, I would have said, <U+0089><db><f7>Thanks, Jeff, but I can<U+0089><U+06EA>t, you know, I<U+0089><U+06EA>m not going to take you.<U+0089><U+06EA> It<U+0089><U+06EA>s extremely unfair, and that<U+0089><U+06EA>s a mild word, to the president.<U+0089><U+06DD> Sessions recused himself from any future investigations into Russian influence on the 2016 presidential campaign after The Washington Post reported he had met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak twice last year and failed to disclose the meetings. He had previously told the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath he had not had any <U+0089><db><cf>communications with the Russians<U+0089><U+06DD> during the presidential campaign, which he participated in as a Trump surrogate. Trump said the office of special counsel Robert Mueller is full of conflicts of interest. <U+0089><db><cf>He was up here and he wanted the job,<U+0089><U+06DD> Mr. Trump said. After he was named special counsel, <U+0089><db><cf>I said, <U+0089><db><f7>What the hell is this all about?<U+0089><U+06EA> Talk about conflicts. But he was interviewing for the job. There were many other conflicts that I haven<U+0089><U+06EA>t said, but I will at some point.<U+0089><U+06DD> When Mueller was chosen to lead the Justice Department<U+0089><U+06EA>s probe into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, he garnered widespread praise from both sides of the aisle and was championed as an investigator with <U+0089><db><cf> sterling credentials .<U+0089><U+06DD> However, Trump implies that Mueller may have had a conflict of interest because he was on a shortlist to replace fired FBI Director James Comey . When he was named special counsel, Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s surrogates quickly began work to undercut Mueller<U+0089><U+06EA>s integrity , saying they questioned his impartiality due to his longtime friendship with Comey. News outlets the president is known to follow, including Fox News and InfoWars, have continued to cast doubt on the investigation, labeling it with a favorite phrase of Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s: <U+0089><db><cf>a witch hunt.<U+0089><U+06DD> The president claimed his second, previously undisclosed meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin lasted 15 minutes and <U+0089><db><cf>adoption<U+0089><U+06DD> came up. <U+0089><db><cf>The meal was going, and toward dessert I went down just to say hello to Melania, and while I was there I said hello to Putin. Really, pleasantries more than anything else. It was not a long conversation, but it was, you know, could be 15 minutes. Just talked about <U+0089><U+06E5> things. Actually, it was very interesting, we talked about adoption.<U+0089><U+06DD> The White House acknowledged Tuesday that Trump held a second, private conversation with Putin at the G-20 summit in Germany earlier this month. According to Ian Bremmer, the president of a consulting firm called the Eurasia Group, the talk lasted for about an hour and the only other person in on the conversation was a Kremlin interpreter. Bremmer told the Times that guests at the dinner where the interaction occurred were <U+0089><db><cf>confused<U+0089><U+06DD> and <U+0089><db><cf>flummoxed<U+0089><U+06DD> by it. <U+0089><db><cf>Never in my life as a political scientist have I seen two countries <U+0089><U+06E5> major countries <U+0089><U+06E5> with a constellation of national interests that are as dissonant while the two leaders seem to be doing everything possible to make nice and be close to each other,<U+0089><U+06DD> Bremmer told Bloomberg<U+0089><U+06EA>s Charlie Rose . The White House disputed the characterization of the talk as a <U+0089><db><cf>meeting<U+0089><U+06DD> and said it lasted a short while. <U+0089><db><cf>It was pleasantries and small talk,<U+0089><U+06DD> White House spokesman Sean Spicer said. Trump accused Comey, whom he abruptly fired in May, of using an unverified dossier of compromising material to keep his job. <U+0089><db><cf>In my opinion, he shared it so that I would think he had it out there,<U+0089><U+06DD> Mr. Trump said. As leverage? <U+0089><db><cf>Yeah, I think so,<U+0089><U+06DD> Mr. Trump said. <U+0089><db><cf>In retrospect.<U+0089><U+06DD> The president dismissed the assertions in the dossier: <U+0089><db><cf>When he brought it to me, I said this is really, made-up junk. I didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t think about any of it. I just thought about, man, this is such a phony deal.<U+0089><U+06DD> According to his testimony last month to the Senate Intelligence Committee, Comey first informed Trump about the existence of the dossier <U+0089><U+06E5> compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele <U+0089><U+06E5> in January after U.S. intelligence agents decided he should be told before anything was published by the media. Comey said the president again denied anything alleged in the document was accurate during a private dinner later that month and urged the then-director to investigate the material. <U+0089><db><cf>I replied that he should give that careful thought because it might create a narrative that we were investigating him personally, which we weren<U+0089><U+06EA>t, and because it was very difficult to prove a negative,<U+0089><U+06DD> Comey said in his prepared remarks . <U+0089><db><cf>He said he would think about it and asked me to think about it.<U+0089><U+06DD> The president once more denied the allegations in a call in late March, saying he <U+0089><db><cf>had not been involved with hookers in Russia,<U+0089><U+06DD> Comey recalled. Mueller would cross a <U+0089><db><cf>red line<U+0089><U+06DD> if he looked into the Trump family<U+0089><U+06EA>s finances beyond Russia. <U+0089><db><cf>If Mueller was looking at your finances and your family finances, unrelated to Russia <U+0089><db><d3> is that a red line?<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><cf>I would say yeah. I would say yes.<U+0089><U+06DD> As the Times reports, Trump did not say if he would consider firing Mueller, noting, <U+0089><db><cf>I can<U+0089><U+06EA>t answer that question because I don<U+0089><U+06EA>t think it<U+0089><U+06EA>s going to happen.<U+0089><U+06DD> Only the deputy attorney general who appointed the special counsel can directly fire him (that would be Rod Rosenstein, who is in charge of such decisions as Sessions has recused himself). However, Trump could fire Rosenstein and, as Politico reports, <U+0089><db><cf> continue down the line until a DOJ official acquiesced.<U+0089><U+06DD> Trump complained about Rosenstein, describing him as a man Sessions <U+0089><db><cf>hardly knew<U+0089><U+06DD> and alluding that he was annoyed the deputy attorney general was <U+0089><db><cf>from Baltimore.<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><cf>I said, <U+0089><db><f7>Who<U+0089><U+06EA>s your deputy?<U+0089><U+06EA> So his deputy he hardly knew, and that<U+0089><U+06EA>s Rosenstein, Rod Rosenstein, who is from Baltimore. There are very few Republicans in Baltimore, if any. So, he<U+0089><U+06EA>s from Baltimore.<U+0089><U+06DD> Rosenstein was born in Philadelphia and lived in Bethesda, Maryland ,<e5><ca>when he was U.S. attorney for the state. He has been described as the <U+0089><db><cf> poster child for the professional , competent, ethical and fair-minded prosecutor,<U+0089><U+06DD> and he told The Baltimore Sun in April he was ready to take up the No. 2 job at the Justice Department <U+0089><db><cf>without regard to partisan political consideration.<U+0089><U+06DD> Rosenstein made headlines earlier this year after a memo he drafted about Comey was cited by the president as his reasoning for firing the FBI director. In the document, Rosenstein criticized Comey<U+0089><U+06EA>s handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, but the deputy attorney general reportedly threatened to quit after he was painted by the White House as the driving force behind the dismissal of Comey. His nomination earned bipartisan support, and the Senate voted 94-6 to confirm him.",0,59.84,9.8,12.5,1228,62,"6 Wild Claims Trump Made In His Bizarre New York Times Interview",2017-07-20 00:36:00,"Nick Visser","Politics","@genassign,@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_gad,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_ga,donald-trump,james-b-comey,jeff-sessions,new-york-times,robert-mueller,rod-rosenstein,trump-family,type: news,vladimir-putin",459409,416496,459409,726336,53466,277993,1.102,1.147,1.957,2.244,200407,206296,52706,23209,263411,14494,49733,75122,71225,3230,146,58,9543,8985,253,173,132,"6 Wild Claims Trump Made In His Bizarre New York Times Interview",2017-07-20 00:36:00,"Nick Visser","Politics","@genassign,@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_gad,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_ga,donald-trump,james-b-comey,jeff-sessions,new-york-times,robert-mueller,rod-rosenstein,trump-family,type: news,vladimir-putin",459409,416496,459409,726336,53466,277993,1.102,1.147,1.957,2.244,200407,206296,52706,23209,263411,14494,49733,75122,71225,3230,146,58,9543,8985,253,173,132
94,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-arizona-rally_us_599cf690e4b0a296083adeee","President Donald Trump blasted the media, criticized members of Congress and suggested he<U+0089><U+06EA>d shut down the government to build a border wall during a frenzied, 77-minute campaign-style rally in Phoenix on Tuesday night that left some commentators wondering about his fitness for office. Trump is known for his lively rallies, but even by those standards this one was a particularly unrestrained and boisterous spectacle. Here is a breakdown of some of the wildest moments. 1. He kicked off the speech by rereading all his responses to the protests in Charlottesville. While going over his widely criticized initial response, Trump omitted the most controversial part of the statement , in which he blamed <U+0089><db><cf> many sides <U+0089><U+06DD> for the violence there. 2. He called out Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). <U+0089><db><cf>We have to speak to Mitch<U+0089><U+06DD> about eliminating the Senate filibuster, Trump said. (The filibuster was not a factor in stopping the Republican health care bill.) Earlier on Tuesday, The New York Times reported that Trump and McConnell have not spoken in weeks. 3. He suggested he<U+0089><U+06EA>d shut down the government if it meant he could get a wall built along the U.S.-Mexico border. <U+0089><db><cf>If we have to shut down that government, we<U+0089><U+06EA>re building that wall,<U+0089><U+06DD> Trump said.<e5><U+0289><db><cf>One way or another, we<U+0089><U+06EA>re going to get that wall.<U+0089><U+06DD> 4. He argued the media are <U+0089><db><cf>trying to take away our history, our heritage.<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><cf>The only thing giving a platform to these hate groups is the media itself and the fake news,<U+0089><U+06DD> Trump said. <U+0089><db><cf>I really think they don<U+0089><U+06EA>t like our country. I really believe that,<U+0089><U+06DD> he added. 5. He defended his remarks on Charlottesville by saying he <U+0089><db><cf>hit<U+0089><U+06DD> various racist groups. <U+0089><db><cf>I hit <U+0089><U+06EA>em with neo-Nazi, I hit <U+0089><U+06EA>em with everything,<U+0089><U+06DD> he said. <U+0089><db><cf>I got the white supremacist, I got the neo-Nazi, I got <U+0089><U+06EA>em all in there. Let<U+0089><U+06EA>s see. KKK? We have KKK. I got <U+0089><U+06EA>em all.<U+0089><U+06DD> 6. He lied and said cameras at the rally were being turned off as live-streams of the speech on cable news networks continued to roll. He specifically called out CNN, which aired Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s speech until the end. 7. He teased a pardon for Joe Arpaio , the former sheriff of Maricopa County who was convicted of criminal contempt. 8. He bragged about how he lives in a <U+0089><db><cf>bigger, more beautiful apartment<U+0089><U+06DD> than the journalists who cover him. 9. He lamented CNN<U+0089><U+06EA>s firing of Jeffrey Lord , a pro-Trump commentator formerly featured on the network.<e5><ca>Lord was fired for tweeting the Nazi salute <U+0089><db><cf>Sieg Heil<U+0089><U+06DD> earlier in August. 10. He slammed both Republican Arizona senators: Jeff Flake, who has recently spoken out against Trump , and John McCain, who cast a pivotal vote that caused the GOP<U+0089><U+06EA>s Obamacare repeal bill to flame out in the Senate in July. McCain is currently receiving treatment for brain cancer. 11. He, again, requested statues of George Washington be protected , a request he<U+0089><U+06EA>s made since many Confederate statues and monuments around the U.S. have been removed or relocated . 12. He suggested <U+0089><db><cf>we will probably end up terminating NAFTA at some point.<U+0089><U+06DD> 13. He praised Fox News and Sean Hannity.",0,64.1,8.2,11.5,515,33,"Here Are The Wildest Moments From Trump's Wild Arizona Rally",2017-08-23 00:21:00,"Paige Lavender","Politics","@health_depression,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_ga,donald-trump,hate-speech,republican-politics,type: news,us-news",458237,406639,458237,665291,62483,259528,1.076,1.145,1.921,2.107,181051,223128,54058,17422,257946,11332,32383,106123,97834,8075,1,16,23388,23047,243,7,91,"Here Are The Wildest Moments From Trump's Wild Arizona Rally",2017-08-23 00:21:00,"Paige Lavender","Politics","@health_depression,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_ga,donald-trump,hate-speech,republican-politics,type: news,us-news",458237,406639,458237,665291,62483,259528,1.076,1.145,1.921,2.107,181051,223128,54058,17422,257946,11332,32383,106123,97834,8075,1,16,23388,23047,243,7,91

Not one supporter we spoke to cast blame on the ex-judge from Gallant, who used to sign Bibles at his courthouse. Moore gave a short, stuttering speech before he left on Tuesday <U+0089><U+06E5> an uncomfortable bookend to an awkward 24 hours.

On Tuesday morning in Gallant, Moore and his horse Sassy were effectively chased out of his own polling center by a throng of reporters desperate for quotes about a possible ethics violation should he win. Nobody at his party had expected a loss like this. There were rumblings of discontent well before the ex-judge faced allegations of sexual assault.

99,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joe-biden-2020-harvey-weinstein_us_5a0a0ba8e4b00a6eece3a13e","Joe Biden is a man looking for his moment. Behind those famous aviators, he<U+0089><U+06EA>s surveying the landscape to see if 2020 might just be his year to fulfill his presidential dreams. Biden has already run for president twice. Although he didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t run in 2016, he thinks he could have won that race. When Hillary Clinton lost, she was heavily criticized for not having a populist economic message that could have reached the working-class white voters who swung over to Donald Trump. Those voters are the speciality of the former vice president, who was born in the Rust Belt city of Scranton, Pennsylvania. When he represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate, Biden was known for taking Amtrak to and from Washington, just like the regular people. Biden is now wondering if 2020 may be his time. <U+0089><db><cf> I<U+0089><U+06EA>m not closing the door . I<U+0089><U+06EA>ve been around too long and I<U+0089><U+06EA>m a great respecter of fate, but who knows what the situation is going to be a year and a half from now,<U+0089><U+06DD> he said Tuesday. According to Politico, Biden has also privately been telling people that as of now, he doesn<U+0089><U+06EA>t see anyone besides himself who could stop Trump from winning a second term. But 2020 may not be Biden<U+0089><U+06EA>s year. While he is better than many other Democrats at offering up economic populism, there are other rising movements for which he isn<U+0089><U+06EA>t well positioned to be the face of the party. Clinton lost. And with her defeat went many people<U+0089><U+06EA>s hope that the nation would finally have its first female president. Afterward, women <U+0089><U+06E5> some of whom had supported Clinton and some who did not <U+0089><U+06E5> launched a resistance movement to push back on Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s policies and get more politically engaged. Record numbers of women are now running for office. The movement has extended beyond politics. Men in entertainment, media, business and other areas are finally being held accountable for sexist behavior. From former Fox News host Bill O<U+0089><U+06EA>Reilly to producer Harvey Weinstein to comedian Louis C.K., men are losing their jobs after years of having sexually harassed or assaulted women with impunity. Biden is the wrong guy to bear the standard of any party purporting to speak for the victims of unaccountable power. In many ways, Anita Hill launched the movement against sexual harassment in 1991. Then a 35-year-old law professor, she publicly accused Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of having sexually harassed her when she worked for him. She faced a Senate Judiciary Committee composed entirely of white men. Although the Senate went on to confirm Thomas anyway, women around the country were captivated by her testimony. For the first time on national television, a woman was describing what so many of them faced every day in their jobs. <U+0089><db><cf>I<U+0089><U+06EA>ve seen movements come and go. And some are quite powerful. I<U+0089><U+06EA>ve not seen something like this. And I<U+0089><U+06EA>m hoping that<e5><ca>[it will] bring lasting change,<U+0089><U+06DD> Hill told CNN last week on the progress that has been made since her testimony. Hill has previously said she doesn<U+0089><U+06EA>t believe her allegations against Thomas received the consideration they deserved. There were other women who were ready to support her allegations, but they were never allowed to testify before the Judiciary Committee. The man who could have changed that was Biden, who served as chair of the committee in 1991. In the years since,<e5><ca>he has publicly presented himself as Hill<U+0089><U+06EA>s ally , but she made clear in an interview with HuffPost in 2014 that she believes the senator let her down. <U+0089><db><cf>There were three women who were ready and waiting and subpoenaed to be giving testimony about similar behavior that they had experienced or witnessed. He failed to call them ,<U+0089><U+06DD><e5><ca>Hill said. <U+0089><db><cf>There also were experts who could have given real information as opposed to the misinformation that the Senate was giving ... and helped the public understand sexual harassment. He failed to call them.<U+0089><U+06DD> Biden told The New York Times two days before Hill was set to testify that he began by assuming that Thomas was innocent <U+0089><U+06E5> and, as it follows, by assuming that Hill was lying. <U+0089><db><cf>I must start off with a presumption of giving the person accused the benefit of the doubt ,<U+0089><U+06DD> Biden said. <U+0089><db><cf>I must seek the truth and I must ask straightforward and tough questions, and in my heart I know if that woman is telling the truth it will be almost unfair to her. On the other hand, if I don<U+0089><U+06EA>t ask legitimate questions, then I am doing a great injustice to someone who might be totally innocent. It<U+0089><U+06EA>s a horrible dilemma because you have two lives at stake here.<U+0089><U+06DD> Since that time, Biden has built a long record of championing women<U+0089><U+06EA>s rights. As vice president, he sought to address the scourge of sexual assault on college campuses and fought to make the matter a priority in the Obama administration. But part of his record remains the way he treated Hill. And for that, he has never fully apologized. Instead, on Monday, he said he felt bad that Hill felt she had been mistreated <U+0089><U+06E5> but he still insisted he was her champion. <U+0089><db><cf>I feel really badly that she didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t feel like the process worked, but I tell you what, I said something at the time that proved to be right,<U+0089><U+06DD><e5><ca>Biden said. <U+0089><db><cf>I said this is going to be the start of a fundamental change of what constitutes harassment in the workplace and people are going to begin to change.<U+0089><U+06DD> Biden was correct. But it was in large part because of the way Hill was treated and the way he handled the hearing that people started talking. Women saw Hill go up against the white men on the Senate Judiciary Committee <U+0089><U+06E5> who were either unsympathetic to what she had gone through or simply didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t come to her assistance <U+0089><U+06E5> and decided that they needed to change the face of Congress. In response, a record number of women ran for Congress in 1992. And two new female senators finally took seats on the Judiciary Committee <U+0089><U+06E5> but not without a misstep by Biden . After then-Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) won her party<U+0089><U+06EA>s Senate primary, the chairman hand-delivered to her a dozen red roses with the note, <U+0089><db><cf> Welcome to the Senate Judiciary Committee .<U+0089><U+06DD> News reports at the time described the moment in highly gendered language <U+0089><U+06E5> that Biden had tried to <U+0089><db><cf>woo<U+0089><U+06DD> Boxer but was <U+0089><db><cf>scorned<U+0089><U+06DD> and that Biden had gone <U+0089><db><cf> courting <U+0089><U+06DD> while the new female senators played <U+0089><db><cf>hard to get.<U+0089><U+06DD> Boxer ultimately chose not to join the committee. Biden also continues to maintain <U+0089><U+06E5> as he did in his remarks Monday <U+0089><U+06E5> that he wanted the other women to testify on behalf of Hill. He claimed that they didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t want to do so and that they would have undercut Hill<U+0089><U+06EA>s testimony. That is not, however, the version of events that Hill and her legal team remember , as HuffPost has reported. They believe that Biden, like the other senators at the time, simply wanted to finish up Thomas<U+0089><U+06EA> confirmation hearing and move on <U+0089><U+06E5> even if it meant Hill would get the short end of the stick. Today, part of Biden<U+0089><U+06EA>s schtick is that he<U+0089><U+06EA>s Uncle Joe. He<U+0089><U+06EA>s the jovial guy who can go into a bar and connect with anyone there. During the Obama administration, his ability to glad-hand and connect with people in an entertaining way was on full display every two years when he greeted the new senators and their families as they were sworn in. He<U+0089><U+06EA>d schmooze and make jokes with little kids and elderly relatives alike. His behavior also had more patronizing undercurrents.<e5><ca>A big part of his act was remarking on the attractiveness of women, young and old. He would comment on how pretty young women were and warn their fathers to keep the guys away. Many people found this behavior charming.<e5><ca>He wasn<U+0089><U+06EA>t stiff like some politicians. He grabbed people<U+0089><U+06EA>s hands, put his arm around them and even kissed people on the cheek. But it<U+0089><U+06EA>s clear some people were uncomfortable. The teenage daughter of Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), for example, visibly cringed and pulled away when Biden whispered in her ear and kissed her on the head. In 2015, when Biden put his arms on the wife of Defense Secretary Ash Carter at Carter<U+0089><U+06EA>s swearing-in ceremony, people noticed how uncomfortable the moment looked. There are plenty of other examples. New York Magazine even had a slideshow of them called <U+0089><db><cf> 9 Times Joe Biden Creepily Whispered in Women<U+0089><U+06EA>s Ears .<U+0089><U+06DD> In 2015, conservative columnist Byron York wrote about Biden<U+0089><U+06EA>s handsy ways,<e5><ca>questioning whether his gestures were appropriate . <U+0089><db><cf>Do the incidents add up to anything? Assume that all of Biden<U+0089><U+06EA>s gestures were entirely innocent, just Joe being Joe,<U+0089><U+06DD> York wrote. <U+0089><db><cf>Still, in today<U+0089><U+06EA>s society, sexual harassment complaints have been lodged for less. Biden<U+0089><U+06EA>s behavior gives critics plenty of ammunition and puts supporters in a difficult position.

He said: <U+0089><db><cf>So pre-existing conditions are a tough deal. Because you are basically saying from the moment the insurance, you<U+0089><U+06EA>re 21 years old, you start working and you<U+0089><U+06EA>re paying $12 a year for insurance, and by the time you<U+0089><U+06EA>re 70, you get a nice plan.<U+0089><U+06DD> The notion of paying $12 a year for health insurance is even less than the $ 15 per month number Trump floated in an interview with the Economist earlier this year. <U+0089><db><cf>Insurance is, you<U+0089><U+06EA>re 20 years old, you just graduated from college, and you start paying $15 a month for the rest of your life and by the time you<U+0089><U+06EA>re 70, and you really need it, you<U+0089><U+06EA>re still paying the same amount and that<U+0089><U+06EA>s really insurance,<U+0089><U+06DD> he said in the May interview. The average premium for a single person who gets health benefits from an employer last year was $536 a month , with employees paying an average of 18 percent of the cost while employers pick up the rest, according to data from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Education Trust. Prices are different in the market for people who don<U+0089><U+06EA>t get health benefits from an employer or a government program <U+0089><U+06E5> including those who purchase policies directly, through a broker or a health insurance exchange.

All of those numbers, of course, are significantly higher than either figure suggested by the president. This prompted a number of observers to wonder if Trump was confusing health insurance with the life insurance ads that air in heavy rotation on cable news.

101,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-the-fast-food-president_us_598344d9e4b0fa1575fc6830","Donald Trump loves fast food . The 45th president has no problem wolfing down a Quarter Pounder or digging his way through a bucket of KFC. <U+0089><U+06DD> Great stuff ,<U+0089><U+06DD> he once called the cheap, greasy fare. Six months into Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s presidency, the fast-food industry has plenty of reason to love him back. The oil and gas sector, coal producers and for-profit colleges are all clear winners in the Trump team<U+0089><U+06EA>s mission to deconstruct the administrative state . But so far, fast food, retail and other lower-wage industries have benefited as much as anyone from the administration<U+0089><U+06EA>s great regulatory rollback. Lobbyists for restaurants, hotels and other franchised businesses spent the last several years fighting the Obama administration on one regulation after another. But the new White House occupant has heard their grievances, making industry-friendly changes to employment laws and how they<U+0089><U+06EA>re enforced. That<U+0089><U+06EA>s included abandoning Obama<U+0089><U+06EA>s overtime reforms, shying away from a minimum wage raise, and limiting who<U+0089><U+06EA>s considered an <U+0089><db><cf>employer<U+0089><U+06DD> under the law <U+0089><U+06E5> all of which have a disproportionate effect on lower-wage, labor-intensive fields like fast food. All told, the new administration has given McDonald<U+0089><U+06EA>s and its friends plenty to cheer about. <U+0089><db><cf>The early signs are that it can be more like night and day in terms of approach,<U+0089><U+06DD> said Matt Haller, senior vice president at the International Franchise Association, an industry group representing franchisers, including McDonald<U+0089><U+06EA>s. <U+0089><db><cf>We just want regulations that are fair and reasonable and very clear.<U+0089><U+06DD> The previous White House viewed regulation as a means to lift up workers at the bottom of the economic ladder, particularly folks doing low-paid service work like fast food and hospitality. Hence their push for a higher mandated wage floor, expanded overtime protections and aggressive enforcement of wage and hour laws. Like Obama, Trump speaks often of forgotten workers whose pay has stagnated, but so far his prescription for improving their lot mainly involves unfettering their employers. That shouldn<U+0089><U+06EA>t come as a surprise for a president who made his fortune in hotels and went on to nominate a burger chain executive to be the country<U+0089><U+06EA>s top workplace watchdog. (Andrew Puzder, the former CEO of Hardee<U+0089><U+06EA>s and Carl<U+0089><U+06EA>s Jr., ended up withdrawing his controversial nomination.) Still, the degree to which the administration is taking the reins off employers has distressed past officials who took a more aggressive tack. <U+0089><db><cf>It<U+0089><U+06EA>s the combination of these policies that<U+0089><U+06EA>s deeply troubling,<U+0089><U+06DD> said David Weil, who led the Labor Department<U+0089><U+06EA>s Wage and Hour Division under Obama. <U+0089><db><cf>I see very little evidence that they are doing anything to address the needs of working people who have been left behind for a long time.<U+0089><U+06DD> While he was in office, Weil tried to steer the agency<U+0089><U+06EA>s investigations toward the industries where he saw the most vulnerable workers <U+0089><U+06E5> fast food, sit-down restaurants, hotels and motels, janitorial companies and so forth. A Labor Department spokesman said the agency under Trump still carries out what it calls <U+0089><db><cf>targeted enforcement<U+0089><U+06DD> programs. But pressed on whether they were targeting the same low-wage fields as before, the spokesman declined to say. Some of the changes under Trump have little practical impact, but speak volumes about the administration<U+0089><U+06EA>s peculiar form of populism. Employers in food and hospitality were apoplectic over the Obama administration<U+0089><U+06EA>s view on <U+0089><db><cf>joint employment<U+0089><U+06DD> : the idea that more than one entity might be responsible when a worker gets injured or shorted on pay. The Obama administration put companies on notice that they, too, could be responsible for abuses against workers who are technically employed by temp firms and contractors. Fast-food brands like McDonald<U+0089><U+06EA>s recoiled at the idea they might be as liable for workplace violations as the franchisees who operate McDonald<U+0089><U+06EA>s restaurants. After Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s second pick for labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, assumed office in April, one of the first steps the agency took was to rescind the guidance on joint employment issued under Obama. Speaking to a retail lobby last month, Vice President Mike Pence proudly noted the change , drawing applause. In another early move, the Labor Department brought back what are known as <U+0089><db><cf>opinion letters.<U+0089><U+06DD> When employers are sued for allegedly not paying overtime or the minimum wage, they can ask the Labor Department to pen one of these letters in their defense, to be used in court. Weil likens them to a <U+0089><db><cf>get-out-of-jail-free card<U+0089><U+06DD> for employers, and the Obama administration did not issue them. Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s Labor Department, however, has trumpeted their return . Trump also rescinded an executive order from Obama that would have made it harder for firms to secure federal contracts if they have a documented history of wage theft. Obama<U+0089><U+06EA>s order was the result of a campaign by fast-food workers who had been shorted on their pay while working on federal properties. (Two other orders from Obama <U+0089><U+06E5> one raising the minimum wage for federal contractors and another mandating sick leave for them<e5><U+0289><U+06E5> have so far survived this administration.) Other changes on the employment front are far more significant. The Obama administration tried to reform the nation<U+0089><U+06EA>s overtime rules and guarantee more workers time and a half pay when they work more than 40 hours in a week. The share of salaried employees who are protected by overtime law has dropped off a cliff since the 1970s. The changes the Obama administration made would have extended overtime rights to 4 million additional workers, according to the previous White House. After business groups sued to stop Obama<U+0089><U+06EA>s plan, the Trump White House declined to defend it . The new administration seems to share the view of business groups that Obama<U+0089><U+06EA>s proposal covered too many workers and was too costly for employers. If Trump takes his own crack at overtime reform, it<U+0089><U+06EA>s likely he<U+0089><U+06EA>ll make far fewer workers eligible for time and a half pay. Many of the people Obama<U+0089><U+06EA>s reforms aimed to help work in food and retail jobs, earning relatively low salaries while clocking long days. A group of Chipotle workers recently sued the burrito chain for backpay, arguing Obama<U+0089><U+06EA>s overtime changes should still apply even though the rule is now in legal limbo. The case hasn<U+0089><U+06EA>t yet been decided. As with the overtime expansion, this White House has abandoned the push for a higher minimum wage made by Obama. The idea of hiking the minimum wage tends to poll well across party lines; although he flip-flopped on the issue as a candidate, Trump once said he would like to raise it to <U+0089><db><cf>at least $10.<U+0089><U+06DD> But so far as president, he seems intent to leave such matters to the market. The federal minimum wage, which prevails in any state without a higher one, is currently $7.25 per hour and hasn<U+0089><U+06EA>t been raised in eight years. Beyond the major policy shifts, Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s effect on low-wage work will be felt in less obvious ways. He recently made two nominations to the five-member National Labor Relations Board, which interprets collective bargaining law and referees disputes between employers and unions. His conservative choices <U+0089><U+06E5> one is a management-side attorney, the other a former GOP staffer who served on the House labor committee <U+0089><U+06E5> would end the current liberal majority and push the board to the right. (One of them has already been confirmed.) If history is any indication, the Republican board would likely reverse some union-friendly rulings and draw tighter boundaries around who<U+0089><U+06EA>s eligible to unionize. Celine McNicholas, a labor policy expert at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said the board is one way Trump could chip away at what she considered modest gains made for lower-income workers during the Obama years. <U+0089><db><cf>These potential setbacks are going to prove to be incredibly damaging, particularly for folks who are low-wage workers,<U+0089><U+06DD> McNicholas said. <U+0089><db><cf>They are certainly losers under the Trump administration.<U+0089><U+06DD> One potential beneficiary of the new board is McDonald<U+0089><U+06EA>s. The fast-food giant recently went to trial before an administrative law judge at the labor board to determine whether it counts as a joint employer alongside its franchisees; McDonald<U+0089><U+06EA>s could be held jointly responsible for violating workers<U+0089><U+06EA> rights. In general, a conservative labor board would be more likely to side with employers in such contentious cases. The board<U+0089><U+06EA>s general counsel, Richard Griffin, who functions as a quasi-prosecutor, brought the case against McDonald<U+0089><U+06EA>s on behalf of workers who claimed they<U+0089><U+06EA>d been illegally retaliated against for their activism in the Fight for $15 protests. A former union lawyer, Griffin assumed the post in 2013 and has been a thorn in the side of not just McDonald<U+0089><U+06EA>s but also Walmart and other employers he<U+0089><U+06EA>s taken to trial. His aggressive tenure has so infuriated business groups that some Republicans have demanded that he step down. But at this point, that would no longer be necessary. Griffin<U+0089><U+06EA>s four-year term expires in November. It will be up to Trump to choose his replacement.",1,50.06,11.5,13.5,1453,69,"Donald Trump Is The Fast-Food President",2017-08-05 07:01:00,"Dave Jamieson","Politics","@amazonecho,@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_national_beats,donald-trump,mcdonalds,type: news,united-states-department-of-labor,us-department-of-labor",444990,419179,444990,337062,70693,240166,1.033,1.065,1.068,1.096,142285,248137,54568,67316,217724,61496,33419,39604,35389,4055,12,29,10854,10572,177,44,61,"Donald Trump Is The Fast-Food President",2017-08-05 07:01:00,"Dave Jamieson","Politics","@amazonecho,@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_national_beats,donald-trump,mcdonalds,type: news,united-states-department-of-labor,us-department-of-labor",444990,419179,444990,337062,70693,240166,1.033,1.065,1.068,1.096,142285,248137,54568,67316,217724,61496,33419,39604,35389,4055,12,29,10854,10572,177,44,61

103,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hurricane-harvey-texas-republicans-sandy-hypocrisy_us_59a46fcce4b041393a1fc43a","WASHINGTON <U+0089><U+06E5> Texas Republicans, long accustomed to bashing the federal government, are already changing their tune now that Hurricane Harvey has devastated parts of their state. An emergency aid package hasn<U+0089><U+06EA>t surfaced yet, but Congress almost certainly will have to approve a spending bill to help those affected by the hurricane-force winds and widespread flooding in southeastern Texas. The question is whether that money will be offset by cuts to other government programs, whether extraneous spending will be attached to the package, and whether, under any circumstances, Texas Republicans will have a problem voting for it. Money to help those in need from a lawmaker<U+0089><U+06EA>s homestate isn<U+0089><U+06EA>t a particularly tough vote. At this point, no Texas Republican has declared any sort of condition for their support of an emergency aid package. But when it was New York and New Jersey hit hard by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, all but one Texas Republican in Congress <U+0089><U+06E5> Rep. John Culberson <U+0089><U+06E5> voted against a $50.5 billion package to help people in those states. That was no surprise. The Texas delegation tends to speak with one voice , and there<U+0089><U+06EA>s little political repercussions for its members to vote against government largesse for another state. Many Republicans at the time said they took issue with unrelated spending that was attached to the Sandy bill, though most of the funding was directed at helping the storm<U+0089><U+06EA>s victims. And even some of the most derided provisions <U+0089><U+06E5> like $2 million to repair Smithsonian roofs in Washington <U+0089><U+06E5> were, in fact, related to that storm (it brought heavy wind and rain to that nation<U+0089><U+06EA>s capital, as well.) Overall, according to an analysis of the legislation compiled by CQ, the Sandy aid bill included $16 billion for community development programs, $11.5 billion for FEMA<U+0089><U+06EA>s disaster relief fund, $10.9 billion for transportation system repairs, $5.4 billion for Army Corps of Engineers projects, $800 million for social service programs, and $826 million for repairs to national parks and facilities. But Texas Republicans latched onto the notion that the Sandy relief package was full of wasteful spending. When the Senate was voting on the bill in early 2013, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) railed against the <U+0089><db><cf>unrelated spending, including projects such as Smithsonian repairs, upgrades to National Oceanic and Atmospheric airplanes, and more funding for Head Start.<U+0089><U+06DD> Again, the Smithsonian repairs <U+0089><U+06E5> representing .004 percent of the money appropriated <U+0089><U+06E5> were related to Sandy, and the upgrades and repairs to NOAA aircraft were to help with future hurricane forecasting. The money for Head Start, meanwhile, was available only to those facilities damaged by Sandy. On Monday, when Cruz was asked about voting against Sandy aid in 2013 but now openly seeking help for his state, he said there would be time for <U+0089><db><cf>political sniping<U+0089><U+06DD> later. <U+0089><db><cf>The problem with that particular bill,<U+0089><U+06DD> Cruz said of the Sandy package on MSNBC, <U+0089><db><cf>is it became a $50 billion bill that was filled with unrelated pork. Two-thirds of that bill had nothing to do with Sandy, and what I said then and still believe now is that it<U+0089><U+06EA>s not right for politicians to exploit a disaster and people hurting to pay for their own political wishlist.<U+0089><U+06DD> Cruz seems to be referring to the fact that only $17 billion of the package was for immediate relief and recovery needs, while other spending was for longer-term projects. Notwithstanding Cruz<U+0089><U+06EA>s call for a moratorium on <U+0089><db><cf>political sniping,<U+0089><U+06DD> s ome New York and New Jersey Republicans couldn<U+0089><U+06EA>t help but take a few shots at the Texas delegation on Monday, even as they affirmed that they would support those people in need. Rep. Peter King, whose district encompasses parts of Long Island, tweeted that he wouldn<U+0089><U+06EA>t <U+0089><db><cf>abandon Texas the way Ted Cruz did New York;<U+0089><U+06DD> New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called the Texas lawmakers <U+0089><db><cf> hypocrites ; <U+0089><U+06DD> and Rep. Frank LoBiondo of the Garden State tweeted that d espite the stance of his Texas colleagues on the Sandy relief package, he would support emergency money for their constituents. Overall, 23 of the 24 Texas Republicans then in the House voted against the Sandy package. And joining Cruz in opposing it was the state<U+0089><U+06EA>s other senator, John Cornyn (who<U+0089><U+06EA>s now that chamber<U+0089><U+06EA>s majority whip). HuffPost reached out Monday morning to the offices of the 20 Texas Republicans still in the House, as well as staff members for Cruz and Cornyn, with questions that included whether they thought emergency aid for their state ought to be offset with spending cuts elsewhere and whether they could commit to backing the storm-related funding even if it is not offset and the bill contains some extraneous spending provisions. As of late Monday afternoon, only House Rules Chairman Pete Sessions<U+0089><U+06EA> staff responded and <U+0089><U+06E5> no shocker here <U+0089><U+06E5> the lawmaker has no reservations about supporting aid for Texas. With President Donald Trump already touting his administration<U+0089><U+06EA>s response to Hurricane Harvey, members of his team also find themselves facing a course reversal from their previous political principles. Vice President Mike Pence, for instance, as a House member from Indiana led the conservative call to offset emergency spending in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina hammered Louisiana and Mississippi. Pence said Monday he expected Congress to make resources available for Texas, with no mention of strings attached. Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney <U+0089><U+06E5> who as a House member from South Carolina pushed for offsets to the Sandy bill<U+0089><U+06EA>s spending and voted against the package <U+0089><U+06E5> now will be in charge of putting together the administration<U+0089><U+06EA>s emergency request for Texas. Hardly anyone expects Mulvaney to insist that those emergency dollars be paid for with cuts elsewhere. It<U+0089><U+06EA>s possible that the package just gets attached to an upcoming bill to keep the government operating past Sept. 30. In that case, a number of Republicans <U+0089><U+06E5> including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who opposed the Sandy bill <U+0089><U+06E5> could be spared from the political hypocrisy of supporting aid now. After all, they could explain their <U+0089><db><cf>yes<U+0089><U+06DD> vote by simply focusing on the need to keep the government open. And they<U+0089><U+06EA>ll be able to decide if supporting aid for the next natural disaster fits with their political agenda without worry that someone might throw this vote back in their face.

The property has a flood insurance policy through the National Flood Insurance Program , a Federal Emergency Management Agency spokesperson told HuffPost. The program provides affordable insurance in flood-prone zones where private insurers have traditionally refused to insure properties because they<U+0089><U+06EA>re so vulnerable. The Mar-a-Lago club<U+0089><U+06EA>s policy, which is insured to the Trump Organization and Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, is not subsidized and is classified at a full-risk rate for the applicable flood zone, the FEMA spokesperson said. A property covered at the <U+0089><db><cf>full-risk<U+0089><U+06DD> rate means that its owner is paying a rate that reflects the full risk of flooding up to a certain coverage amount . Older properties can be <U+0089><db><cf>subsidized,<U+0089><U+06DD> meaning their rates do not necessarily reflect the full risk for those properties. The 1968-era National Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP, offers a mix of rates. The insurance program<U+0089><U+06EA>s authorization was set to expire at the end of this month, but Trump signed legislation on Friday that temporarily extends it . NFIP as a whole has been criticized for not charging enough to cover the expected costs of liabilities . It also consistently does not bring in enough money to pay out the properties it insures, and owes around $25 billion to the U.S. Treasury. Based on policies that went into effect on Aug.<e5><ca>31, 2016, the program is projected to have a one-year shortfall of $1.4 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report published this month. Some critics say the program benefits affluent people who live on beachfront property , essentially allowing them to live in places that are at a high risk of being damaged. <U+0089><db><cf>If [NFIP] was a regular insurance company, they would have been in receivership,<U+0089><U+06DD> Burl Daniel, an insurance expert witness from Texas, told HuffPost. <U+0089><db><cf>But it<U+0089><U+06EA>s a political football because of the people who live on the coast.<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><cf>The program was already in trouble<U+0089><U+06DD> before Hurricanes Harvey and Irma began approaching the U.S., said Karen O<U+0089><U+06EA>Neill, an associate professor at Rutgers University who studies how policies about land and water affect government power. <U+0089><db><cf>It became super in trouble after Katrina, and Sandy was another blow,<U+0089><U+06DD> O<U+0089><U+06EA>Neill said. Mar-a-Lago, Trump International Golf Club in Palm Beach and Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter are all closed in advance of Irma, a Trump Organization spokesperson said. (She did not respond to the question about insurance.) Irma, one of the largest storms ever recorded , is expected to hit Florida this weekend. Mar-a-Lago has weathered hurricanes before. According to a n Associated Press investigation , Trump claimed that he received a $17 million insurance payout for the estate in 2005 due to damage from a series of storms, but said he pocketed some of the money instead of using it to rebuild. Trump once boasted in a deposition that he had a <U+0089><db><cf> very good insurance policy , <U+0089><U+06DD> apparently in reference to private insurance. ( The FEMA spokesperson declined to comment on whether Mar-a-Lago was also insured by NFIP at the time, as that is <U+0089><db><cf>not publicly available information.<U+0089><U+06DD>) Mar-a-Lago, which Trump bought for $10 million in 1985 , could see its main buildings damaged by an 8-foot storm surge, according to the AP. Thirty years from now, the property could be under at least a foot of water for most of the year, according to a risk analysis prepared for the Guardian . A group of Democratic lawmakers introduced a bill in June that specifically aimed to block Trump properties from receiving any federal subsidy for flood insurance coverage. The name of the bill <U+0089><U+06E5> the Prohibiting Aid for Recipients Ignoring Science , or Paris, Act <U+0089><U+06E5> riffs off the Paris climate accord , an agreement from which Trump withdrew that same month. As FEMA noted,<e5><ca>the NFIP policy for Mar-a-Lago isn<U+0089><U+06EA>t explicitly subsidized. (HuffPost did not ask the agency about policy details for other Trump-owned properties in Florida.)

This comes as national attention focuses on several states blocking a request for voter information from President Donald Trump <U+0089><U+06EA>s commission to investigate voting fraud, which does occur, but is not a widespread problem . The DOJ sent the letter to 44 states last Wednesday, the same day the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity sent a letter controversially requesting personal voter information . The DOJ letter requests that election officials respond by detailing their compliance with a section of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA), which covers 44 states and was enacted to help people register to vote, but also specifies when voters may be kicked off the rolls. Several experts said it<U+0089><U+06EA>s difficult not to see the DOJ letter in connection with the commission<U+0089><U+06EA>s letter as part of a multipronged effort to restrict voting rights. Former Justice Department officials say that while there<U+0089><U+06EA>s nothing notable about seeking information about compliance with the NVRA, it is unusual for the department to send out such a broad inquiry to so many states seeking information. Such a wide probe could signal the department is broadly fishing for cases of non-compliance to bring suits aimed at purging the voter rolls. <U+0089><db><cf>These two letters, sent on the same day, are highly suspect, and seem to confirm that the Trump administration is laying the groundwork to suppress the right to vote,<U+0089><U+06DD> said Vanita Gupta, the CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and former head of DOJ<U+0089><U+06EA>s civil rights division under President Barack Obama. <U+0089><db><cf>It is not normal for the Department of Justice to ask for voting data from all states covered by the National Voter Registration Act. It<U+0089><U+06EA>s likely that this is instead the beginning of an effort to force unwarranted voter purges.<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><cf>If this went to any individual states, I don<U+0089><U+06EA>t think anybody would<U+0089><U+06EA>ve blinked twice,<U+0089><U+06DD> said Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School who served as deputy assistant attorney general in the civil rights division in the Obama administration. The letter asked for public information that was uncontroversial, he added, but what made the letter <U+0089><db><cf>really weird<U+0089><U+06DD> was that it was sent out to so many states. <U+0089><db><cf>The Department of Justice does investigations all the time, but those are usually based on individualized predicates to believe that there<U+0089><U+06EA>s a problem in a given area, in a given jurisdiction. And I<U+0089><U+06EA>m not aware of a similar letter being sent to blanket jurisdictions across the country,<U+0089><U+06DD> he said. The NVRA requires states to <U+0089><db><cf>conduct a general program that makes a reasonable effort to remove the names of ineligible voters from the official lists.<U+0089><U+06DD> If a state wants to act to remove a voter from its rolls, it must first send a broad, nondiscriminatory solicitation seeking a confirmation of address to those registered. If a person fails to respond, they can only be removed from the rolls if they don<U+0089><U+06EA>t vote in the next two consecutive federal elections. In the past, voting rights groups have used the legislation as a powerful tool to try to prevent states from kicking eligible voters off their rolls. The Supreme Court will consider a case next term dealing with whether a voter removal process used in Ohio is violating the NVRA. The DOJ letter asks the states covered by the NVRA to provide information on the processes they use to remove people from the voting lists and the people authorized to implement them. It also asks for data from recent years on the number of voters removed from the voting rolls and the reasons they were removed. <U+0089><db><cf>When you see DOJ send a bunch of letters like this requesting information about compliance with the law, that<U+0089><U+06EA>s usually a sign that they<U+0089><U+06EA>re kicking an enforcement campaign into gear,<U+0089><U+06DD> Sam Bagenstos, who served as the principal deputy assistant attorney general for civil rights from 2009 until 2011. <U+0089><db><cf>It looks like what they<U+0089><U+06EA>re doing is they<U+0089><U+06EA>re laying the groundwork to file lawsuits against states that, in their view, aren<U+0089><U+06EA>t kicking enough people off of the rolls.<U+0089><U+06DD> Devin O<U+0089><U+06EA>Malley, a Justice Department spokesman, said the department<U+0089><U+06EA>s review of list maintenance procedures hadn<U+0089><U+06EA>t been done in many years. <U+0089><db><cf>The Department of Justice is committed to free and fair elections for all Americans. Congress enacted the NVRA<U+0089><U+06EA>s list-maintenance provisions specifically to advance that goal. The Department had not conducted a review of state and local list-maintenance activities under the NVRA for many years,<U+0089><U+06DD> he said in a statement. <U+0089><db><cf>The Department looks forward to working with state and local election officials to facilitate appropriate list-maintenance activities toward our common goal of free and fair elections for all voters.<U+0089><U+06DD> A DOJ official also said the department had not coordinated with the separate election integrity commission. But Bagenstos said he was skeptical the two efforts weren<U+0089><U+06EA>t related and were part of a multifaceted approach by the Trump administration to make voting more difficult. <U+0089><db><cf>What an amazing coincidence that these letters went out on the same day. This administration is, without even knowing it, doing parallel efforts to try to trim the voting roll. I don<U+0089><U+06EA>t buy it,<U+0089><U+06DD> he said. He added that the voter fraud commission led by Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach was trying to create a nationwide database of voter registration that would paint a picture of potential voter fraud that could then be used to justify more restrictive voting laws. David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and a former DOJ lawyer, agrees. <U+0089><db><cf>In the quarter-century since passage of the NVRA, of which I spent seven years as a DOJ lawyer enforcing the NVRA, among other laws, I do not know of the DOJ conducting any other broad-based fishing expedition into list maintenance compliance, whether during Democratic or Republican administrations,<U+0089><U+06DD> he wrote in a Thursday op-ed . Becker also noted it was strange the DOJ letter only focused on voter list maintenance procedures and did not want to examine compliance with parts of the law aimed at making it easier to vote. Allegra Chapman, director of voting and elections at nonprofit group Common Cause, said she found it striking the DOJ was uninterested in the aspect of the law that provided voter registration opportunities at public assistance agencies. <U+0089><db><cf>To me, that indicates this agency just has zero interest in ensuring the rights of poor Americans too and ensuring that, you know, people across the income divide are equally being given the registration services that they<U+0089><U+06EA>re entitled to under federal law,<U+0089><U+06DD> she said in an interview. While Bagenstos said he was alarmed by both the Kobach and DOJ requests, he believed the department could be a much more potent tool in curbing access to the ballot box. <U+0089><db><cf>On Kris Kobach<U+0089><U+06EA>s work on this commission, they<U+0089><U+06EA>re going to get a lot of pushback, they<U+0089><U+06EA>ve already gotten some pushback from states. It<U+0089><U+06EA>s all been sort of ham-handed,<U+0089><U+06DD> he said. <U+0089><db><cf>They don<U+0089><U+06EA>t really have staff, so that<U+0089><U+06EA>s all really amateurish and it might not go anywhere. But the folks at DOJ know what they<U+0089><U+06EA>re doing and I really worry that at the end of the day there<U+0089><U+06EA>s gonna be a lot of noise about this Kobach-Pence commission and people will miss the enforcement efforts of DOJ.<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><cf>DOJ, at the end of the day, is more likely to be successful as a tool in this process than is this commission, so that<U+0089><U+06EA>s why I worry more about them,<U+0089><U+06DD> he said.

Several months before he left his job as a senior White House adviser last August, Bannon was talking to President Trump about the brewing political storm over the Justice Department investigation into his campaign<U+0089><U+06EA>s alleged ties to the Kremlin. Suddenly, Trump had an inspiration.<e5><ca>He looked straight at Bannon,<e5><ca>jabbed at him with his finger and uttered the phrase that would become the slogan of the White House pushback against the Russia probe: <U+0089><db><cf>Witch hunt!<U+0089><U+06DD> Brilliant,<e5><ca>thought Bannon, as he later related the exchange to colleagues. Ever since, it is a phrase Trump has returned to time and again <U+0089><db><d3> and repackaged with typical Trumpian hyperbole. <U+0089><db><cf>This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!<U+0089><U+06DD> Trump tweeted last May after ex-FBI director Robert Mueller was appointed as Justice Department special counsel to oversee the probe. But now, as Trump prepares to end his first year in office, the witch hunt narrative may have outlived its usefulness. Mueller<U+0089><U+06EA>s investigation has expanded and gained serious traction: The president<U+0089><U+06EA>s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and Manafort<U+0089><U+06EA>s chief deputy, Rick Gates, have been indicted. His former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, has pleaded guilty and is now a cooperating witness. So too is a former foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, who has admitted lying to the FBI about repeated contacts with alleged Russian cutouts who had offered the Trump campaign <U+0089><db><cf>dirt<U+0089><U+06DD> on Hillary Clinton in the form of <U+0089><db><cf>thousands of emails.<U+0089><U+06DD> As described by sources familiar with various aspects of the investigation, the Mueller probe is fast approaching a critical crossroads.<e5><ca>The president<U+0089><U+06EA>s lawyers, Ty Cobb and John Dowd, are pressing Mueller to wind down the investigation and exonerate their client, which they have assured the president will happen by early next year. But the sources familiar with the probe say that such a rapid conclusion is <U+0089><db><d3> as one put it <U+0089><db><d3> <U+0089><db><cf>fanciful.<U+0089><U+06DD> Mueller and his team, they say, are pursuing new leads, interrogating new witnesses and collecting a mountain of new evidence, including subpoenaed bank records and thousands of emails from the campaign and the Trump transition. In just the last few weeks, his prosecutors have begun questioning Republican National Committee staffers about the party digital operation that worked with the Trump campaign to target voters in key swing states. They are seeking to determine if the joint effort was related to the activities of Russian trolls and bots aimed at influencing the American electorate, according to two of the sources. In what is potentially another ominous sign for the White House, the lawyer for Jared Kushner, the president<U+0089><U+06EA>s son in law and senior adviser who was in charge of the campaign<U+0089><U+06EA>s digital operation, recently began searching for a crisis public relations firm to handle press inquiries <U+0089><db><d3> a step frequently taken by people who believe they may be facing criminal charges.<e5><ca>(Kushner has denied all wrongdoing, and his lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has said he is cooperating with the Mueller investigation.) Even if the new lines of inquiry don<U+0089><U+06EA>t result in additional indictments <U+0089><db><d3> something unknowable at this point <U+0089><db><d3> the new material all but guarantees the Mueller investigation will stretch on for months, if not years, likely provoking Trump to revisit his decision not to fire the special counsel. And if the president does take that step, many lawmakers and legal veterans say, it will cause a political explosion unlike any the capital has seen in decades. <U+0089><db><cf>It will be cataclysmic,<U+0089><U+06DD> said Richard Ben-Veniste, a former Watergate prosecutor who lived through the so-called Saturday night massacre when President Richard Nixon fired special prosecutor Archibald Cox. <U+0089><db><cf>It will create a constitutional crisis.<U+0089><U+06DD> In the meantime, the president<U+0089><U+06EA>s allies are mounting a ferocious attack on Mueller<U+0089><U+06EA>s team <U+0089><db><d3> pointing to tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions to Hillary Clinton and other Democrats by the special counsel<U+0089><U+06EA>s prosecutors, and to text messages disparaging Trump by FBI agent Peter Strzok, whom Mueller has since moved off the investigation.<e5><ca>They are also gunning for top FBI officials,<e5><ca>especially deputy director Andrew McCabe, who they believe began a counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign<U+0089><U+06EA>s links to the Russians last year based in part on the controversial dossier prepared by a former British spy and funded as <U+0089><db><cf>opposition research<U+0089><U+06DD> by the Clinton campaign. <U+0089><db><cf>Everything points to the fact that there was an orchestrated plan to try to prevent Donald Trump from being the next president of the United States,<U+0089><U+06DD> said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a member of the House Judiciary Committee,<e5><ca>in a recent television interview in which he vowed to subpoena senior FBI agents about the origins of the probe.  But for Democrats, the attacks on Mueller and the FBI are a distraction tactic meant to obscure how much has already been uncovered about the Trump team<U+0089><U+06EA>s contacts with the Russians. Back in January, when the issue first starting getting political traction, the president and his top aides denied that he and his campaign had any connections to Moscow. <U+0089><db><cf>I have nothing to do with Russia,<U+0089><U+06DD> Trump tweeted at the time. Since then, Mueller<U+0089><U+06EA>s team and congressional investigators have detailed numerous contacts, meetings and email exchanges between Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s campaign and Russian-connected operatives and officials that were unknown to the public when voters went to the polls in November 2016. Jeff Sessions, the Trump campaign<U+0089><U+06EA>s chief national security adviser, met with the Russian ambassador at a hotel reception and later in his Senate office. Papadopoulos met with a Russia-connected professor and a woman introduced as <U+0089><db><cf>Putin<U+0089><U+06EA>s niece<U+0089><U+06DD> in an effort to set up a summit between Trump and the Russian president. And most famously, Donald Trump Jr., Kushner and Manafort all met in Trump Tower with a delegation of Russians who they believed had derogatory information on Hillary Clinton <U+0089><db><d3> including <U+0089><db><cf>official documents<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><d3> that came straight from the highest levels of the Kremlin. <U+0089><db><cf>Just from what<U+0089><U+06EA>s been made public, it<U+0089><U+06EA>s pretty clear the Trump campaign and family were willing and eager to work with the Russians,<U+0089><U+06DD> said Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., a member of the House Intelligence Committee. <U+0089><db><cf>They showed almost no restraint in engaging with the Russians to see what they had to offer on their opponent. It was a <U+0089><db><f7>whatever it takes<U+0089><U+06EA> mentality.<U+0089><U+06DD> Whether all this adds up to <U+0089><db><cf>collusion<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><d3> the sensational charge of active collaboration between the Trump campaign and Moscow that was first laid out in the controversial dossier commissioned by the Clinton campaign <U+0089><db><d3> is far from clear.

Unfortunately, Trump Jr. doesn<U+0089><U+06EA>t seem to have all the facts in order. <U+0089><db><cf>I would pay good money to see all those people complaining about Obama<U+0089><U+06EA>s FCC chairman voting to repeal #NetNeutality actually explain it in detail,<U+0089><U+06DD> Trump Jr. wrote. <U+0089><db><cf>I<U+0089><U+06EA>d also bet most hadn<U+0089><U+06EA>t heard of it before this week. #outrage.<U+0089><U+06DD> In fact,<e5><ca>President Donald Trump designated Ajit Pai the FCC chairman in January. Former President Barack Obama appointed Pai to a five-year term on the commission in 2012, but Democrats fought against his term<U+0089><U+06EA>s renewal last year. The commission voted to repeal the net neutrality protections in a 3-2 vote, with Pai voting in the majority. Net neutrality rules were initially put in place to ensure that internet service providers, ISPs, treated all information and content across the web equally. Repealing the Title II protections would allow internet service providers, such as Verizon or Comcast, to decide what content would be blocked or offered at slower speeds in favor of the company<U+0089><U+06EA>s own content. Critics of Pai<U+0089><U+06EA>s repeal effort fear that ISPs will discriminate against internet traffic and charge companies such as Netflix or Amazon exorbitant fees to give consumers efficient access to those services. (HuffPost<U+0089><U+06EA>s parent company, Oath, is owned by Verizon. HuffPost is also represented by the Writers Guild of America, East, which supports net neutrality and opposed its repeal). Millions of Americans had protested Pai<U+0089><U+06EA>s plan to repeal net neutrality regulations. Citizens have protested to keep the rules in place , in addition to calling offices of public officials to protect the internet.<e5><ca>Congress could nullify the FCC decision with a Congressional Review Act resolution,<e5><ca>and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said Thursday that he would introduced one, but it<U+0089><U+06EA>s considered a long shot. More than 20 U.S. senators attempted to delay Thursday<U+0089><U+06EA>s vote after suspecting that the FCC was flooded with fraudulent comments , especially those in favor of the repeal. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman opened an investigation, which showed that up to 2 million comments were submitted under false names. Schneiderman announced that he would sue to prevent the rollbacks on Thursday. In a YouTube video , Schneiderman criticized the FCC<U+0089><U+06EA>s lack of assistance in his office<U+0089><U+06EA>s investigation and called the vote a travesty. <U+0089><db><cf>Today<U+0089><U+06EA>s vote also follows a public comment process that was deeply corrupted, including 2 million comments that stole the identities of real people,<U+0089><U+06DD> Schneiderman said in his video. <U+0089><db><cf>This is a crime under New York law <U+0089><U+06E5> and the FCC<U+0089><U+06EA>s decision to go ahead with the vote makes a mockery of government integrity and rewards the very perpetrators who scammed the system to advance their own agenda.<U+0089><U+06DD> Language in this story and its headline has been amended to clarify that while former President Barack Obama appointed Ajit Pai to the FCC, it was President Donald Trump who designated Pai the agency chairman.",0,44.64,11.5,13.4,508,28,"Trump Jr. Doesn't Seem To Know His Dad Designated The FCC Chairman",2017-12-14 22:14:00,"Doha Madani","Politics","@health_depression,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_huffpost_now,ajit-pai,donald-trump-jr,eric-schneiderman,federal-communications-commission,net-neutrality,type: news",430343,365112,430343,285839,48407,211438,1.07,1.134,0.952,1.131,181875,210924,37544,31174,183365,17816,64580,94502,74304,9974,5,75,25204,24681,389,9,125,"Trump Jr. Doesn't Seem To Know His Dad Designated The FCC Chairman",2017-12-14 22:14:00,"Doha Madani","Politics","@health_depression,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_huffpost_now,ajit-pai,donald-trump-jr,eric-schneiderman,federal-communications-commission,net-neutrality,type: news",430343,365112,430343,285839,48407,211438,1.07,1.134,0.952,1.131,181875,210924,37544,31174,183365,17816,64580,94502,74304,9974,5,75,25204,24681,389,9,125

Chris Christie got into a spat with a baseball fan at a game in Milwaukee on Sunday, his latest public relations snafu to cap a month of snafus.

The governor was at the stadium to watch the game between the Chicago Cubs and the Milwaukee Brewers. Christie<U+0089><U+06EA>s son works for the Brewers. A local news reporter for the station WISN12, Ben Hutchison, said he was a relative of the man Christie confronted, Brad Joseph. Joseph told the outlet he yelled the governor<U+0089><U+06EA>s name <U+0089><db><cf> and told him that he sucked ,<U+0089><U+06DD> which sparked the encounter. <U+0089><db><cf>I called him a hypocrite because I thought it needed to be said.

Twice Nehlen dodged the question. The third time he didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t respond. The Wisconsin Republican is running to replace House Speaker Paul Ryan, who might not be seeking re-election. Nehlen campaigned in Alabama recently for Roy Moore, the Senate nominee accused of sexual misconduct, who suffered a historic defeat Tuesday. Nehlen claims to have raised <U+0089><db><cf>six figures<U+0089><U+06DD> for the Moore campaign. Nehlen was a speaker Monday at Moore<U+0089><U+06EA>s campaign rally in Midland City, Alabama.

Earlier this month, Nehlen tweeted <U+0089><db><cf>It<U+0089><U+06EA>s okay to be white,<U+0089><U+06DD> a meme that originated on the message board 4chan, a haven for neo-Nazi trolls, and was spread enthusiastically by white nationalists. <U+0089><db><cf>In fact it<U+0089><U+06EA>s pretty awesome,<U+0089><U+06DD> he added in a follow-up tweet. On at least two occasions this month, Nehlen has retweeted racist memes shared by Mark Collett, a British Nazi sympathizer. On the night of Aug. 11, when neo-Nazis and other assorted racists marched with tiki torches through Charlottesville, Virginia, Nehlen retweeted an image of the march posted by white nationalist Jason Kessler: <U+0089><db><cf>Incredible moment for white people who<U+0089><U+06EA>ve had it up to here & aren<U+0089><U+06EA>t going to take it anymore.

Besides <U+0089><U+06E5> it<U+0089><U+06EA>s true that it<U+0089><U+06EA>s okay to be white <U+0089><U+06E5> it<U+0089><U+06EA>s pretty awesome in fact. Asked in a follow-up email to clarify whether or not he<U+0089><U+06EA>s a white nationalist with a simple yes or no, Nehlen responded: Given that the media is still determined to libel all conservatives as bigots, it seems some clarity on the definition of American Nationalism <U+0089><U+06E5> the idea that the United States should put the economic and security interests of American citizens ahead of the economic and security interests of illegal aliens and non-citizens <U+0089><U+06E5><e5><ca>is in order. In a third email Thursday, HuffPost noted that this was a definition of nationalism, but that it didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t answer the question as to whether Nehlen considers himself a white nationalist or a member of the alt-right. He didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t respond. Nehlen<U+0089><U+06EA>s association with the Moore campaign, which received funding from the Republican National Committee and was endorsed by President Donald Trump , shows that a faction of the GOP appears to be at ease with white nationalists in its ranks. At the Moore campaign rally Monday he attended,<e5><ca>Moore<U+0089><U+06EA>s wife defended her husband from accusations of anti-Semitism by saying that one of his attorneys is a Jew. (An investigation by The Forward failed to find this Jewish lawyer.) It also shows that Steve Bannon<U+0089><U+06EA>s effort to publicly distance himself from the alt-right is a ruse.<e5><ca>Bannon, the Breitbart News executive chairman and a former White House chief strategist, had championed Moore and is backing Nehlen. Nehlen told HuffPost that Bannon is a <U+0089><db><cf>friend.<U+0089><U+06DD> On the <U+0089><db><cf>Fash the Nation<U+0089><U+06DD> podcast, Nehlen said Bannon considers him a <U+0089><db><cf>kamikaze<U+0089><U+06DD> against the GOP establishment. Bannon did not respond to a request for comment on Nehlen<U+0089><U+06EA>s white nationalist sentiments.<e5><ca>Neither did the Moore campaign.<e5><ca>Nor did the National Republican Congressional Committee. Nehlen has been comfortable expressing bigoted comments in public for a while now, as documented by the Angry White Men blog run by Twitter user @EyesOnTheRight. Earlier this month, during a Twitter spat with Richard Lawler, an editor at tech news site Engadget who is black, Nehlen tweeted, <U+0089><db><cf>Run along Tyrone.<U+0089><U+06DD> As @EyesOnTheRight wrote, <U+0089><db><cf>There are two ways to interpret that comment, both of which suggest Nehlen was making a racist remark.

Grassley, who serves on the Finance Committee, made the remark when asked about the Senate tax reform measure which would double the exemption for estates to $11 million for an individual and $22 million for a couple. Heirs would inherit the estates tax-free. Grassley<U+0089><U+06EA>s comment triggered a wave of criticism on social media.<e5><ca>Many complained that the working class is, in fact, spending <U+0089><db><cf>every darn penny<U+0089><U+06DD> on raising their kids, caring for elderly parents, health care and putting food on the table.

Grassley has long argued that estate taxes, which currently must be paid on individual estates worth more than $5.5 million ($11 million for a married couple), hurt farms and small businesses in the state. Now, the Iowa senator apparently sees the tax change as a way to reward those who have accumulated millions of dollars by <U+0089><db><cf>investing.<U+0089><U+06DD> The newspaper found that the estate tax break will affect only <U+0089><db><cf>dozens<U+0089><U+06DD><e5><ca>among 1.4 million Iowa taxpayers, according to IRS data ,<e5><ca>because almost all estates fall under the current exemption cap. The newspaper noted that the number of Iowans owing estate taxes was just 32 of 1.4 million taxpayers in 2012 <U+0089><db><d3> or .002 percent of the total. Sixty-one people <U+0089><db><d3> .004 percent of all Iowa taxpayers<e5><U+0289><db><d3> filed estate taxes in 2015.

According to Corcoran and his then-editor, Joe Bargmann, the quote was altered in the article by the magazine<U+0089><U+06EA>s editor-in-chief, who swapped the word <U+0089><db><cf>pussy<U+0089><U+06DD> for the rather more innocuous <U+0089><db><cf>talent.<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><cf>I was asked to change the last word of the story from <U+0089><db><f7>pussy.<U+0089><U+06EA> When I refused, my top editor changed the quote,<U+0089><U+06DD> Bargmann said.

Trump has been accused by at least 16 women of sexual harassment and assault . Among them, Jill Harth said Trump sexually assaulted her in his daughter Ivanka<U+0089><U+06EA>s bedroom in 1993; Jessica Leeds said Trump <U+0089><db><cf>grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt<U+0089><U+06DD> on an airplane in the 1970s; and Rachel Crooks, then a 22-year-old receptionist in Trump Tower, said Trump kissed her <U+0089><db><cf>directly on the mouth<U+0089><U+06DD> at their first meeting in 2005. The White House has said that all 16 women are lying . As sexual harassment and assault allegations against powerful men in Hollywood, the media and elsewhere continue to dominate the news cycle, Trump has not minced words in condemning the behavior of men like Franken (D-Minn.) and former President Bill Clinton . Wednesday he called out NBC anchor Matt Lauer after he was fired over sexual misconduct allegations.

She also said she wasn<U+0089><U+06EA>t offended. <U+0089><db><cf>I thought, <U+0089><db><f7>This is interesting.<U+0089><U+06EA><U+0089><U+06DD> It should be noted that this was her expression on the show when she said that: Huddy said she was surprised he went for her lips but <U+0089><db><cf>didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t feel threatened.<U+0089><U+06DD> In fact, she brought a friend back to Trump Tower so that the future president could give them a tour of <U+0089><db><cf>The Apprentice<U+0089><U+06DD> set. Huddy believes Trump was single at the time, and, after checking the math, host Bill Schulz said it was possible he wasn<U+0089><U+06EA>t engaged to Melania Trump at the time of the kiss. She says Trump referenced the kiss when he was Huddy<U+0089><U+06EA>s guest on her syndicated series, <U+0089><db><cf>The Morning Show With Mike and Juliet.<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><cf>He came up on stage and he turned around to the audience <U+0089><U+06E5> and, you know, there were 50 people there <U+0089><U+06E5> and he said, <U+0089><db><f7>I tried to hit on her, but she blew me off,<U+0089><U+06EA><U+0089><U+06DD> Huddy remembered. Huddy emphasized that at the time she wasn<U+0089><U+06EA>t offended that he kissed her but that she has a different perspective now. <U+0089><db><cf>Now that I<U+0089><U+06EA>ve matured, I would<U+0089><U+06EA>ve said, <U+0089><db><f7>Nope.<U+0089><U+06EA> At that time, I was making excuses.<U+0089><U+06DD> HuffPost reached out to the White House for comment, but it did not immediately respond.

122,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-impeachment-donald-trump_us_5a28616be4b03ece02ffedd1","WASHINGTON <U+0089><U+06E5> Fifty-eight House Democrats voted to advance the impeachment of President Donald Trump on Wednesday, in direct defiance of the pleas of House Democratic leaders earlier in the day. A vote to table the impeachment resolution was agreed to 368-58, with four Democrats voting just <U+0089><db><cf>present<U+0089><U+06DD> and 126 other Democrats voting with Republicans to kill the resolution. It may seem like this was an overwhelming confirmation of Trump <U+0089><U+06E5> and it was, in the sense that no Republican voted to advance impeachment and more than two-thirds of Democrats joined their GOP colleagues <U+0089><U+06E5> but 58 Democratic votes is still a significant statement on impeachment.  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) issued a joint statement just before the vote urging their Democratic colleagues to reject the impeachment resolution. They presented the vote as a distraction from efforts to kill the Republican tax bill, which is swiftly making its way through Congress, and they cited the special counsel<U+0089><U+06EA>s investigation of Trump, as well as inquiries from congressional committees, to plead with Democrats to hold off. <U+0089><db><cf>Now is not the time,<U+0089><U+06DD> Pelosi and Hoyer wrote. But the most progressive wing of the Democratic caucus, bolstered by a large number of Congressional Black Caucus members <U+0089><U+06E5> including the No. 3 Democrat, Assistant Democratic Leader Jim Clyburn (S.C.) <U+0089><U+06E5> ignored Pelosi and Hoyer and voted for impeachment. The resolution was introduced by CBC member Al Green (D-Texas), who was talked out of forcing an impeachment vote earlier in the year. Green, wearing an American flag tie, said his resolution wasn<U+0089><U+06EA>t about Democrats or Republicans; it was about democracy, about <U+0089><db><cf>the fate of our republic.<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><cf>May everyone vote their conscience knowing that history will judge us all,<U+0089><U+06DD> Green said. Rather than attacking Trump over issues like Russia, Green<U+0089><U+06EA>s impeachment resolution hits Trump for race-baiting, bigotry, anti-Semitism, and a number of Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s comments, including his statements after the protests in Charlottesville, Virginia; comments against the governor of Puerto Rico; and even Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s crusade against NFL protests. By not bringing Russia into the matter, the resolution may just be a proxy for the general anger toward Trump in the Democratic base, and Green may have had an easier time arguing to his colleagues that his resolution should proceed. Despite Pelosi and Hoyer<U+0089><U+06EA>s concerns that the impeachment resolution would simply become a cudgel to divide Democrats, the vote will likely help some Democratic members, particularly those in far-left districts. But the vote might not be without consequences. Unabashed liberal Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colo.) and more moderate Rep. Tim Walz (D-Minn.),<e5><ca>who are both running for governor of their respective states, also voted to advance the impeachment process. Still, Green argued that civility from Democrats had prevented them from confronting Trump for too long. <U+0089><db><cf>In doing this, hatred disguised as acceptable political correctness has festered in our body politic and polluted our discourse to our detriment. It divides and damages the social fabric of our country in ways that obstruction of justice cannot.

124,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/leandra-english-gop-boogeyman_us_5a2724dfe4b0c2117626a246","Over the past two weeks, conservative media has been warning of a new menace loose in the corridors of Washington, a <U+0089><db><cf> rogue <U+0089><U+06DD> agent <U+0089><db><cf> burrowing <U+0089><U+06DD> into the federal bureaucracy to mount a <U+0089><db><cf> coup <U+0089><U+06DD> that could shatter the rule of law and shred the Constitution in a deranged bid for unaccountable power. It<U+0089><U+06EA>s the type of conspiracy theory popular in Facebook groups and Reddit forums that cater to fringe paranoia. But in this case, these ominous concerns are coming from Republican senators. They<U+0089><U+06EA>re the latest salvo in a quixotic, yearslong battle the GOP has waged against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an agency Congress created in 2010 to streamline federal oversight of abusive banking practices. And the main target of this impassioned vitriol is a 34-year-old bureaucrat named Leandra English. English, according to interviews with several former colleagues, is, well <U+0089><U+06E5> she<U+0089><U+06EA>s boring. Not dull. Plenty of people commended her energy and intellect. But someone who specializes in work that doesn<U+0089><U+06EA>t demand a spotlight.<e5><ca>After earning a master<U+0089><U+06EA>s degree from the London School of Economics, she<U+0089><U+06EA>s built a career as a Washington functionary, changing federal agencies every few years as new opportunities arose, distinguishing herself by working long hours and, as multiple people said, <U+0089><db><cf>keeping the trains running on time.<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><cf>At the bureau, she was known as somebody with no ego,<U+0089><U+06DD> notes Patricia McCoy, former CFPB assistant director for mortgage markets. <U+0089><db><cf>Her talent in cutting through red tape was widely recognized.<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><cf>She worked later than probably anybody I know,<U+0089><U+06DD> says Chris Vaeth, who spent five years at the CFPB, ultimately leading its Office of Community Affairs. English declined to comment for this story. The bulk of that work took place at the CFPB, where English started in 2010 and returned after separate stints at the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management. She worked on the transition team that put the nascent agency on its feet. As deputy director for external affairs, she was charged with such radical activities as outreach to community banks and the establishment of a consumer complaint system. She<U+0089><U+06EA>s been deputy chief operations officer and deputy chief of staff. Prior to the election last year, she applied for a job as the bureau<U+0089><U+06EA>s chief of staff, which she started in January. And she<U+0089><U+06EA>s effective. The consumer complaint system works. Even bank lobbyists pressing for lighter regulation acknowledge some grudging admiration. <U+0089><db><cf>I like Leandra,<U+0089><U+06DD> Consumer Bankers Association CEO Richard Hunt told American Banker. <U+0089><db><cf>I think she was a terrific chief of staff.<U+0089><U+06DD> Then, on Nov. 24, English took a career risk that landed her name in the papers. When CFPB Director Richard Cordray resigned to run for office in Ohio, he named English deputy director.<e5><ca>English accepted the nod, knowing it was a politically controversial appointment <U+0089><U+06E5> a deliberate attempt to prevent President Donald Trump from installing a loyalist hostile to the agency<U+0089><U+06EA>s mission without at least going through the Senate confirmation process. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the 2010 law that established the agency, the deputy director becomes acting director whenever the director himself is <U+0089><db><cf>absent or unavailable.<U+0089><U+06DD> English was, she believed, now in charge of the agency she had helped found. But the president was apparently unhappy with this reasoning. Over Thanksgiving weekend, he named his budget director, Mick Mulvaney , acting head of the CFPB. English sued , and the question of who is actually running the agency is now making its way through federal court. Mulvaney is ideologically hostile to the bureau. He once called it a <U+0089><db><cf>sick, sad<U+0089><U+06DD> joke . At a news conference last Monday, he declared that it had been <U+0089><db><cf>trampling on capitalism.<U+0089><U+06DD> This is rather feverish rhetoric to describe an agency that essentially guards against petty theft. Over the past six years, the CFPB has returned roughly $12 billion in ill-gotten gains from financial institutions to over 29 million consumers. For individual families, that can mean substantive relief <U+0089><U+06E5> hundreds, and in some cases, thousands of dollars over bogus charges or deceptive contracts. But it<U+0089><U+06EA>s hardly a threat to American capitalism, which has grown from a $16 trillion annual enterprise the day the CFPB opened its doors to an over $17 trillion operation today. The agency<U+0089><U+06EA>s most recent major enforcement action was a $100 million fine imposed against Wells Fargo for secretly creating millions of bank accounts for customers who had never asked for them. In Mulvaney<U+0089><U+06EA>s installation, CFPB<U+0089><U+06EA>s leadership saw an effort from the Trump administration to dismantle an organization they had constructed from scratch. English and her supporters are perfectly aware they may well lose their case. An early court ruling has already come down in Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s favor, and the CFPB<U+0089><U+06EA>s own general counsel has issued a memo siding with Mulvaney, who says he would keep English as deputy director if he ultimately prevails . If Trump were simply better organized, he could sidestep the entire affair by just naming a full-time director and getting him or her confirmed by the Senate. But it<U+0089><U+06EA>s hard to build things in Washington that genuinely work, and very easy to destroy them. To English and her allies, even a long-shot bid to postpone or mitigate the damage is better than a full surrender. That<U+0089><U+06EA>s the not-so-secret reason Republicans expend so much venom on the CFPB. Though plenty of the CFPB<U+0089><U+06EA>s enemies in the GOP have accepted robust campaign contributions from the financial sector, the agency poses a much more serious threat to conservative ideology than it does to any donor<U+0089><U+06EA>s bottom line. The financial industry has been booking handsome profits throughout the CFPB<U+0089><U+06EA>s existence <U+0089><U+06E5> the $12 billion it has had to give back didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t put an end to big bonuses, or force any legitimate businesses to close up shop. The CFPB instead serves as a constant institutional reminder that government can <U+0089><U+06E5> if it relies on the right people <U+0089><U+06E5> actually get things done. And so the Republican attacks on English don<U+0089><U+06EA>t accuse her of waste or incompetence or any of the other stock conservative objections to bureaucracy. They have instead portrayed her as a dangerous mastermind. <U+0089><db><cf>This rogue employee is trying to ... run the agency as an unaccountable fourth branch of government,<U+0089><U+06DD> wrote nine GOP senators, including Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in a letter to Mulvaney. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), meanwhile, penned a lengthy conspiratorial inquiry to Kathleen McGettigan, acting director of the Office of Personnel Management, accusing English of <U+0089><db><cf>burrowing<U+0089><U+06DD> into the CFPB for political purposes. Johnson wanted to know whether English had <U+0089><db><cf>abused<U+0089><U+06DD> the hiring process by securing the chief of staff job in January. The criticism has outraged English<U+0089><U+06EA>s former colleagues. <U+0089><db><cf>As somebody who saw her work and values her highly, I<U+0089><U+06EA>m just really offended at the attempt to portray her as some kind of venal, spotlight-grabbing carpetbagger,<U+0089><U+06DD> says Holly Petraeus, a former assistant director at the CFPB who retired this year. <U+0089><db><cf>She<U+0089><U+06EA>s not that at all.<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><cf>The things they<U+0089><U+06EA>re saying are so ridiculous. They just say the absolute opposite of what is true,<U+0089><U+06DD> says Elizabeth Vale, who served as director of external affairs for the CFPB. <U+0089><db><cf>She could have gone and made a lot of money somewhere. She is a true, dedicated public servant who wants to make a real difference in this world ... if you asked me to put the people I admire most as public servants on that list, she would be in the top five.<U+0089><U+06DD> Vale, who also worked with former senior adviser Valerie Jarrett in the Obama White House, now teaches at the University of Pennsylvania. That is the ultimate tragedy of the CFPB. Eventually, English will lose, one way or another. Trump or Vice President Mike Pence or someone else will get around to naming a full-time director and for a few months or maybe even a couple of years, devoted public servants will try to hang on. But capable people like English will only stick around for so long in a place where the top brass is determined to prevent them from actually accomplishing anything. They<U+0089><U+06EA>ll accept other job offers, finding a different quiet,<e5><ca>thankless way to contribute to society. The CFPB will decay into just another dysfunctional Washington paper-mill and banks will become steadily more shameless in their reliance on predatory practices. Not because it is inevitable, but because a handful of people in power will decide it should be so.",1,52.39,10.6,12.9,1388,74,"Meet Leandra English, The GOP's Latest Boogeyman",2017-12-06 05:53:00,"Zach Carter","Politics","@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_gad,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_enterprise_politics,consumer-financial-protection-bureau,consumer-protection,financial-reform,leandra-english,republican-party,type: news,us-news",408177,45955,408177,61322,7367,33777,1.092,1.056,1.416,1.517,389183,14072,4922,1927,26246,2283,363000,4789,3068,1580,139,2,954,744,21,186,3,"Meet Leandra English, The GOP's Latest Boogeyman",2017-12-06 05:53:00,"Zach Carter","Politics","@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_gad,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_enterprise_politics,consumer-financial-protection-bureau,consumer-protection,financial-reform,leandra-english,republican-party,type: news,us-news",408177,45955,408177,61322,7367,33777,1.092,1.056,1.416,1.517,389183,14072,4922,1927,26246,2283,363000,4789,3068,1580,139,2,954,744,21,186,3

According to Pew, Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s approval rating among white evangelical Protestants dropped 17 percentage points from February to December, down from 78 percent to 61 percent. Eighty-one percent of white evangelical voters backed Trump in the 2016 presidential election, NPR reported . Though the decline was not as steep, Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s approval rating also dropped among adults 50 and older (from 47 percent to 38 percent) as well as among whites (49 percent to 41 percent). As Axios noted, Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s approval rating had either remained the same or dropped among every demographic group Pew polled. The survey was conducted Nov. 29 to Dec. 4 among 1,503 participants nationwide, a period during which Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. According to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll taken in the wake of Flynn<U+0089><U+06EA>s plea, half of Americans thought the ties between Russia and Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s team were a legitimate issue.

Trump on Saturday took aim at FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, the second highest ranking official at the bureau who has received many political jabs from the Republican Party in recent years. McCabe faced more than 16 hours of questioning this week from several House committees about his role in the FBI<U+0089><U+06EA>s investigations into Russia<U+0089><U+06EA>s election meddling and Hillary Clinton<U+0089><U+06EA>s private email server, according to CNN. <U+0089><db><cf>How can [McCabe], the man in charge, along with leakin<U+0089><U+06EA> James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife<U+0089><U+06EA>s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation,<U+0089><U+06DD><e5><ca>the president tweeted Saturday. Trump also pointed out that McCabe may be retiring soon, as The Washington Post reported Saturday. Early Sunday morning,<e5><ca>he referenced a Fox News segment that reported that McCabe allegedly used <U+0089><db><cf>his FBI Official Email Account to promote<e5><ca>[Hillary Clinton<U+0089><U+06EA>s] campaign.<U+0089><U+06DD> Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s tweets were an apparent attempt to undermine McCabe<U+0089><U+06EA>s credibility in the wake of reports that FBI agent Peter Strzok had sent texts considered politically biased against Trump. Strzok had mentioned <U+0089><db><cf>Andy,<U+0089><U+06DD> which could be a reference to McCabe, in an August 2016 text message to FBI attorney Lisa Page. Some Republicans believe the text messages show a conspiracy to take down Trump , possibly involving McCabe, according to the Post. Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s tweets also rehashed an alleged controversy surrounding 2016 campaign donations made by Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, an ally of Hillary and Bill Clinton, to McCabe<U+0089><U+06EA>s wife, who was running for (and eventually lost) a seat in Virginia<U+0089><U+06EA>s Senate. Many Republicans found the donations suspicious and used it to draw ties between the Clintons and McCabe, who oversaw the FBI<U+0089><U+06EA>s Clinton email probe. They then called for McCabe<U+0089><U+06EA>s firing. McCabe had alerted a department ethics official when the donations were made, according to the Washington Post. Later Saturday, Trump shifted his attention to reports that FBI general counsel James Baker was being reassigned. According to the Post, which first reported the news, Baker<U+0089><U+06EA>s reassignment was FBI director Christopher A. Wray<U+0089><U+06EA>s attempt to assemble a new team of senior advisers while fending off GOP claims of political bias within the FBI. The president<U+0089><U+06EA>s tweets echo the chorus of Republicans on Capitol Hill who have ramped up their criticism of the Department of Justice<U+0089><U+06EA>s investigation into ties between Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s campaign and Russia. Democrats have denounced the Republican attacks on the FBI and Justice Department, claiming they are attempts from the right to interfere with Special Counsel Robert Mueller<U+0089><U+06EA>s probe.

Michael Flynn was charged with one count of making a false statement to FBI agents and appeared in federal court in D.C. In a criminal information filing from Mueller<U+0089><U+06EA>s team, the government alleges that Flynn <U+0089><db><cf>willfully and knowingly made materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statements<U+0089><U+06DD> in an interview with FBI agents on Jan. 24. It alleges he falsely told the FBI that he did not ask the Russian ambassador to refrain from retaliating to sanctions the Obama administration imposed on Russia in late December. Flynn also allegedly lied about asking the Russian ambassador on Dec. 22 to delay or defeat a pending United Nations Security Council resolution. Considering all of the additional charges Flynn could have faced in connection with his overseas dealings, the fact that he is facing only one charge is an indication that Flynn is offering significant cooperation and information that could further Mueller<U+0089><U+06EA>s investigation. The Associated Press and Washington Post reported Friday that Flynn admitted in his plea that he spoke to the Russians at the direction of Trump transition team officials . In response to Friday morning<U+0089><U+06EA>s charge, Trump lawyer John Dowd told Wall Street Journal reporter Rebecca Ballhaus : <U+0089><db><cf>I have no reaction. I don<U+0089><U+06EA>t know enough. I<U+0089><U+06EA>m not worried about it.<U+0089><U+06DD> White House lawyer Ty Cobb said the plea implicates only Flynn. <U+0089><db><cf>The false statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year,<U+0089><U+06DD> Cobb said in a statement. <U+0089><db><cf>Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn. The conclusion of this phase of the Special Counsel<U+0089><U+06EA>s work demonstrates again that the Special Counsel is moving with all deliberate speed and clears the way for a prompt and reasonable conclusion.<U+0089><U+06DD> The New York Times reported in late November that Flynn<U+0089><U+06EA>s lawyer, Robert Kelner, was no longer sharing information with Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s legal team , further raising the possibility that Flynn was cooperating with Mueller<U+0089><U+06EA>s probe. Kelner later met with the investigators , according to ABC News. Flynn<U+0089><U+06EA>s indictment follows Mueller<U+0089><U+06EA>s team charging Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his former aide Rick Gates with 12 counts, including allegations of conspiracy against the U.S. and money laundering. Manafort and Gates pleaded not guilty to the charges and are scheduled to face a federal trial in May. In October, the investigators also reached a plea agreement with former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos , who lied to the FBI about being offered <U+0089><db><cf>dirt<U+0089><U+06DD> on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election.<e5><ca>Papadopoulos also reportedly suggested a meeting between then-candidate Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin last year. But those indictments involved only Trump campaign officials. Flynn is the first former administration official to be charged, making it more difficult for the White House to distance the president from Mueller<U+0089><U+06EA>s probe. After Trump fired then-FBI Director James Comey amid his investigation into the campaign, Comey testified that Trump had requested that he end the FBI<U+0089><U+06EA>s investigation into Flynn . Flynn, who stepped down as Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s national security adviser in February after lying to administration officials about the extent of his communications with Russian officials, had long faced scrutiny from the multiple investigations into Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s campaign . Of particular interest was Flynn<U+0089><U+06EA>s history of suspicious business dealings and financial ties to Russia, as well as his concealing that he worked as a foreign lobbyist for the Turkish government while advising Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s campaign. In the fall of 2016,<e5><ca>a businessman with close ties to Turkey<U+0089><U+06EA>s autocratic President Recep Tayyip Erdogan paid Flynn more than $500,000 to conduct research aimed at discrediting the exiled cleric Fethullah G<cc>_len.<e5><ca>Flynn failed to disclose the work until March ,<e5><ca>after he had already stepped down as national security adviser. Mueller<U+0089><U+06EA>s team has reportedly investigated Flynn<U+0089><U+06EA>s lobbying firm and its dealings with Turkey. Flynn also hid multiple contacts with Russia during Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s transition, including discussing sanctions with then-Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. He also attended a meeting with Kislyak to discuss creating a backchannel with Putin . Also in attendance was Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who is now a senior White House adviser and also reportedly a subject of Mueller<U+0089><U+06EA>s probe. White House officials have repeatedly denied any collusion between Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s team and Russia, often by downplaying suspected officials<U+0089><U+06EA><e5><ca>involvement in the campaign or the administration. In March, then-press secretary Sean Spicer diminished Flynn as just <U+0089><db><cf>a volunteer.<U+0089><U+06DD> Alana Horowitz Satlin contributed reporting.

137,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-passes-tax-bill_us_5a21da79e4b0a02abe91412e","WASHINGTON <U+0089><U+06E5> When Donald Trump was elected president last year, a sweeping rewrite of the tax code was one of his top priorities. Throughout the campaign, Trump said he wanted a <U+0089><db><cf>middle-class tax cut,<U+0089><U+06DD> one that wouldn<U+0089><U+06EA>t benefit wealthy people like him and would spur huge levels of economic growth while not adding to the national debt. <U+0089><db><cf>For the hedge fund guys, they<U+0089><U+06EA>re going to be paying up,<U+0089><U+06DD> Trump promised in September 2015 . As president, Trump has continued to insist the tax code overhaul won<U+0089><U+06EA>t be good for himself or other millionaires. <U+0089><db><cf>This is going to cost me a fortune, this thing <U+0089><U+06E5> believe me,<U+0089><U+06DD> Trump said this week . But the big winners in the GOP bill that the Senate passed early Saturday morning are corporations and the wealthy. Trump himself <U+0089><U+06E5> a self-proclaimed billionaire <U+0089><U+06E5> stands to gain millions through the elimination of certain taxes (though we don<U+0089><U+06EA>t know exactly how much because Trump won<U+0089><U+06EA>t release his tax returns). Far from being a middle-class tax cut, the measure is a massive corporate giveaway, a bill that recycles decades of Republican ideology on trickle-down economics and trusts that executives will hand over their new gains to average-income workers. <U+0089><db><cf>If my friends here want to give a tax cut to the middle class,<U+0089><U+06DD> Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) asked on the Senate floor Thursday, <U+0089><db><cf>why don<U+0089><U+06EA>t we give a tax cut to the middle class?<U+0089><U+06DD> His argument had no effect. After months of negotiations, the Senate passed the proposal, 51-49, with just one Republican <U+0089><U+06E5> Bob Corker of Tennessee <U+0089><U+06E5> joining all Democrats in opposition. Corker took issue with how much debt the bill would produce, and after the Senate parliamentarian struck down Corker<U+0089><U+06EA>s debt-control proposal , GOP leaders invited the retiring Republican to just vote no rather than finding him an accommodation. With the bill finally through the Senate <U+0089><U+06E5> the House passed its tax bill two weeks earlier <U+0089><U+06E5> the two chambers still have to work out their legislative differences in a conference committee before the tax rewrite becomes law. There<U+0089><U+06EA>s a slim chance the House could adopt the Senate bill and send it to the president<U+0089><U+06EA>s desk, but it<U+0089><U+06EA>s more likely that negotiators will merge the two versions. Both chambers need to pass the same measure for the bill to become law. For most Americans, the legislation is still indeed <U+0089><U+06E5> at least in the short term <U+0089><U+06E5> a tax cut. Those cuts are due in large part to Republicans approving $1.5 trillion in added debt over the next 10 years. But of that pie, the wealthy disproportionately benefit, and some households could wind up with higher tax bills. The richest 20 percent of households reap 90 percent of the benefit of the tax cuts over that time period, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center . Still, in the short term, it<U+0089><U+06EA>s difficult to say exactly whose taxes go up and whose go down. Tax burdens depend on what deductions individual filers claim, and this bill is a complicated tax code rewrite <U+0089><U+06E5> one that analysts say will have limited impact on the economy, will cost the nation more than a trillion dollars over the next 10 years, and will do much more for rich investors than it will the middle class. Despite all that, despite poll after poll showing the measure is unpopular , most Republicans were ecstatic to pass the bill. While the bill took months to draft, the final package came together over a frenetic last few days . Republicans didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t even have finished legislative text until Friday night, hours before the vote, and Democrats slammed their GOP colleagues for rushing through a bill that was cobbled together with handwritten changes and crossed-out pages at the last minute. Those procedural concerns did nothing to slow the bill, however, with Republicans falling in line to vote down a Democratic motion to adjourn Friday night. Senators then began a so-called vote-a-rama,<e5><ca>in which amendments get up-or-down approval one after the other until lawmakers are exhausted enough to stop. Eventually, in the early hours of Saturday morning, senators moved to a final vote on the reconciliation bill, and it passed. To get the bill over the 50-vote threshold for reconciliation legislation, GOP leaders cut deals this week on how much certain businesses could deduct off the top of their tax bills, as well as on what would be included in an upcoming government funding measure. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), for example, demanded that year-end spending legislation include funding for Obamacare subsidies that the Trump administration has targeted. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said he got assurances on a contentious immigration program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, though Trump administration officials said Flake only got assurances on being part of the conversation. Overall, the legislation would cut the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent, which has been the GOP<U+0089><U+06EA>s priority all along. Republicans say this dramatic reduction will unleash the economy and raise wages by making big businesses more internationally competitive <U+0089><U+06E5> claims that are dubious according to corporate executives themselves, who say they will throw the money at shareholders instead of workers. In addition to reducing corporate and individual tax rates across the board, the bill would simplify the tax code by getting rid of most deductions, which businesses and individuals use to reduce the amount of their income subject to taxation. Because Congress over the years has added write-offs in order to encourage and subsidize certain endeavors <U+0089><U+06E5> such as homeownership and higher education <U+0089><U+06E5> the mass elimination of these tax preferences could have wide-ranging effects that are incidental to the overall Republican goal of encouraging business investment. Axing deductions for state and local taxes, for instance, while increasing the value of a fixed <U+0089><db><cf>standard deduction,<U+0089><U+06DD> would result in far fewer households finding it worthwhile to deduct the amount they spend on mortgage interest. A study commissioned by the National Association of Realtors earlier this year said the proposal would reduce home values by 10 percent (which could be a good thing for people who don<U+0089><U+06EA>t already own homes). Republicans have long championed homeownership but have been undeterred by a lobbying blitz from the real estate industry. While fewer deductions makes for a simpler tax code, the bill would also create a complicated new deduction for certain businesses that aren<U+0089><U+06EA>t taxed as corporations. Determining which firms have the kind of <U+0089><db><cf>qualified business income<U+0089><U+06DD> eligible for the deduction will require many pages of new IRS regulation, though the bill explicitly excludes high-income service providers like accountants, lawyers and investment managers. In the day before the final vote, Republicans increased the value of the deduction to win over Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Steve Daines (R-Mont.), both of whom had previously withheld support because they felt the legislation disproportionately benefited firms that pay the corporate tax. And in a catchall <U+0089><db><cf> manager<U+0089><U+06EA>s amendment <U+0089><U+06DD> adopted just before the bill passed, Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) added a provision to allow publicly traded partnerships to claim the new deduction. Victor Fleischer, a tax professor at the University of San Diego School of law, said t hat the Cornyn amendment would specifically benefit oil and gas companies. <U+0089><db><cf>We should all re-read <U+0089><db><f7>Why Nations Fail<U+0089><U+06EA> after this tax bill passes,<U+0089><U+06DD> Fleischer said on Twitter . Another provision in the manager<U+0089><U+06EA>s amendment, inserted by Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), would have exempted schools that don<U+0089><U+06EA>t take federal funds, such as the conservative Hillsdale College in Michigan, from a new tax on college and university endowments. The tax seems designed less to raise money than to poke educated liberals in the eye. Several Republicans joined Democrats in defeating the amendment. Toomey<U+0089><U+06EA>s office did not respond to a request for comment. To keep the cost of the bill beneath $1.5 trillion <U+0089><U+06E5> an arbitrary level Republicans set for themselves in a budget process earlier this year <U+0089><U+06E5> almost all of the tax cuts for individuals expire at the end of 2025. Republicans say that expiration won<U+0089><U+06EA>t happen, noting that even President Barack Obama made nearly all of the Bush tax cuts permanent when they were up for reauthorization. But for all the GOP bluster about this bill being a tax cut for the middle class, and for all the rhetoric about the false necessity of making tax cuts permanent, the bill would keep the corporate tax rates the same while putting the individual rates up for expiration. Because of those temporary cuts, the Joint Committee on Taxation, which scores tax legislation for Congress, found that most households earning less than $75,000 annually would pay higher taxes 10 years from now. Just before debate began Friday night, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said on the Senate floor that this day would be remembered as one of the <U+0089><db><cf>great robberies in U.S. history.<U+0089><U+06DD> CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported that Toomey<U+0089><U+06EA>s Hillsdale carveout had been adopted.

But they skipped a planned rally in Murfreesboro after being delayed by security in Shelbyville and hearing that nearly 1,000 counter-protesters awaited them .

He blamed <U+0089><db><cf>the black gentleman<U+0089><U+06DD> for starting the confrontation. But video from the incident shows a large group of white men brawling and a woman, with blood dripping down her face, pushed against the window of the sports bar. Inside, some people started to record the fight on their phones, and the environment grew tense as bystanders argued about whether to intervene. <U+0089><db><cf>Do you want me to go out there and get beat up?

Jared Yates Sexton , a New York Times contributor and assistant professor of creative writing at Georgia Southern University, shared with HuffPost several threatening messages directed at him since he unmasked the troll Sunday. In one, a Reddit user warns of a looming <U+0089><db><cf>journocaust<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><d3> presumably a holocaust for journalists.

Less than an hour before, an Alabama judge rejected Moore<U+0089><U+06EA>s lawsuit attempting to delay certification of the results, saying that the court did not have the jurisdiction to rule in the case . According to The Associated Press , the suit was filed in Montgomery Circuit Court on Wednesday night, with Moore requesting that the state delay the certification of the election results, launch a fraud investigation and hold a new election.

During the contentious campaign, the former judge faced accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct from multiple women who claimed he preyed on them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. Moore, who was twice removed from the Alabama Supreme Court for failure to follow judicial orders, largely disappeared from the campaign trail in the days leading up to the election.

Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) announced that he did not vote for Moore . <U+0089><db><cf>I<U+0089><U+06EA>d rather see the Republican win, but I<U+0089><U+06EA>d rather see a Republican write-in,<U+0089><U+06DD> Shelby told CNN<U+0089><U+06EA>s Jake Tapper about the vote he cast two days before the special election. Jones,<e5><ca>a civil rights advocate and former prosecutor , ultimately won the race by about 20,000 votes. Following the stunning victory , Jones became Alabama<U+0089><U+06EA>s first Democratic senator in 25 years. In the complaint filed Wednesday, Moore<U+0089><U+06EA>s lawyers said they are certain voter fraud occurred, and that the only question is whether there was enough to sway the election. Moore<U+0089><U+06EA>s lawyers did not elaborate on exactly how they believe fraud occurred. The complaint repeatedly accuses Merrill of not doing enough to investigate voter fraud, but Merrill said Moore<U+0089><U+06EA>s campaign had not informed his office of specific allegations to investigate. Merrill said the first he heard about the allegations was late Wednesday evening, shortly before midnight . <U+0089><db><cf>I did read them. We take all allegations very seriously and we investigate all allegations that are introduced to us,<U+0089><U+06DD> Merrill said in a text message. <U+0089><db><cf>There<U+0089><U+06EA>s also a process for introducing them to us which requires that the complainant complete the form on www.stopvoterfraudnow.com .<U+0089><U+06DD> Moore<U+0089><U+06EA>s complaint cites a viral interview with a man the night of the election who indicated in an off-the-cuff comment that people from all over the country had come to vote and canvass for Jones in Alabama. After tracking down the man in the video and determining he was a registered voter in the state, Merrill declared the case was <U+0089><db><cf>nailed shut.<U+0089><U+06DD> Moore, however, says Merrill should have done more to investigate the claim. The suit also alleges that large numbers of out-of-state voters came to Alabama and illegally voted in the election. It includes a sworn affidavit from a poll worker saying she had never seen so many people vote with out-of-state driver<U+0089><U+06EA>s licenses. Alabama law permits people to vote with a state-issued ID from any state . As a supposed example of voter fraud, the complaint also cited an incident where sample ballots filled out for Jones were on display in a probate judge<U+0089><U+06EA>s office prior to the election. The ballots were removed after a complaint from Moore, and Merrill said he didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t believe the incident was a case of voter fraud . Moore also claimed there was Democratic <U+0089><db><cf>voter intimidation<U+0089><U+06DD> in the race, pointing to a super PAC ad that incorrectly told Alabamians their votes would be a matter of public record. Google removed the ad from the internet before the election after Merrill complained. Moore also took aim at the higher-than-expected turnout in Jefferson County, the state<U+0089><U+06EA>s most populous, saying it was <U+0089><db><cf>inexplicably substantially higher<U+0089><U+06DD> than places in other parts of the state. Moore implied it was suspicious that turnout in the race far exceeded what was projected. He also pointed to 20 precincts in Jefferson County where he received substantially less of the vote share than the Republican Party.

Also on Thursday, various outlets reported Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s longtime personal attorney and lead counsel on the Russia investigation, Marc Kasowitz, would be stepping into a smaller role . Kasowitz made headlines last week after he threatened a stranger in a string of profane emails, saying things like <U+0089><db><cf>watch your back, bitch,<U+0089><U+06DD> and <U+0089><db><cf>I<U+0089><U+06EA>m on you.<U+0089><U+06DD> Trump has reportedly been unhappy with some members of his legal team following a series of revelations involving his son Donald Trump Jr. HuffPost has reached out to Kasowitz for comment. Mark Corallo, the spokesman for Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s team of personal lawyers, resigned Thursday, the Post and Times reported. The New York Times also reported on the Trump team<U+0089><U+06EA>s inquiries, which it described as <U+0089><db><cf>wide-ranging,<U+0089><U+06DD> including <U+0089><db><cf>scrutinizing donations to Democratic candidates<U+0089><U+06DD> and looking into investigators<U+0089><U+06EA> former clients and Mueller<U+0089><U+06EA>s relationship with former FBI Director James Comey. Trump fired Comey in May while he was leading an investigation into whether Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s campaign colluded with Russia. Trump later admitted he was thinking about the Russia investigation when he decided to dismiss the FBI director. Among the potential conflicts of interest that Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s lawyers are looking at is an alleged dispute over membership fees between Mueller and Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s Virginia golf club, according to the Post.

Manafort is scheduled to testify before Congress on July 26 , as will the president<U+0089><U+06EA>s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. In a lengthy interview Wednesday in The New York Times, Trump said Mueller would be crossing a <U+0089><db><cf> red line <U+0089><U+06DD> if he looked into the Trump family<U+0089><U+06EA>s finances beyond any ties with Russia.

According to Roll Call, rumors of inappropriate behavior circulated before Franks<U+0089><U+06EA> announcement. The eight-term congressman is a social conservative and one of the most aggressive anti-abortion legislators in Congress. He has led the charge, year after year, to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy nationwide and to limit abortion in the District of Columbia. Residents of D.C. protested his efforts in 2012 by lining up outside the Arizona congressman<U+0089><U+06EA>s office with plastic rats and photos of pot holes, suggesting that he try to fix more pressing problems in the city than women having abortions. Franks also caused an uproar in 2013 when he claimed during an abortion debate that the <U+0089><db><cf>incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low,<U+0089><U+06DD> defending his bill<U+0089><U+06EA>s lack of an exception for rape and incest victims.

Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) asked a panel of Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s judicial nominees to indicate if they had never tried a case to verdict in a courtroom. Matthew Spencer Petersen, a nominee for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, raised his hand. Kennedy proceeded to press him on legal matters. KENNEDY: Have you ever tried a jury trial? PETERSEN: I have not. KENNEDY: Civil? PETERSEN: No. KENNEDY: Criminal? PETERSEN: No. KENNEDY: Bench? PETERSEN: No. KENNEDY: State or federal court? PETERSEN: I have not. It only got worse from there. Petersen, who is currently the chairman of the U.S. Federal Election Commission, struggled to answer more questions as it became clear he did not have the experience typically expected of a federal judge. KENNEDY: As a trial judge, you<U+0089><U+06EA>re obviously going to have witnesses. Can you tell me what the Daubert standard is? PETERSEN: Sen. Kennedy, I don<U+0089><U+06EA>t have that readily at my disposal but I would be happy to take a closer look at that. That is not something I<U+0089><U+06EA>ve had to contend with. KENNEDY: Do you know what a motion in limine is? PETERSEN: Yes.. I haven<U+0089><U+06EA>t, I<U+0089><U+06EA>m, again, my background is not in litigation as when I was replying to Chairman (Chuck) Grassley (R-Iowa), I haven<U+0089><U+06EA>t had to um, again, do a deep dive. Petersen then began ticking off his experience <U+0089><db><cf>in a decision-making role<U+0089><U+06DD> at the FEC. Kennedy interrupted him: KENNEDY: Yes, I<U+0089><U+06EA>ve read your resume. Just for the record, do you know what a motion in limine is? PETERSEN: I would probably not be able to give you a good definition right here at the table. KENNEDY: Do you know what the Younger abstention doctrine is? PETERSEN: Um, I<U+0089><U+06EA>ve heard of it...<e5><ca>but I, again. KENNEDY: How about the Pullman abstention doctrine ? PETERSEN: I... I heard... KENNEDY: Y<U+0089><U+06EA>all see that a lot in federal court. A number of Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s judicial nominees have come under fire for not being fit to serve on the federal bench. Four of his court picks have been rated <U+0089><db><cf>not qualified<U+0089><U+06DD> by the American Bar Association <U+0089><U+06E5> an embarrassingly high number to receive the abysmal rating in a president<U+0089><U+06EA>s first year. One of them, district court court nominee Brett Talley, withdrew his nomination this week. Part of the reason this keeps happening is that Trump is nominating judges at a breakneck pace without taking the time to thoroughly vet their backgrounds. That<U+0089><U+06EA>s leading to problems later in their confirmation process, as senators discover more details about their background. Many of Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s court picks are being funneled to him by the The Federalist Society, a right-wing legal organization focused on filling up courts with conservative judges. Kennedy is one of few Republicans critical of Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s judicial nominees, saying at one point the president is <U+0089><db><cf> getting some very, very bad advice .<U+0089><U+06DD> See Kennedy<U+0089><U+06EA>s full exchange with Petersen above.

They<U+0089><U+06EA>re trying to get everything they can, looting the store, taking everything off the shelves like it<U+0089><U+06EA>s the end times. The walls are closing in as the special counsel investigation continues unabated <U+0089><U+06E5> causing some in the GOP to to try to damage it <U+0089><U+06E5> and as the Resistance becomes supercharged, expanding the Democrats<U+0089><U+06EA> chances of making big wins in 2018. The GOP has even lost its last fig leaf of moderation<U+0089><U+06E5>Maine senator Susan Collins<U+0089><U+06E5>who<U+0089><U+06EA>s been having a meltdown in the past few days after being exposed in much of the media, having voted for the Trump tax scam and not received in return promised votes on shoring up Obamacare markets. (Now GOP leaders are telling her they will come in 2018 ...sure.) Collins, who voted for Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s most misogynistic judicial nominees, hostile to a woman<U+0089><U+06EA>s right to choose, has devolved into claiming she<U+0089><U+06EA>s now a victim of an <U+0089><db><cf>unbelievably sexist<U+0089><U+06DD> media, sounding every bit like what the alt-right would call a whiny snowflake. There<U+0089><U+06EA>s been much speculation about why Republicans would pass an enormously unpopular tax bill knowing that the narrative of a tax bill at the time of its passage usually doesn<U+0089><U+06EA>t change later, no matter what the reality turns out to be. Many have pointed to the White House and GOP leaders wanting a win of any kind, and needing to placate donors <U+0089><U+06E5> and even being honest about it <U+0089><U+06E5> taking a risk with voters. That<U+0089><U+06EA>s certainly true for some. Others have pointed to GOP senators, some of whom are leaving Congress, benefiting personally from the bill , the most notable example being Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee flipping his vote after additions to the bill benefited real estate investors like himself (He has adamantly denied this). I<U+0089><U+06EA>ve been saying for a while that much of the motivation, however, also seems to be desperation among many Republicans who see the handwriting on the wall. Between the Russia investigation and Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s plummeting approval, they know Trump will fall, or that they will soon lose control of the House and possibly the Senate <U+0089><U+06E5> or both. This would explain why even White House officials like Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and White House economic advisor Gary Cohn backed a plan that will hurt Trump with his base and will further his downfall: These Goldman Sachs alums, too, stand to benefit greatly from the tax bill , and they likely see that this might be the last thing they get before the Trump administration collapses. Cohn has certainly both criticized and mocked Trump enough behind his back (in addition to faking bad reception to hang up on Trump) for us to imagine he is not acting in Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s best political interests. Trump, too, is clearly freaking out about the Russia investigation and is desperately trying to cling to his base, no matter what the costs. The reckless announcement to r ecognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel , while it played well to several factions in Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s shrinking base, has caused reverberations around the world, forcing Mike Pence to cancel his trip to the Middle East , bringing a rebuke from the United Nations General Assembly and seriously raising tensions in a way that will come back to haunt Trump and the U.S. Banning transgender people from the military (though courts have put this on hold ) and the news reported last week that the Centers for Disease Control has been told by the Trump administration to ban in budget documents words and terms like <U+0089><db><cf>transgender,<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><cf>fetus<U+0089><U+06DD> and <U+0089><db><cf>science-based,<U+0089><U+06DD> plays to evangelicals <U+0089><U+06E5> whose support for Trump has dropped by 17 percent in a recent Pew poll <U+0089><U+06E5> but horrifies most Americans who can see signs of a turn toward fascism. But while Trump may believe these desperate moves will help him, the GOP in Congress knows that Trump can<U+0089><U+06EA>t win again by only playing to his decimated base. Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s 2016 win <U+0089><U+06E5> without the popular vote and with Russian interference and James Comey<U+0089><U+06EA>s recklessness <U+0089><U+06E5> was a fluke in which he won the Electoral College by less than 85,000 votes in three states ; his base has shrunk (and slowly keeps eroding) and nothing is bringing it back. By placating some aspects of the base <U+0089><U+06E5> like evangelicals <U+0089><U+06E5> with the aforementioned actions, he<U+0089><U+06EA>s actually scaring away others in the base, and GOP leaders see this. From Virginia to Alabama, they know the blue wave is building into a possible tsunami next fall. They will use every sleazy tactic at their disposal, from voter suppression and ID laws to looking the other way of more possible Russian interference , but it may not be enough to overcome the wave. That will be compounded by the corruption and misjudgments of some of the candidates that the GOP<U+0089><U+06EA>s base, often with the help of Steve Bannon and other extremists, will back in primaries <U+0089><U+06E5> as we saw in Virginia and Alabama. All of this means that, as horrifying and demoralizing as the current climate is, and as damaging as this tax scam will be for years to come, progressives and Democrats must stay committed and determined because of a very real shot at beating the crap out of the GOP at the ballot box in 2018. And Trump may be taken down, either before finishing his term or in 2020 (if he<U+0089><U+06EA>s not taken down by the GOP first in GOP presidential primaries). Undoing the catastrophic damage that Trump and the GOP have created since the start of the Trump presidency will take years. Some of it may be impossible to undo, something the GOP is banking on. But it seems pretty clear that if progressives stay energized and don<U+0089><U+06EA>t let up, Democrats will take back power. And it seems even more clear the GOP knows that.

Al Franken (D-Minn.) touched their butts in separate incidents. These are the third and fourth such allegations against Franken in the past week. Leeann Tweeden, a radio host, wrote last week that Franken had kissed and groped her without her consent during a 2006 USO tour. On Monday, Lindsay Menz accused Franken of groping her at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. The two additional women, who said they were not familiar with each others<U+0089><U+06EA> stories, both spoke on condition of anonymity. But their stories, which describe events during Franken<U+0089><U+06EA>s first campaign for the Senate, are remarkably similar <U+0089><db><d3> and both women have been telling them privately for years. In a statement to HuffPost, Franken said, <U+0089><db><cf>It<U+0089><U+06EA>s difficult to respond to anonymous accusers, and I don<U+0089><U+06EA>t remember those campaign events.<U+0089><U+06DD> The first woman, who spoke to HuffPost on condition of anonymity because she<U+0089><U+06EA>s worried she<U+0089><U+06EA>ll be harassed online for making the allegation, said Franken groped her when they posed for a photo after a June 25, 2007, event hosted by the Minnesota Women<U+0089><U+06EA>s Political Caucus in Minneapolis. <U+0089><db><cf>My story is eerily similar to Lindsay Menz<U+0089><U+06EA>s story ,<U+0089><U+06DD> the first woman said. <U+0089><db><cf>He grabbed my buttocks during a photo op.<U+0089><U+06DD> The second woman told HuffPost that Franken cupped her butt with his hand at a 2008 Democratic fundraiser in Minneapolis, then suggested the two visit the bathroom together.

After the ceremony, she and other members of the choir approached him for photos. <U+0089><db><cf>My mother loves Al Franken.

One fellow choir member, Sarah, remembers not only being there for the groping incident but hearing another choir member say that Franken wouldn<U+0089><U+06EA>t stop looking at her chest. Ten years ago, it was easier to shrug off predatory behavior as <U+0089><db><cf>boys being boys,<U+0089><U+06DD> Sarah said, especially when that predatory behavior came from a political ally. <U+0089><db><cf>At the time ... people weren<U+0089><U+06EA>t as willing to speak against people they felt like were on their side,<U+0089><U+06DD> Sarah said. <U+0089><db><cf>It<U+0089><U+06EA>s really disappointing.

I voted for him after this happened.<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><f7>I Was Completely Mortified<U+0089><U+06EA> The second woman, who said she was groped at a fundraiser, told HuffPost it took place in the fall of 2008 at the Loft Literary Center in Minneapolis. She was excited about attending the event and meeting someone she wanted to support. <U+0089><db><cf>I had never attended anything like that,<U+0089><U+06DD> she said. She and her friends found Franken and introduced themselves to him. <U+0089><db><cf>I shook his hand, and he put his arm around my waist and held it there,<U+0089><U+06DD> the second woman said. <U+0089><db><cf>Then he moved it lower and cupped my butt.<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><cf>I was completely mortified,<U+0089><U+06DD> she added. In order to escape the situation, the woman excused herself to go to the bathroom. At that point, she said, Franken leaned in and suggested that he accompany her. She grabbed her friend and fled to the bathroom without him. The second woman told several people <U+0089><U+06E5> including one of the reporters for this story, Zachary Roth <U+0089><U+06E5> about the incident some years ago, but didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t want it reported then. She said she didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t tell anyone at the time of the incident because inappropriate behavior from men was not that unusual to her or her friends. <U+0089><db><cf>Sexual harassment happens so often, you have to learn how to move on,<U+0089><U+06DD> she said, describing her thinking at the time. Several other factors also left her feeling powerless. <U+0089><db><cf>I felt like I didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t have a voice,<U+0089><U+06DD> she said. <U+0089><db><cf>This man had all of the power, all of the authority.

On June 14, 1923, or Flag Day, a federal code was put in place that would serve as a guideline for how to handle the American flag. A viral Twitter thread brought the almost century-old standards back into the spotlight on Saturday. There are several sections in the code about proper national anthem conduct, how to display the flag, and how to respect the flag in general . The code does state that everyone during the national anthem, <U+0089><db><cf>all present except those in uniform should stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart,<U+0089><U+06DD> but the guidelines are not legally binding<e5><U+0289><U+06E5> more like official suggestions about how to treat what the code calls <U+0089><db><cf>a living thing.<U+0089><U+06DD> Here are some things that Americans do on a regular basis that are considered disrespectful according to the Flag Code:  American flag clothing <U+0089><db><cf>The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery. It should never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds, but always allowed to fall free.<U+0089><U+06DD> That means every American flag swimsuit, button-up shirt, and even those famous Old Navy flag shirts, can be considered disrespectful.  The flag shouldn<U+0089><U+06EA>t be carried flat <U+0089><db><cf>The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.<U+0089><U+06DD> Most people know the flag should never touch the ground, but few know that it has to be displayed vertically.<e5><ca>Maybe it<U+0089><U+06EA>s a nod to the lyric that had the flag <U+0089><db><cf>gallantly streaming<U+0089><U+06DD> in the air. Whatever the case, an unfurled flag that sits flat is a disrespect to the Flag Code.  Drawing on the flag <U+0089><db><cf>The flag should never have placed upon it, nor on any part of it, nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature.<U+0089><U+06DD> This one seems pretty self-explanatory. Most people understand that drawing on the symbol of the country will probably be seen as disrespectful. But freedom of expression is a constitutionally protected right, so artists (and the rest of us) are still free to make that choice.  Disposable flag products <U+0089><db><cf>It should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions or handkerchiefs and the like, printed or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard.<U+0089><U+06DD> Sorry to put a damper on probably every Fourth of July cookout ever, but if the paper plate supporting that juicy burger has a flag on it, the Flag Code says that<U+0089><U+06EA>s disrespectful.  Flag advertisements <U+0089><db><cf>The flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever.<U+0089><U+06DD> If a business or company is using a flag in its advertisements, that<U+0089><U+06EA>s yet another disrespectful gesture. A flag printed on a disposable flier is probably a double offense.  Flag uniforms <U+0089><db><cf>No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform. However, a flag patch may be affixed to the uniform of military personnel, firemen, policemen, and members of patriotic organizations.<U+0089><U+06DD> It seems like sports teams are running afoul of the guidelines by putting the flag on uniforms.<e5><ca>The only way to respectfully wear the American flag on a costume is with a <U+0089><db><cf>patch<U+0089><U+06DD> on the side of the uniform for service members, firefighters and police officers, according to the code.

On Saturday night, Obama quoted former South African President Nelson Mandela in a series of tweets: The first of the bunch, in which Obama is smiling at children of different ethnicities, topped 2.8 million likes on Tuesday night. A tweet by Ariana Grande following the deadly bombing in May at the end of her concert in Manchester, England, previously held the top spot with 2.7 million likes. Obama tweeted the quote from Mandela<U+0089><U+06EA>s autobiography Long Walk to Freedom a few hours after James Alex Fields Jr., 20, plowed his car into marchers protesting the <U+0089><db><cf>Unite the Right<U+0089><U+06DD> rally attended by various white supremacist groups on Saturday, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer . Also killed that day were two on-duty Virginia state troopers whose helicopter crashed on the outskirts of Charlottesville. President Donald Trump responded to the clashes in Charlottesville in a very different way on Saturday, saying: <U+0089><db><cf>We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides <U+0089><U+06E5> on many sides,<U+0089><U+06DD> Trump said on national television. <U+0089><db><cf>It<U+0089><U+06EA>s been going on for a long time in our country, not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama. It<U+0089><U+06EA>s been going on for a long, long time.<U+0089><U+06DD> Trump also tweeted about the violence numerous times on Saturday. None of his tweets, however, specifically condemned any white supremacy extremist groups. Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s most popular tweet addressing the events in Charlottesville on Saturday had not gotten more than 190,000 likes as of Tuesday morning. The others didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t exceed 125,000 likes. Facing bipartisan criticism over his initial responses, Trump on Monday was more explicit in comments he made at the White House. <U+0089><db><cf>Racism is evil, and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, Neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to what we hold dear as Americans,<U+0089><U+06DD> he said.

To Jack Rosenthal, the hate-filled imagery was something he never thought he<U+0089><U+06EA>d see again, at least not in the United States. Rosenthal is one of 10,000 Romanian refugees who came to America after World War II. At 88 years old, he still mourns the loss of seven family members who died in the Auschwitz death camp. He was the only one to survive. He was born and raised in a farming village in northern Romania. <U+0089><db><cf>Altogether in my village, there were 26 Jewish families,<U+0089><U+06DD> Rosenthal told HuffPost. Most of them didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t survive either. Ultimately, hundreds of thousands of Romanian Jews were massacred in pogroms, slaughtered in death camps or otherwise murdered by Romanian authorities, German forces and others during the war. Rosenthal was 16 when he was taken to Auschwitz, the German Nazi camp in occupied Poland. Later, he was transferred to Buchenwald, another camp near Weimar, Germany, where he was forced to work for the Nazis<e5><U+0289><U+06E5> the only reason he was kept alive until U.S. military forces began to evacuate the camp<U+0089><U+06EA>s 28,000 prisoners in 1945. He came to the U.S. hoping to find a new beginning. <U+0089><db><cf>After I was liberated, I thought to myself the world has learned what terrible traces hate can bring to humanity,<U+0089><U+06DD> he said. <U+0089><db><cf>And now this gives me a depressing feeling because it<U+0089><U+06EA>s happening again, and it<U+0089><U+06EA>s happening now.<U+0089><U+06DD> The successful real estate agent watched the protests from his home in Roslyn, New York, where he lives during the warmer months of the year. In the winter, Rosenthal flies to Florida. Decades later, he remembers how hard it was to get settled in the U.S.<e5><ca>while dealing with the trauma from the war. <U+0089><db><cf>When I came here, I used to get really bad nightmares and I would get up in middle of the night not being able to go back to sleep,<U+0089><U+06DD> he said. Those days of lingering fear and uncertainty felt much closer after watching neo-Nazis rage during the violent demonstrations in Charlottesville, he said. But after all the anti-Semitic speeches and the deadly car attack , it was one particular detail that caught Rosenthal<U+0089><U+06EA>s attention. He noticed it while reading about a Aug. 14 court hearing for James Alex Fields Jr., the man accused of plowing his car into a crowd of counterprotesters at the white nationalist rally, leaving a 32-year-old woman dead and injuring at least 19 other people. The article included a photo of Matthew Heimbach, who had helped promote the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, voicing his displeasure outside the courtroom after a judge denied bail for Fields. The white supremacist<U+0089><U+06EA>s T-shirt was the first thing Rosenthal saw. On the shirt was a picture of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, a pre-WWII leader of the Romanian fascist Legion of Saint Michael the Archangel and the Iron Guard political party, which were both linked to the Nazi party. Codreanu urged the destruction of the Jewish community in Romania. Members of his Iron Guard responded with brutality both before and during the war, including a horrifying massacre in Bucharest that killed over 100 Jews. <U+0089><db><cf>I recognized the name right away,<U+0089><U+06DD> Rosenthal said. <U+0089><db><cf>You see something like this, you know, it brings back memories and I<U+0089><U+06EA>m concerned about what could happen in this country,<U+0089><U+06DD> he said. The groups behind the Unite the Right rally are not the only ones of their kind. According to a February report from the Southern Poverty Law Center , at least 917 hate groups exist throughout the country. Many Americans were concerned when President Donald Trump failed to immediately condemn white supremacy in responding to the Charlottesville violence. Instead, Trump blamed both sides of the protests <U+0089><U+06E5> a point he repeated on Tuesday. <U+0089><db><cf>You cannot compare fascism and Nazis to the other people protesting.

Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman, wide receiver Doug Baldwin and former running back Reggie Bush were among those to call out Trump for his remarks: DeMaurice Smith, the executive director of the NFL Players Association, also made his position crystal clear via this statement on Twitter: NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell also released a statement in which it said that <U+0089><db><cf>divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect<U+0089><U+06DD> for the league and its players.

Did you think this was a personal trip?! Adorable! Do you think the US govt paid for our honeymoon or personal travel?! Lololol. Have you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self sacrifice to your country? I<U+0089><U+06EA>m pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day <U+0089><db><cf>trip<U+0089><U+06DD> than you did. Pretty sure the amount we sacrifice per year is a lot more than you<U+0089><U+06EA>d be willing to sacrifice if the choice was yours. You<U+0089><U+06EA>re adorably out of touch. Thanks for the passive aggressive nasty comment. Your kids look very cute. Your life looks cute. I know you<U+0089><U+06EA>re mad but deep down you<U+0089><U+06EA>re really nice and so am I. Sending me passive aggressive Instagram comments isn<U+0089><U+06EA>t going to make life feel better. Maybe a nice message, one filled with wisdom and hunanity [SIC] would get more traction. Have a pleasant evening. Go chill out and watch the new game of thrones. It<U+0089><U+06EA>s fab!<U+0089><U+06DD> Linton on Tuesday released a statement apologizing for her <U+0089><db><cf>inappropriate and highly insensitive<U+0089><U+06DD> Instagram post and her response to Jenni M, according to CNN reporter Jeremy Diamond. Linton<U+0089><U+06EA>s Instagram post comes at a time when her husband is under attack by some of President Donald Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s loyalists for his lack of populist credentials. Linton<U+0089><U+06EA>s out-of-touch post isn<U+0089><U+06EA>t likely to help Mnuchin, the former Goldman Sachs executive who served as the finance chair of Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s presidential campaign. A spokesman for Mnuchin did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Instagram user that Linton attacked also did not respond to a message asking for comment. This is not Linton<U+0089><U+06EA>s first encounter with controversy. In 2016, Linton came under fire for her self-published memoir, In Congo<U+0089><U+06EA>s Shadow , which detailed her time as a student in Zambia. In July of 2016, Zambians, and their advocates, criticized Linton<U+0089><U+06EA>s portrayal of Zambia as a war-torn, poverty-stricken nation with wild animals running through the streets. Linton was also criticized for portraying herself as a white savior. Under pressure, Linton withdrew the book from sale and pledged to give any proceeds to charity. The actress actually dressed as Marie Antoinette in a 2007 episode of <U+0089><db><cf>CSI: NY.<U+0089><U+06DD> Mnuchin and Linton were in Kentucky on Monday to tour Fort Knox , which holds the federal government<U+0089><U+06EA>s $200 billion gold reserves.

175,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anthony-scaramucci-what-went-wrong_us_59811cc9e4b02b36343ec1da","I received a call Monday night from Roger Stone, the infamous political prankster and Donald Trump confidant. He wanted to talk about Anthony Scaramucci , whose 10-day tenure as White House communications director had just ended in ignominy. Stone said that Scaramucci reminded him of <U+0089><db><cf>a suicide bomber,<U+0089><U+06DD> then switched centuries for his next metaphor. <U+0089><db><cf>The administration is like the French Revolution,<U+0089><U+06DD> Stone said. <U+0089><db><cf>You never know who will be beheaded next.<U+0089><U+06DD> But Stone didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t believe that Scaramucci would stay far from the president for long. <U+0089><db><cf>As you know, none of us are ever really gone. He still has the president<U+0089><U+06EA>s cellphone, the president<U+0089><U+06EA>s private number. Just because he<U+0089><U+06EA>s not in the White House, no one should think his influence has gone.<U+0089><U+06DD> When I spoke to Scaramucci on Tuesday afternoon, the financier was more interested in justifying his recent past. From the beginning of his time in the Trump White House , way back on July 20, critics said that Scaramucci was too similar to Trump, too eager to be on TV, to last. Scaramucci was keenly aware of that particular liability. It explains why his opening news conference was so filled with compliments for the president. He knew there was only one person watching whose opinion of him mattered. <U+0089><db><cf>The president thought I killed it,<U+0089><U+06DD> Scaramucci told me the following day, still clearly hyped up by his experience in the White House briefing room. <U+0089><db><cf>If you were 7 inches taller, I<U+0089><U+06EA>d be worried,<U+0089><U+06DD> Trump told Scaramucci, according to someone familiar with the conversation who asked not to be named quoting the president. The euphoria wouldn<U+0089><U+06EA>t last long. A Politico reporter alerted Scaramucci that Ryan Lizza of The New Yorker tweeted Wednesday night that Scaramucci was at dinner with the president, first lady Melania Trump, Fox News host Sean Hannity and former Fox News co-president Bill Shine.  Scaramucci was livid about the information being passed on to a reporter. For one thing, he said the guest list was incomplete. The tweets didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t mention the presence of Ainsley Earhardt and Brian Kilmeade, co-hosts of <U+0089><db><cf>Fox & Friends,<U+0089><U+06DD> as well as White House counselor Kellyanne Conway and Vice President Mike Pence , who, he said, left before the sit-down dinner. For another, he knew that the full guest list also included Kimberly Guilfoyle, co-host of <U+0089><db><cf>The Five<U+0089><U+06DD> on Fox News. Early the next morning, Olivia Nuzzi of New York Magazine confirmed that Guilfoyle was there. Scaramucci realized that the inclusion of Guilfoyle would raise suspicion. He said he was aware that some associates and members of the media were gossiping about his friendship with the Fox host and feared this particular connection would only make matters worse. He said he took it as <U+0089><db><cf>an attack.<U+0089><U+06DD> Scaramucci strongly denies having a sexual relationship with Guilfoyle. Stone, a friend of Guilfoyle<U+0089><U+06EA>s, explained that Scaramucci and Guilfoyle <U+0089><db><cf>are very close friends but nothing more.<U+0089><U+06DD> He added, <U+0089><db><cf>He is way too short for Kimberly.<U+0089><U+06DD> Through a Fox News spokesperson, Guilfoyle said she<U+0089><U+06EA>s known Scaramucci for years through her work at Fox News and the two are <U+0089><db><cf>good friends.<U+0089><U+06DD> As soon as Scaramucci returned from Wednesday night<U+0089><U+06EA>s dinner, he called Lizza and gave his now-infamous interview , published Thursday, in which he suggested that former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus was a <U+0089><db><cf>paranoid schizophrenic<U+0089><U+06DD> and that White House chief strategist Steve Bannon practiced auto-fellatio. Scaramucci said he felt burned by the interview. <U+0089><db><cf> The Lizzas and Scaramuccis have been friends for over 50 years. My dad knew his dad from construction, and we were building a personal relationship. Most of what I said was humorous and joking. Legally, it may have been on the record, but the spirit of it was off. And he knew that.<U+0089><U+06DD> Still, Scaramucci told me, he has plans to take Lizza out for a beer. When I asked Lizza for his response, he wrote back: <U+0089><db><cf> I<U+0089><U+06EA>ve only known Anthony in his capacity as a Trump surrogate and then White House communications director. We are not and have never been <U+0089><db><f7>old family friends,<U+0089><U+06EA> though I think our fathers knew each other, so maybe that<U+0089><U+06EA>s what he<U+0089><U+06EA>s talking about. (The Long Island Italian world in that generation is relatively small.) But again, that would not be a reason to suppress an explosive on-the-record interview.<U+0089><U+06DD> According to several sources close to the White House, the president was initially amused by the Lizza exchange but changed his opinion when he saw how much negative attention it was bringing. Scaramucci said he offered to resign before the weekend. The president told him that wouldn<U+0089><U+06EA>t be necessary, but he instructed Scaramucci to <U+0089><db><cf>watch it<U+0089><U+06DD> in the future, according to someone familiar with the conversation. I spoke with Scaramucci on Saturday morning, and he sounded defeated. <U+0089><db><cf>I think I have strep,<U+0089><U+06DD> he said. On top of everything else, the night before, The New York Post had broken the news of his impending divorce from his second wife, Deidre Ball. That Scaramucci<U+0089><U+06EA>s marriage was in trouble was hardly a secret. Long before Ball filed for divorce on July 6, Scaramucci was open with friends and associates about what he believed to be the sorry state of their union and how they were struggling through regular counseling sessions. He just hated that his relationship was being discussed in public. A follow-up report from the Post said that Scaramucci didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t attend the birth of their son last week. Instead, he sent Ball a short congratulatory text. Scaramucci said this is an unfair characterization of events. He told me that Ball<U+0089><U+06EA>s due date was Aug. 9, so when he boarded Air Force One to West Virginia last Monday to attend the president<U+0089><U+06EA>s address at the National Scout Jamboree, he didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t think he<U+0089><U+06EA>d be in danger of missing the birth. As soon as she texted him that she was going into labor, he said, he looked into chartering a plane from West Virginia but discovered that there was a wide no fly-zone around Air Force One. He explained that he decided to wait to fly back to Washington with the president, then travel to New York from there. As of Tuesday afternoon, he still hadn<U+0089><U+06EA>t met his son. Scaramucci claimed that right after the birth Ball texted him her request for some space. When I asked about this text, Ball<U+0089><U+06EA>s lawyer, Jill Stone, responded: <U+0089><db><cf>Any texts of that nature had nothing to do with the baby or seeing the baby.<U+0089><U+06DD> (Jill Stone said she couldn<U+0089><U+06EA>t comment on the rest of Scaramucci<U+0089><U+06EA>s version of events.) When I spoke to Scaramucci on Saturday, he didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t have much to say about the collapse of his marriage. <U+0089><db><cf>It<U+0089><U+06EA>s fine. I mean, what am I going to do?<U+0089><U+06DD> He perked up when he started talking about the fantastic team he was going to bring into the White House<U+0089><U+06EA>s communications shop and the big plans he was going to enact after a tumultuous first week. But on Monday morning, Scaramucci knew he was cooked. Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly , the new chief of staff, who insisted that all White House staff report to him, asked for his resignation. <U+0089><db><cf>It was a very polite conversation,<U+0089><U+06DD> Scaramucci says. Scaramucci then went to see Trump, who was unavailable. He ended up speaking with the president, his daughter Ivanka Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, separately later in the day by telephone. All were gracious, he said. <U+0089><db><cf>The president told me he knows I have his back, but he has to try to tighten the ship.<U+0089><U+06DD> So what are you going to do next, I asked him. <U+0089><db><cf>I am now going to go dark,<U+0089><U+06DD> he said. And then? <U+0089><db><cf>Then I will reemerge.<U+0089><U+06DD> He paused. <U+0089><db><cf>As me.<U+0089><U+06DD> CLARIFICATION:<e5><ca>The section about Ryan Lizza<U+0089><U+06EA>s and Olivia Nuzzi<U+0089><U+06EA>s tweets was changed to more accurately reflect the night<U+0089><U+06EA>s sequence of events.",1,63.19,8.5,11.5,1290,78,"Why The Mooch Lost His Cool",2017-08-01 22:01:00,"Staff","Politics","@developing,@health_adhd,@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@health_pain,@team_us_news_national_beats,anthony-scaramucci,donald-trump,ryan-lizza,the-new-yorker,type: news,white-house",796176,690363,796176,1646038,133620,416443,1.09,1.171,2.751,3.024,298098,396609,101469,42855,373658,38803,164296,125066,62287,62563,69,2,5236,4236,827,161,12,"Why The Mooch Lost His Cool",2017-08-01 22:01:00,"Staff","Politics","@developing,@health_adhd,@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@health_pain,@team_us_news_national_beats,anthony-scaramucci,donald-trump,ryan-lizza,the-new-yorker,type: news,white-house",796176,690363,796176,1646038,133620,416443,1.09,1.171,2.751,3.024,298098,396609,101469,42855,373658,38803,164296,125066,62287,62563,69,2,5236,4236,827,161,12

According to leaked texts sent and received by his daughter, Andrea Manafort Shand, the two pals were <U+0089><db><cf>perfect allies.<U+0089><U+06DD> The Trump administration has been working overtime to downplay Manafort<U+0089><U+06EA>s role in last year<U+0089><U+06EA>s campaign. <U+0089><db><cf>Paul Manafort was brought in to lead the delegate process, which he did, and was dismissed not too long after that,<U+0089><U+06DD> White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday. <U+0089><db><cf>Paul was brought on sometime in June, and by the middle of August he was no longer with the campaign,<U+0089><U+06DD> then-press secretary Sean Spicer said in March. Spicer<U+0089><U+06EA>s statement was untrue, and Sanders<U+0089><U+06EA> claim was misleading. The public record shows that Manafort, who had known Trump for decades ,<e5><ca>joined his campaign toward the end of March 2016. And Manafort<U+0089><U+06EA>s eventual resignation didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t necessarily indicate he was leaving Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s orbit, according to his daughter<U+0089><U+06EA>s texts. Manafort Shand may have wanted to inflate her father<U+0089><U+06EA>s role to impress her friends. But even after her father stepped down from the campaign last August , Manafort Shand was under the impression that he had continuing influence within the Trump campaign and beyond. The following texts, sent by Manafort Shand to her sister, Jessica Manafort, and to friends and part of a cache discovered by the website Krypt3ia earlier this year, offer a markedly different understanding of the Trump/Manafort relationship than the president and his allies are attempting to sell.<e5><ca>(Manafort previously confirmed the authenticity of several of the other texts to Politico.) The texts have been lightly edited for grammar and clarity. March 17, 2016: The Manafort daughters claim Trump asked their father to run his campaign. Jessica Manafort: Guess who called Dad last night and asked him to run his convention. Andrea Manafort Shand: Mom told me he was going to call dad. She told me to get ready for Trump to be president and pick the position in the White House I want. JM: Dad gave him his list of requirements and so long as he can fulfill the list, Dad accepted. March 29:<e5><ca>Even before he was announced as campaign chairman, her father<U+0089><U+06EA>s role was much larger than the public knew,<e5><ca>Manafort Shand claims. Friend: I<U+0089><U+06EA>m not paying enough attention to really form an opinion. But yea I think economy makes sense, just hate what an asshole<e5><ca>[Trump] is in the process. AMS: Well hopefully my dad will help scale that back. That<U+0089><U+06EA>s part of the reason he was brought on. He is refusing payment. Bc he doesn<U+0089><U+06EA>t want to be viewed as Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s employee. Only having his expenses covered. He is involved purely because he wants to help the country and he thinks trump is best, so long as trump gets trained a bit. PS this is all top secret, so please do not repeat. AMS: Dude he is second in command. Perhaps arguably running it. The campaign manager is all for show. [Corey Lewandowski] doesn<U+0089><U+06EA>t do shit. Trump has been managing his own campaign April 7: Manafort Shand paints her father as a master manipulator who is a close ally of Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s. [ After sending her friend a CNN article hinting at Manafort<U+0089><U+06EA>s expanded role within the campaign. ] Friend: Is Paul getting a bigger role?! Seems like it ... AMS : You<U+0089><U+06EA>re surprised?? I told you this was the game. You think Paul does anything in moderation? Friend : And like, if Trump gets elected, guess who<U+0089><U+06EA>s gonna be chief of staff ... AMS : Phffff. He would never accept. Friend : Too many skeletons in his closet? AMS : Too constrictive. Paul is a lone wolf. Has to go his own way. Do what he wants when he wants how he wants. He doesn<U+0089><U+06EA>t have room for other people and their needs/wants. Friend : Yea that sounds about right AMS : He likes the challenge. That<U+0089><U+06EA>s why he<U+0089><U+06EA>s doing this. It<U+0089><U+06EA>s a game for him. He isn<U+0089><U+06EA>t being paid. Friend : Man I bet he<U+0089><U+06EA>s loving it. AMS : This is pure sport. He is a power hungry egomaniac. Yes. He is loving it. Conclusively. Him and trump are perfect allies for this agenda. It<U+0089><U+06EA>s so weird he is my dad. [ Later ] AMS : It<U+0089><U+06EA>s just weird. Like<e5><ca>[my dad] doesn<U+0089><U+06EA>t seem that smart. Like he is smart.

I did inherit that ability. But I don<U+0089><U+06EA>t exploit it like he does. I know all his tactics. They aren<U+0089><U+06EA>t that brilliant but they do work. Friend : But yes you<U+0089><U+06EA>re right, you have a moral conscious [sic]. AMS : Like he just tells you the sky is green over and over. And eventually you are like is it? I don<U+0089><U+06EA>t possess the ability to just lie like he does. Friend : Yea he works his charm. AMS : It<U+0089><U+06EA>s confidence. When you say something unwaveringly, people start to believe it. Friend : I mean yea that got Trump where he is today. AMS : Yup. Perfect allies. Trump probably has more morals than my dad. Which is really just saying something about my dad. My dad is a psycho!!! At least trump let his wives leave him. Plus, Trump has been a good father. AMS : Trump waited a little too long in my opinion, but I can attest to the fact that he has now hired one of the world<U+0089><U+06EA>s greatest manipulators. I hope my dad pulls it off. Then I can sell my memoir with all his dirty secrets for a pretty penny. [ Later, Manafort Shand talks to another friend about her feelings regarding the campaign. ] AMS : He was brought on to be convention manager, but really it was always to run shit. And now that<U+0089><U+06EA>s being publicly known. Or acknowledged I guess. [ Later ] JM : Dad and Trump are literally living in the same building and mom says they go up and down all day long hanging and plotting together April 12: Manafort Shand offers campaign-related favors from her father to a friend. AMS : By the way, if you want to exploit my dad to better your career, please let me know. Friend : Are you serious? AMS : Completely. Friend : I wouldn<U+0089><U+06EA>t be opposed to exploiting him. AMS : I am on a business email basis with my dad. [ Later ] AMS : My dad is Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s right-hand man right now and will be through November. But he won<U+0089><U+06EA>t accept any position in the White House, so his leverage will diminish at that point (assuming Trump wins). April 13: Manafort refused payment as a power play, his daughter claims. AMS : Yup. That<U+0089><U+06EA>s a match made in heaven. Egomaniacs galore. AMS : But yea<e5><ca>[my dad is] super tight with the Trumps. All the kids call him all the time. And him and Trump both live in Trump Tower in NYC. So it<U+0089><U+06EA>s like a sitcom. Although <U+0089><db><d3> top top secret. Can<U+0089><U+06EA>t repeat, promise? My dad isn<U+0089><U+06EA>t getting paid for trump. Friend : WHAT, really? AMS : He refused payment. Trump is only covering expenses. Friend : Political favors later? AMS : Eh maybe but the truth of it is, I think there are rules for how much you can pay campaign personnel, so it isn<U+0089><U+06EA>t much to start with <U+0089><db><d3> not to my dad anyway. And my dad wants Trump to listen to him and respect him. View him as an equal, not as staff. So refusing payment makes it so. And makes it clear to Trump why my dad is doing it <U+0089><db><d3> because he wants to. AMS : And my dad won<U+0089><U+06EA>t take an appointment either. Trump knows that, too. So this isn<U+0089><U+06EA>t for personal gain for my dad, and that<U+0089><U+06EA>s true <U+0089><db><d3> not a game. So why is my dad doing it? Sport. AMS : This is his wheelhouse. And he gets off on power too. My dad loves challenges and this is like a chess game. He got a mistress because he was bored. Trump is his new mistress. May 19:<e5><ca>Although her father was never officially co-manager with Lewandowski, Manafort Shand claims that was effectively the case. [ After sending her friend a link to an ABC article about Manafort moving up yet again within the campaign .] AMS : My mom told me they were gonna call them co-managers, and then Corey went to Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s son-in-law,<e5><ca>Ivanka<U+0089><U+06EA>s husband, and burst into tears about how that would ruin him. So since my dad doesn<U+0089><U+06EA>t care about titles, this was the compromise. May 26: Manafort Shand offers campaign-related favors from her father to Lockheed Martin. Friend : Helleeew! I have an awkward favor/question to ask, so if you<U+0089><U+06EA>re not down, I totally understand. I<U+0089><U+06EA>m not sure how you and your dad are these days, and I<U+0089><U+06EA>m gonna guess you<U+0089><U+06EA>re overloaded with requests to get in touch, but if it<U+0089><U+06EA>s do-able, could you help me get in touch with or pass on an email to someone in your dads office? AMS : Sure, what<U+0089><U+06EA>s your end goal? Friend : It<U+0089><U+06EA>s not an effort to help the campaign. My dad works for Lockheed Martin, and they want to essentially let Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s transition team know that they<U+0089><U+06EA>re ready, available, and happy to provide info about defense acquisition and sustainment. So to discuss policy. But they can<U+0089><U+06EA>t reach out to Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s team <U+0089><db><d3> the team would have to reach out to them. So I<U+0089><U+06EA>ve got an email with info that would be amazing if passed on to the right people. Again <U+0089><db><d3> if this is not your cup of tea, totally forget I asked. I<U+0089><U+06EA>m only asking bc it<U+0089><U+06EA>s my dad. AMS : I hear ya <U+0089><db><d3> it<U+0089><U+06EA>s not a problem, I just think it<U+0089><U+06EA>s probably a bit early. But I can ask my mom who the right person would be to receive the email. I would imagine Rick Davis or Rick Gates. But I<U+0089><U+06EA>ll find out and let you/them know. Friend : Thank you!! I really appreciate it. I think they want to get in front ahead of time instead of play catch up. I feel weird asking for a favor like this haha. AMS : You<U+0089><U+06EA>re not the first. It<U+0089><U+06EA>s no bother. I am happy to be a conduit. I just can<U+0089><U+06EA>t promise anything other than initial access. Friend : Just being a conduit is amazing! Zero expectations, just doin what I can for my dad so anything at all is fucking great. AMS :<e5><ca>Totally get it. Not every day you know the man behind the man. Gotta exploit it. Which is why I am happy to help. Cuz fuck it, hopefully someone can benefit by my relation to the count of Monte Cristo. June 20: Manafort had enough sway to pick Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s vice president,<e5><ca>his daughter claims. AMS : My dad is picking VP. So there<U+0089><U+06EA>s that. Aug. 17: Trump hires Steve Bannon and promotes Kellyanne Conway . Manafort Shand claims that her father was really the one who hired them and that public perception of his being sidelined is incorrect. AMS : [My dad] hasn<U+0089><U+06EA>t been demoted. That<U+0089><U+06EA>s total bullshit. No surprise that the media is wrong. Again. My dad hired those 2 people. Interviewed them in trump towers Aug. 19: Manafort Shand claims that her father<U+0089><U+06EA>s resignation was merely to appease the public, but that he<U+0089><U+06EA>s still very much involved. AMS : So I got to the bottom of it. As I suspected, my dad resigned from being the public face of the campaign but is still very much involved behind the scenes. He felt he was becoming a distraction and that would ultimately take a toll on the campaign. Friend : Wow. Well, I<U+0089><U+06EA>m really glad he<U+0089><U+06EA>s still part of it. Seriously, who knows what would have happened at the convention if he wasn<U+0089><U+06EA>t running the show. AMS : Yes for sure. He said that, in the next few weeks, we should hopefully be seeing a new Trump, so to speak. Last night<U+0089><U+06EA>s speech was a speech my dad had been pushing him to make for several weeks, and since it was so well-received, he thinks Trump will be more responsive to doing things a bit differently. [ Later ] Friend : Thoughts go out to your pops <U+0089><db><d3> I can only imagine that he<U+0089><U+06EA>s relieved, angry, hurting, a combination of a lot of emotions. Wishing you and your fam the best AMS : Hahaha, you<U+0089><U+06EA>re so silly. It<U+0089><U+06EA>s all just PR.

179,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/eric-bolling-fox-news-text-messages_us_5984d2bbe4b0cb15b1be6d65","Eric Bolling, a longtime Fox News host, sent an unsolicited photo of male genitalia via text message to at least two colleagues at Fox Business and one colleague at Fox News , a dozen sources told HuffPost. Recipients of the photo confirmed its contents to HuffPost, which is not revealing their identities. The women, who are Bolling<U+0089><U+06EA>s current and former Fox colleagues, concluded the message was from him because they recognized his number from previous work-related and informal interactions. The messages were sent several years ago, on separate occasions. The women did not solicit the messages, which they told colleagues were deeply upsetting and offensive. One of the recipients said that when she replied to Bolling via text, telling him never to send her such photos again, he did not respond. Four people, outside of the recipients, confirmed to HuffPost they<U+0089><U+06EA>d seen the photo, and eight others said the recipients had spoken to them about it. For this story, HuffPost spoke to 14 sources in and out of Fox News and Fox Business, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity either because they currently work at the networks and aren<U+0089><U+06EA>t allowed to speak to members of the press without prior authorization or because they have confidentiality agreements with Fox News and its parent company 21st Century Fox. Over the past year, the network has been rocked by multiple accusations of sexual harassment and assault by Fox News and Fox Business executives and on-air talent. Last year, former Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes resigned after former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson filed a lawsuit accusing him of sexual harassment. Since Ailes was forced out, multiple former and current Fox News hosts have accused him of harassment, including CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota. Last April, after a bombshell New York Times report revealed that Bill O<U+0089><U+06EA>Reilly had quietly settled multiple sexual harassment suits, the network forced him out. Reached Friday by HuffPost about the accusations against Bolling, a Fox spokesperson said,<e5><U+0289><db><cf>We were just informed of this and plan to investigate the matter.<U+0089><U+06DD> When asked whether Bolling at any point had sent unsolicited lewd or inappropriate text messages or emails (including an image of a man<U+0089><U+06EA>s genitalia) to Fox News or Fox Business colleagues, his attorney Michael J. Bowe responded, <U+0089><db><cf>Mr. Bolling recalls no such inappropriate communications, does not believe he sent any such communications, and will vigorously pursue his legal remedies for any false and defamatory accusations that are made.<U+0089><U+06DD> Bolling, a former commodities trader, has worked at the Fox News and Fox Business networks since 2007, when he joined after leaving CNBC. He has had a history of making misogynistic on-air remarks during his tenure at Fox News, the most notable during a September 2014 segment on the panel show <U+0089><db><cf>The Five<U+0089><U+06DD> while discussing the first woman fighter pilot from the United Arab Emirates leading the bombing of the Islamic State. Bolling asked on air if instead of saying <U+0089><db><cf>boots on the ground<U+0089><U+06DD> it would be more appropriate to say <U+0089><db><cf>boobs on the ground.<U+0089><U+06DD> He apologized the next day, citing <U+0089><db><cf>a look<U+0089><U+06DD> he got from his wife when he arrived home. The allegations against Bolling recall statements he made attacking Anthony Weiner in 2014, after the former New York congressman had been embroiled in a scandal for sexting several women. During a Twitter war with Weiner, Bolling concluded with a tweet that said: <U+0089><db><cf>text us if you want a fair & balanced intv **NO SEFIES PLEASE [sic]**<U+0089><U+06DD> In May 2017, when Weiner pleaded guilty to federal charges of exchanging lewd messages with an underage girl, Bolling said , <U+0089><db><cf>He is a sick human being, to continue to do this time and time again, continue to get caught, saying he<U+0089><U+06EA>s not going to do it again, gets caught again.<U+0089><U+06DD> Bolling serves as one of the co-hosts of <U+0089><db><cf>The Specialists,<U+0089><U+06DD> a new program on the Fox News Channel. Previously, he served as one of the hosts of <U+0089><db><cf>The Five<U+0089><U+06DD> and as a fill-in host for O<U+0089><U+06EA>Reilly and Sean Hannity. After the network fired O<U+0089><U+06EA>Reilly last April, Fox News announced that Bolling would leave the <U+0089><db><cf>The Five<U+0089><U+06DD> and host another panel program at 5 p.m. with co-hosts Eboni Williams and Katherine Timpf. Bolling<U+0089><U+06EA>s star at the Fox Networks has risen in the past two years, in part because of his close relationship with and strong support of President Donald Trump. Bolling can often be seen aggressively defending Trump on the network, and his loyalty has been repaid. Over the past few years, Trump has tweeted praise and support for Bolling at least a dozen times, including support for his book in 2016. When <U+0089><db><cf>The Specialists<U+0089><U+06DD> premiered earlier this year, Bolling was granted an exclusive interview with Trump. Fox News recently renewed Bolling<U+0089><U+06EA>s contract. In a statement in June, Fox News co-president Suzanne Scott said that Bolling<U+0089><U+06EA>s <U+0089><db><cf> insight is valued, and we are pleased to have him at the network for many more years to come.<U+0089><U+06DD> The multiyear extension ended speculation that he was going to accept a position in the Trump administration. In an interview with NJ.Com, Bolling said the Trump transition had floated the position of commerce secretary, but he said he would only consider joining as a senior adviser. In the interview, Bolling said he believed he had a future in politics : <U+0089><db><cf> When the lights go down on my TV career, the next step is running for Senate.<U+0089><U+06DD> Follow Yashar <U+0089><db><d3> or send him a tip <U+0089><db><d3> on Twitter: @yashar",0,55.07,11.7,12.8,908,37,"Fox News Host Sent Unsolicited Lewd Text Messages To Colleagues, Sources Say",2017-08-04 20:23:00,"Yashar Ali","Politics","@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_national_beats,eric-bolling,fox-business-network,fox-entertainment-group,fox-news,hate-speech,must-reads,type: news,us-news",755574,627402,755574,674774,190200,337130,1.084,1.155,1.38,1.19,248909,400257,106408,133370,294444,112055,100095,68832,48255,19344,13,16,36633,26819,9649,115,50,"Fox News Host Sent Unsolicited Lewd Text Messages To Colleagues, Sources Say",2017-08-04 20:23:00,"Yashar Ali","Politics","@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_national_beats,eric-bolling,fox-business-network,fox-entertainment-group,fox-news,hate-speech,must-reads,type: news,us-news",755574,627402,755574,674774,190200,337130,1.084,1.155,1.38,1.19,248909,400257,106408,133370,294444,112055,100095,68832,48255,19344,13,16,36633,26819,9649,115,50

Scaramucci was named communications director on July 21, a mere 10 days ago. Axios reports he resigned at the request of Gen. John Kelly, the new White House chief of staff. <U+0089><db><cf>Mr. Scaramucci felt it was best to give Chief of Staff John Kelly a clean slate and the ability to build his own team,<U+0089><U+06DD> a statement from the White House press secretary said Monday. <U+0089><db><cf>We wish him all the best.<U+0089><U+06DD> According to CBS and CNN, Scaramucci was escorted from White House grounds Monday. The resignation comes after a controversy-laden week for Scaramucci that included a profanity-laced tirade against other members of President Donald Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s White House staff. His rant, published in The New Yorker, was mostly aimed at then-White House chief of staff Reince Priebus. ( Priebus resigned from his post last week and was replaced Monday morning by Kelly.) Scaramucci referred to Priebus as <U+0089><db><cf>a fucking paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac.<U+0089><U+06DD> Scaramucci also gave one of the more memorable quotes so far of the Trump administration during that interview, while arguing that he doesn<U+0089><U+06EA>t care for media attention. <U+0089><db><cf>I<U+0089><U+06EA>m not Steve Bannon, I<U+0089><U+06EA>m not trying to suck my own cock,<U+0089><U+06DD> he said. But that rant wasn<U+0089><U+06EA>t the only eyebrow-raising moment during his 10 days in the White House. Scaramucci brought on criticism after directing comments about hair and makeup at White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. He also reportedly received divorce papers from his wife, who gave birth to the couple<U+0089><U+06EA>s son while Scaramucci was with Trump last week. Michael Short, an aide in the White House press office, resigned last week because of pressure from Scaramucci, who had threatened to <U+0089><db><cf>fire everybody<U+0089><U+06DD> in order to stop leaks. Even his hire was laden with controversy. Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer reportedly submitted his resignation after learning Trump was giving Scaramucci a prominent role on the White House communications team. Scaramucci<U+0089><U+06EA>s short tenure followed that of Mike Dubke, who resigned in May after just three months as White House communications director.

Earlier this week, Trump said he needed to get all <U+0089><db><cf>the facts<U+0089><U+06DD> before singling out hate groups for condemnation after violent protests sparked by a white supremacist rally left one woman dead in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday. Trump initially posted a measured response to the incident in Barcelona: Less than an hour after his initial tweet, Trump followed up, implying the Barcelona attack was linked to <U+0089><db><cf>Radical Islamic Terror<U+0089><U+06DD>: During the Republican presidential primary race, Trump told crowds a story <U+0089><U+06E5> a false one , according to historians <U+0089><U+06E5> about John <U+0089><db><cf>Black Jack<U+0089><U+06DD> Pershing, the Army general who commanded U.S. forces in World War I. According to Mother Jones ,<e5><ca>Trump spoke of Pershing executing Muslim insurgents in the Philippines in the early 1900s with bullets dipped in pig<U+0089><U+06EA>s blood and eliminating <U+0089><db><cf>a problem<U+0089><U+06DD> for 25 years (unlike the 35 years mentioned in his tweet): He caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage<U+0089><db>_and he took the 50 terrorists and he took 50 men and dipped 50 bullets in pig<U+0089><U+06EA>s blood. You heard about that? He took 50 bullets and dipped them in pig<U+0089><U+06EA>s blood [which is considered haram]. And he has his men load up their rifles and he lined up the 50 people and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said, you go back to your people and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years there wasn<U+0089><U+06EA>t a problem. After telling that story, Trump claimed<e5><U+0289><db><cf>we<U+0089><U+06EA>ve got to start getting tough and we<U+0089><U+06EA>ve got to start being vigilant and we<U+0089><U+06EA>ve got to start using our heads or we<U+0089><U+06EA>re not gonna have a country, folks.<U+0089><U+06DD> As Time reported in 2016 , historians know of no evidence to support Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s claim. The magazine quoted one saying it would have been <U+0089><db><cf>out of character<U+0089><U+06DD> for Pershing. Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s comments on Barcelona came just hours after news broke of the carnage there, which police confirmed they were treating as a terrorist attack. The so-called Islamic State claimed responsibility for the assault via its Amaq news agency, but it<U+0089><U+06EA>s unclear to what degree the group<U+0089><U+06EA>s leadership was involved in planning it. White House chief of staff John Kelly briefed Trump on the matter Thursday afternoon. Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s quick response sharply contrasts with his reactions to the violence in Charlottesville. Trump argued in his initial response on Saturday that<e5><U+0289><db><cf>many sides<U+0089><U+06DD> were to blame for the tumult, which erupted amid a white supremacist protest against efforts to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. The president didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t explicitly condemn hate groups until Monday,<e5><ca>two days after a car allegedly driven by a white supremacist plowed into a group of counterprotesters, killing a 32-year-old woman . In a rambling press conference Tuesday, Trump defended his initial statement, arguing he needed to get <U+0089><db><cf>the facts<U+0089><U+06DD> before making more definitive remarks against racist groups. <U+0089><db><cf>I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct, not make a quick statement. The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement, but you don<U+0089><U+06EA>t make statements that direct unless you know the facts,<U+0089><U+06DD> Trump said Tuesday. <U+0089><db><cf>It takes a little while to get the facts. You still don<U+0089><U+06EA>t know the facts. It is a very, very important process to me. It is a very important statement. So I don<U+0089><U+06EA>t want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement. I want to know the facts.<U+0089><U+06DD> Trump on Tuesday also again blamed <U+0089><db><cf>both sides<U+0089><U+06DD> for the clashes in Charlottesville. <U+0089><db><cf>You had a group on one side that was bad. You had a group on the other side that was also very violent,<U+0089><U+06DD> Trump said. <U+0089><db><cf>Nobody wants to say that. I<U+0089><U+06EA>ll say it right now.<U+0089><U+06DD> But Trump has been quick to cite <U+0089><db><cf>radical Islamic terrorism<U+0089><U+06DD> for attacks in the past. It took him less than a day to respond to terrorist attacks in Paris, Manchester, England, and London, the last of which he used as a reason to plug his proposal for a travel ban from several Muslim-majority countries. His rhetoric toward <U+0089><db><cf>radical Islam<U+0089><U+06DD> is often violent and sweeping, unlike his comments on the white supremacist and racist groups who gathered for the rally in Charlottesville,<e5><ca>which Trump claimed had some <U+0089><db><cf> fine people .<U+0089><U+06DD> As Vox has pointed out, Trump has been generally slow to respond to violent incidents where Muslims are the victims.

The details of Bannon<U+0089><U+06EA>s departure remain unclear. The New York Times reported Trump had decided to remove Bannon, but also that a source close to Bannon said the adviser had submitted his resignation on Aug. 7 to be effective Aug. 14. MSNBC <U+0089><U+06EA>s Stephanie Ruhle also tweeted Bannon is <U+0089><db><cf>out.<U+0089><U+06DD> CNN<U+0089><U+06EA>s Jim Acosta and Axios<U+0089><U+06EA> Jonathan Swan both tweeted Bannon had been fired.

Charlie Spiering, Breitbart<U+0089><U+06EA>s White House correspondent, said Bannon had returned immediately and chaired an editorial meeting on Friday.

Backlash over Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s response to white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia ,<e5><ca>may have also led to the departure.<e5><ca>Former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci on Sunday blamed Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s failure to directly call out far-right groups on Bannon. Scaramucci himself was fired after just 10 days on the job , after he forced out then-chief of staff Reince Priebus . Both Bannon and Priebus had strongly objected to Scaramucci<U+0089><U+06EA>s hiring, and former press secretary Sean Spicer resigned over it . In a statement, the Democratic National Committee said Bannon<U+0089><U+06EA>s departure would mean <U+0089><db><cf>there is one less white supremacist in the White House, but that doesn<U+0089><U+06EA>t change the man sitting behind the Resolute desk.<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><cf>Donald Trump has spent decades fueling hate in communities, including his recent attempts to divide our country and give a voice to white supremacists,<U+0089><U+06DD> the group said in a statement. Bannon, who left Breitbart to run Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s campaign in August 2016, pushed Trump to be loyal to the populist base that got him elected. He was a conservative force in the West Wing who helped draft Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s controversial ban on travel and immigration from several Muslim-majority countries. Bannon was once considered one of the most influential members of Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s inner circle, but he has receded from public view in recent months. After his feud with Jared Kushner, Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s son-in-law, became public earlier this year, Trump urged the two to work it out. Politico also reported Trump was upset over a new book highlighting the importance of Bannon<U+0089><U+06EA>s role in Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s presidential campaign. Bannon also gave a bizarre interview this week to The American Prospect, a progressive publication, calling white supremacists a <U+0089><db><cf>collection of clowns<U+0089><U+06DD> and contradicted Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s military threats to North Korea. In April, when Bannon and Kushner feuded, Trump downplayed Bannon<U+0089><U+06EA>s role during his presidential campaign, portraying him as someone who took over in the homestretch and whom he didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t know well . Bannon once pledged to fight for the <U+0089><db><cf> deconstruction of the administrative state .<U+0089><U+06DD><e5><ca>He long assailed establishment Republicans and reportedly called House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) a <U+0089><db><cf>limp-dick motherfucker<U+0089><U+06DD> when there was talk of pushing Ryan to challenge Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s claim to the Republican nomination. Progressives long protested Bannon<U+0089><U+06EA>s elevation to his role as Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s chief strategist, citing his offensive views . Following Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s apparent refusal to denounce the white nationalist protesters in Charlottesville, they renewed their calls to <U+0089><db><cf>fire Bannon.<U+0089><U+06DD> Leaders of the congressional black, Asian, Hispanic and progressive caucuses also had sent a letter to the White House demanding the dismissal of Bannon along with aides Stephen Miller and Sebastian Gorka, saying their presence in the White House emboldened white supremacists across the country. The letter came after Trump faced criticism for initially condemning <U+0089><db><cf>all sides<U+0089><U+06DD> after the violent protests in Charlottesville. <U+0089><db><cf>Americans deserve to know that white nationalists, white supremacists, and neo-Nazis are not in a position to influence U.S. policy,<U+0089><U+06DD> the letter said. <U+0089><db><cf>That is why we continue to find Steve Bannon<U+0089><U+06EA>s presence in your administration incredibly alarming and dangerous to our nation and the world, and once again, we urge you to immediately remove Steve Bannon from the White House altogether.

He assumed that he<U+0089><U+06EA>d be put in charge of the public liaison office, a job that Valerie Jarrett held in the Obama administration. He had it all mapped out, according to the White House adviser. He identified 2,500 influential business leaders across the United States and had come up with a clever name for them: Trump Team 2,500. He believed these people would help pressure Congress into supporting the president<U+0089><U+06EA>s agenda. But Scaramucci<U+0089><U+06EA>s plans were foiled in early January. That<U+0089><U+06EA>s when Priebus, according to a confidant of both Scaramucci and the president, told Trump, <U+0089><db><cf>He played you.<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><cf>How<U+0089><U+06EA>s that?<U+0089><U+06DD> Trump asked Priebus, according to the same source, who has spoken to several people within the White House about the conversation. Priebus then told Trump that he felt Scaramucci had been offered too much for SkyBridge by HNA Group. The deal, he implied, smelled bad <U+0089><db><d3> as if the Chinese might expect favors from within the administration for that inflated price. The source also said that Priebus mentioned there was email traffic between Scaramucci and the Chinese proving this. The White House rejected this version of events and declined to make Priebus available for comment. Ultimately, Scaramucci was not offered the job. But he didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t give up. He asked Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner to get him in the door. According to two people familiar with the conversation, Kushner assured him that he didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t think Scaramucci was <U+0089><db><cf>shady,<U+0089><U+06DD> adding, <U+0089><db><cf>But it<U+0089><U+06EA>s not what I think that matters.<U+0089><U+06DD> Priebus had already planted the seed of doubt in Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s mind . Scaramucci then tried presidential adviser Steve Bannon, who, according to those same two people, explained that he was too busy attempting to save the job of another adviser, Stephen Miller, to spend time or capital trying to help Scaramucci. A friend of Scaramucci<U+0089><U+06EA>s said he complained that some in the White House assumed his finances were suspect because he<U+0089><U+06EA>s of Italian descent. Scaramucci also took Priebus<U+0089><U+06EA> behavior as a sign that Priebus was feeling insecure about his own job. <U+0089><db><cf>I will try things the Washington way first,<U+0089><U+06DD> Trump had told his inner circle when he first named Priebus chief of staff, according to the confidant of Scaramucci and Trump. The implication was clear: If the Washington way did not work, then the New York real estate way would take over. Finally, Scaramucci went to Keith Schiller, the president<U+0089><U+06EA>s longtime bodyguard. He asked Schiller to put him on the phone with Trump so that he could lodge his complaints directly. The president listened, according to their mutual friend, and said he would find a position for Scaramucci as soon as he could. In June, Scaramucci was appointed to be senior vice president and chief strategy officer of the Export-Import Bank. But the Priebus incident lingered in his mind. So, on July 11, when Donald Trump Jr. found himself in trouble for holding a meeting with several people close to the Russian government the previous summer, Scaramucci sensed an opportunity. According to the mutual friend, Scaramucci told everyone he spoke to that day, including the president, that he was sure the person who divulged details of the meeting was Priebus. Scaramucci made the case <U+0089><db><d3> not necessarily backed by evidence <U+0089><db><d3> that with all the leaks targeting the administration, it was odd that only a few had hit Priebus directly. Ten days later, Scaramucci was named the new White House communications director. The announcement noted that he would be reporting directly to the president <U+0089><db><d3> an unusual move that leapfrogged over the chief of staff. Priebus balked, insisting that Scaramucci report to him. But Trump overrode his chief of staff. Not only was the hedge fund manager who had known Trump for 21 years officially in charge of the press shop, but he was also set to oversee the reorganization of the White House. Scaramucci seemed to have his revenge. At least until Thursday evening. In an interview with The New Yorker , Scaramucci called Priebus <U+0089><db><cf>a fucking paranoid schizophrenic<U+0089><U+06DD> and explained how he, unlike Bannon, is <U+0089><db><cf>not trying to suck my own cock.<U+0089><U+06DD> Now, Scaramucci<U+0089><U+06EA>s future at the White House is less clear, even if Trump reportedly <U+0089><db><cf> loved <U+0089><U+06DD> the outburst. Two sources close to the president said the very traits that have so endeared Scaramucci to Trump <U+0089><db><d3> tenacity, frankness, limitless swagger <U+0089><db><d3> could end up endangering his new job if he continues to steal news cycles from the president. But those same sources said he<U+0089><U+06EA>s safe for now. <U+0089><db><cf>Mark my words: Anthony will ultimately be an exceptionally good communications director,<U+0089><U+06DD> said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump aide who still talks to the president. <U+0089><db><cf>His career proves he<U+0089><U+06EA>s a master communicator.

Having passed tax cuts that provide modest help to most Americans, Trump and GOP leaders are finding that most Americans just don<U+0089><U+06EA>t believe it. A CNN poll earlier this month found that only 21 percent of respondents believed they would be better off under the tax plan, while 37 percent believed they would be worse off. Another 36 percent thought they would not be affected much either way. In reality <U+0089><db><d2> at least until the individual tax cuts expire at the end of 2025 <U+0089><db><d2> the vast majority of families will benefit from the cuts, although not necessarily that much for the typical middle-income family. While the overall benefits skew toward the wealthy because of the dramatic 40-percent reduction in the corporate income tax rate, some 80 percent of taxpayers will see a tax reduction next year, according to the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, while 5 percent will get a tax increase and the remainder will see little difference. That disconnect is not surprising to Neil Newhouse, a prominent Republican pollster. <U+0089><db><cf>The data you<U+0089><U+06EA>re seeing is measuring voter reaction to the Trump-GOP tax plan, and neither of those brands is scoring particularly well right now,<U+0089><U+06DD> Newhouse said. <U+0089><db><cf>Voters are responding less to what<U+0089><U+06EA>s actually in the tax plan and more to who<U+0089><U+06EA>s taking credit for it.<U+0089><U+06DD> Trump <U+0089><U+06E5> as he has done regularly whenever confronted with news he does not like <U+0089><U+06E5> blamed the media for the plan<U+0089><U+06EA>s unpopularity. <U+0089><db><cf>The Massive Tax Cuts, which the Fake News Media is desperate to write badly about so as to please their Democrat bosses, will soon be kicking in and will speak for themselves,<U+0089><U+06DD> the president tweeted on Thursday. <U+0089><db><cf>Companies are already making big payments to workers. Dems want to raise taxes, hate these big Cuts!<U+0089><U+06DD> Many Republicans agree with Trump that the news media have emphasized how much the tax plan will benefit the wealthy <U+0089><db><d2> including Trump himself <U+0089><db><d2> but failed to point out that the typical middle-class family would also benefit by about $78 per month. <U+0089><db><cf>Republicans are correct to assume that the bill will become more popular when people see it in their paychecks,<U+0089><U+06DD> said Rory Cooper, once a top aide to former Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. But Cooper and others acknowledge that some of the public<U+0089><U+06EA>s skepticism is based on Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s apparent inability or unwillingness to communicate truthfully <U+0089><db><d2> a trait that has extended to the tax cut bill as well. On Wednesday, for instance, on a day that Trump might have simply stated the facts about the bill<U+0089><U+06EA>s final passage and the benefits it contained, he instead decided to embellish, so that the first three statements he made about the bill were all untrue. Trump claimed that tax legislation <U+0089><db><cf>really hasn<U+0089><U+06EA>t been done<U+0089><U+06DD> before <U+0089><db><d2> which was false. He then claimed that the bill was <U+0089><db><cf>the largest tax cut in the history of our country<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><d2> which was also false. And then he claimed that the tax cuts for individuals totaled $3.2 trillion <U+0089><db><d2> which is not remotely close to true. The bill cuts taxes in all by about $1.8 trillion over 10 years, of which $1.2 trillion goes to individuals and households. <U+0089><db><cf>Completely unnecessary,<U+0089><U+06DD> said Republican political consultant Rick Tyler about Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s string of falsehoods. <U+0089><db><cf>He thinks that just because he says something, people will believe it. He probably believes it. Because he exhibits all the symptoms of a pathological liar.<U+0089><U+06DD> Tyler, like most Republicans, supports the tax cuts. He argues that the wealthy pay most of the federal taxes that are collected, so it<U+0089><U+06EA>s not unreasonable to see them benefit the most from a tax cut. <U+0089><db><cf>I think the administration and the Republicans made a communications error by saying it<U+0089><U+06EA>s going to be a huge break for the middle class,<U+0089><U+06DD> Tyler said, adding that families will be able to make their own decision about the law once they start seeing changes in their paychecks. But Republicans counting on the tax cuts to give them a big political boost come next Election Day may be in for a disappointment. President George W. Bush<U+0089><U+06EA>s 2001 tax cuts were larger than the ones just passed, and even included $600 <U+0089><db><cf>rebate<U+0089><U+06DD> checks mailed to taxpayers. Yet just two years later, only 19 percent of Americans believed their taxes had gone down, while 32 percent believed their taxes had risen. President Barack Obama and a Democratic Congress passed a payroll tax cut in 2010 that saved the typical family $1,000 through reduced payroll deductions. Voters again did not seem to notice it, and believed their taxes had gone up. Whether Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s tax cuts are viewed the same way remains to be seen, said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll. <U+0089><db><cf>Does this help him or not?

Their respective daughters play on the teams that their fathers coach. When Victim B approached Yeatman and asked him if he worked at Netflix, she says he answered in the affirmative. Victim B said she asked Yeatman why Netflix was not taking action against Masterson in light of the district attorney<U+0089><U+06EA>s investigation and the multiple accusations of rape. According to Victim B and another witness, Yeatman said Netflix takes sexual misconduct allegations seriously but that <U+0089><db><cf>we don<U+0089><U+06EA>t believe them,<U+0089><U+06DD> referring to Masterson<U+0089><U+06EA>s four accusers. Victim B told HuffPost she never expected Yeatman to say such a thing and was left stunned. She said she then told him, <U+0089><db><cf>I<U+0089><U+06EA>m one of them,<U+0089><U+06DD> indicating she was one of Masterson<U+0089><U+06EA>s accusers. The conversation ended quickly. Victim B said Yeatman approached her at the game about an hour later, ostensibly to clear the air, and told her that he<U+0089><U+06EA>d had no idea she was one of Masterson<U+0089><U+06EA>s alleged victims. Victim B told HuffPost that she began to cry and told Yeatman, <U+0089><db><cf>I hope no one ever says that to your daughter.<U+0089><U+06DD> Yeatman then told her that he can<U+0089><U+06EA>t decide whether Netflix takes action against Masterson. Victim B told Yeatman that she and the other women accusing Masterson of rape were telling the truth and that <U+0089><db><cf> Netflix is going to regret this, this is a mistake, they<U+0089><U+06EA>re going to see.<U+0089><U+06DD> Victim B said, and the witness confirmed, that Yeatman said, in what they described as a condescending tone, <U+0089><db><cf>we<U+0089><U+06EA>ll see.<U+0089><U+06DD> A Netflix spokesman denied that Yeatman said <U+0089><db><cf>we<U+0089><U+06EA>ll see.<U+0089><U+06DD> But the company confirmed in a statement that Yeatman told Victim B that Netflix executives didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t believe the four women accusing Masterson of rape. <U+0089><db><cf>While he was coaching a youth soccer match today, Mr. Yeatman <U+0089><U+06E5> a Netflix kids<U+0089><U+06EA> programming executive <U+0089><U+06E5> was approached by a stranger who did not identify herself or explain her connection to Danny Masterson,<U+0089><U+06DD> the statement read. <U+0089><db><cf>Mr. Yeatman<U+0089><U+06EA>s comments were careless, uninformed and do not represent the views of the company. Further, he would have no insights into decision making on The Ranch . We are aware of the allegations against Danny Masterson and we are following the current investigation, and will respond if developments occur.<U+0089><U+06DD> Victim B said she initially approached Yeatman when she found out from her husband that he was a Netflix executive. Frustrated by the silence from Netflix on the Masterson issue, she said she hoped he could provide some direction. She said she didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t intend to identify herself as an alleged victim until Yeatman said higher-ups at Netflix didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t believe Masterson<U+0089><U+06EA>s accusers. Victim B noted that she had seen Yeatman in the past at other soccer games and that her husband knew him from previous games. Lilly Yeatman, the wife of Andy Yeatman, sent an email to the husband of Victim B after this piece was initially published, saying Victim B <U+0089><db><cf>has really done a terrible thing to a great guy<U+0089><U+06DD> and that her husband <U+0089><db><cf>is terribly sad and heartbroken for any woman who has been hurt or mistreated.<U+0089><U+06DD> The email, which Victim B provided to HuffPost, was sent from Lilly Yeatman<U+0089><U+06EA>s professional email address at Disney. Neither Disney nor Lilly Yeatman immediately responded to a request for comment. Masterson has been the subject of an almost year-long investigation conducted by the LAPD and the Los Angeles County District Attorney<U+0089><U+06EA>s Office. Four women have accused Masterson of violently raping them in the early 2000s . They have told law enforcement that they believe Masterson spiked their drinks with something that led them to black out before and during the alleged rapes. Masterson has denied all allegations of rape and said that the encounters in question were consensual. An attorney for the actor denied that Masterson ever placed any drugs in someone else<U+0089><U+06EA>s drink and said that as a Scientologist, Masterson has a strict anti-drug policy for himself and for guests in his home. Netflix has known about the accusations since at least March, when journalist Tony Ortega revealed that the LAPD had an active investigation into multiple allegations of rape against the actor. Three of the women who have accused Masterson were members of the Church of Scientology at the time they say they were raped. Church doctrine says that contacting law enforcement to report another Scientologist is a high crime and will lead to being declared a suppressive person <U+0089><U+06E5> meaning that person will be shunned from the church, and their friends and family members who are church members must stop speaking to them. Despite that edict, Victim B filed a police report against Masterson in 2004. But the case was quickly thwarted when dozens of Scientologists filed affidavits with the LAPD claiming that Victim B wasn<U+0089><U+06EA>t telling the truth. The LAPD officially reopened the case against Masterson in January, and referred it to the district attorney in April. Sources in the police department and district attorney<U+0089><U+06EA>s office have described the evidence against Masterson as <U+0089><db><cf>compelling<U+0089><U+06DD> and <U+0089><db><cf>overwhelming.<U+0089><U+06DD> This article has been updated with details from Lilly Yeatman<U+0089><U+06EA>s email to the husband of Victim B.

198,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/most-radical-provisions-gop-tax-bill_us_5a230f19e4b03c44072df14c","The nearly 500-page overhaul of the tax code that Republicans rammed through the Senate early Saturday morning gave lawmakers and experts little more than a moment<U+0089><U+06EA>s notice to pore over the law<U+0089><U+06EA>s myriad changes. But one thing is clear: The bill is filled with perks for America<U+0089><U+06EA>s wealthiest individuals and largest corporations, many of them paid for by closing loopholes that benefit middle-class people. By 2027, the top one-fifth of earners would receive 90 percent of the tax bill<U+0089><U+06EA>s benefits, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Here are some of the legislation<U+0089><U+06EA>s most outrageous components <U+0089><U+06E5> from giveaways for the super-rich to carve-outs for private schools. Dramatically reducing the corporate tax rate. The centerpiece of the Republican tax bill is its slashing of the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. Republicans claim this is necessary to restore American competitiveness, noting that, on paper at least, the United States has one of the highest corporate rates in the developed world. However, many large corporations are able to take advantage of deductions and loopholes that allow them to register profits overseas. This means that in practice, the average effective corporate tax rate on profit from new investments in the U.S. is 24 percent <U+0089><U+06E5> just a shade higher than the G-7 average of 21 percent. There are, of course, proponents of a lower corporate tax rate in both major political parties. Former President Barack Obama , for example, proposed lowering the top corporate rate to 28 percent as part of a revenue-neutral, comprehensive tax reform package. But without major changes in the way corporations do business,<e5><ca>a big corporate tax cut is not actually likely to result in more job creation and higher wages. Instead, it is just a windfall for the corporate executive suite that is bound to exacerbate income inequality. That<U+0089><U+06EA>s because corporate incentives are such that executives and their boards are rewarded for how much they maximize quarterly returns for big investors , not how much they invest in the long-term growth of their companies <U+0089><U+06E5> let alone how they treat their workers. As a result, Fortune 500 CEOs and their fellow decision-makers are just as likely to spend the extra cash they get from this massive tax cut on dividends and stock buybacks, rather than expanding their workforces. They have even said as much . Creating a big new tax deduction for private school tuition. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) succeeded in adding an amendment to the final bill that would expand tax-exempt 529 college savings plans to parents saving for K-12 private school tuition, as well as expenses associated with home schooling. Technically the expanded savings accounts would allow parents to amass tax-free savings for public school education as well, but it is not at all clear what major costs are incurred from a public school education. And there are no exceptions to the types of schooling eligible for the tax break, meaning that the tax code is now almost certain to subsidize private religious education. <U+0089><db><cf>By expanding choice for parents and opportunities for children, we have prioritized the education of the next generation of Americans, allowing families to save and prepare for their children<U+0089><U+06EA>s future educational expenses,<U+0089><U+06DD> Cruz said in a statement about the amendment<U+0089><U+06EA>s passage. Although the tax benefit is sure to save some families money, the ballooning cost of private elementary and secondary school makes it unlikely that it will increase access to private school for middle- and low-income kids. Average annual tuition at non-sectarian private elementary schools rose from $4,120 in 1979 to $22,611 in 2011, according to a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research released in July. It<U+0089><U+06EA>s no surprise then that in 2013, 26 percent of families in urban area with incomes in the 90th income percentile sent their kids to private school, compared to just 7 percent of families in the 50th percentile, according to NBER. In 1968, by contrast, the study said, there was a gap of just 5 percentage points in the two income groups<U+0089><U+06EA> respective rates of private school enrollment. Encouraging corporations to automate <U+0089><U+06E5> without any help for displaced workers. A provision of the tax bill would allow companies to deduct from their taxable income the entire cost of certain kinds of business investments that were previously only eligible for a 50 percent deduction. Traditionally, manufacturing firms and other infrastructure-heavy companies took advantage of the deduction to buy new factory equipment. But the increase in the deduction comes at a time when corporations are investing in automation of their production facilities through the use of robots and artificial intelligence technology, noted Robert Kovacev, a corporate tax attorney for the Steptoe & Johnson law firm in Washington, D.C. <U+0089><db><cf>It<U+0089><U+06EA>s going to accelerate spending, basically, on robots that could displace workers,<U+0089><U+06DD> Kovacev told HuffPost. Kovacev is supportive of the deduction, because automation is likely to increase productivity <U+0089><U+06E5> defined as the amount of economic output generated per work-hour. And many experts maintain that, over the long run, this type of technological disruption is a net job creator. That is likely to serve as cold comfort, however, for the mostly blue-collar workers displaced by automation in the short term. And Congress chose to speed up the automation process without any companion measures to offset the fallout for affected workers. <U+0089><db><cf>It would be a good idea to pair this with a tax incentive to encourage companies either to employ more human workers or retrain them for jobs in the new economy,<U+0089><U+06DD> Kovacev said. Some progressive lawmakers have other ideas about how to address the harm caused by automation. For example, San Francisco County Supervisor Jane Kim has explored the idea of implementing a <U+0089><U+06DD> robot tax <U+0089><U+06DD> on companies for every robot they employ to perform a job previously done by humans. The revenue raised by the tax would fund the retraining of displaced workers. Setting the stage for cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. The Republican tax bill will add $1 trillion to the national debt over a 10-year period, according to the most recent estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan congressional tax analysis body. The lack of measures to pay for the tax cuts is why Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) decided to vote against the final Senate bill, becoming the only Republican to do so. Many progressive economists believe the national debt is not a major challenge at this juncture. Interest rates on Treasury bonds remain low by historical standards. Still, once Republicans pass their budget-busting tax cuts, they frequently stoke debt fears to justify taking an ax to federal spending. They did it when Obama took office despite their overwhelming support for former President George W. Bush<U+0089><U+06EA>s tax cuts, and they have already indicated they plan to do it again. This time, though, they are coming for the three largest social insurance programs <U+0089><U+06E5> Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) was one of several Republican lawmakers to explicitly say that following the changes to the tax code, the next priority would be scaling back so-called <U+0089><db><cf>entitlement<U+0089><U+06DD> spending. <U+0089><db><cf>You also have to bring spending under control. And not discretionary spending. That isn<U+0089><U+06EA>t the driver of our debt,<U+0089><U+06DD> Rubio said last week . <U+0089><db><cf>The driver of our debt is the structure of Social Security and Medicare for future beneficiaries.<U+0089><U+06DD> Rejecting a proposal to expand a tax credit for families with children in order to reduce the corporate tax rate even more. Rubio and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) wanted to add an amendment to the tax bill that would have modestly expanded the Child Tax Credit, which is effectively a cash benefit for low-income working families with children. The latest version of the change would have provided some 10 million families with about $75 more per year , according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. To pay for the roughly $87 billion price of expanding the tax credit, Rubio and Lee proposed reducing the top corporate tax rate to just under 21 percent, rather than the 20 percent threshold that President Donald Trump and GOP leaders were seeking. The amendment collapsed in a 71-29 vote with just 20 Republicans and nine Democrats voting for it. Most Republicans objected to the amendment on the grounds that the corporate rate needed to drop to 20 percent. Democrats declined to rally behind it, because they argued that the tax credit was far too small to provide meaningful help to vulnerable people and that GOP leaders would ultimately strip it out in conference committee regardless. All but eliminating the estate tax for the country<U+0089><U+06EA>s wealthiest households. Under the Senate bill, an even tinier sliver of households in the country would be subject to the estate tax levied on the assets that ultra-rich individuals leave to their heirs when they die. Currently, $11 million in assets are exempt from the estate tax, ensuring that it falls on just 0.2 percent of American households with taxable assets. While the top statutory estate tax rate is 40 percent, the average effective rate paid by families subject to the tax is about 17 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center . The tax nonetheless serves as a major source of revenue for the federal government and achieves the additional goal of modestly limiting intergenerational wealth transfers, which some experts believe undermine meritocracy and social mobility. The Senate bill would double the estate tax exemption to $22 million for couples, eliminating the tax entirely for half the estates that currently pay it, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities . Those households still subject to the tax would get a $4.4 million tax cut, which CBPP points out would be enough to provide Pell grants to fund college tuition for 1,100 low- and moderate-income students. The bill Republicans passed in the House gets rid of the estate tax entirely over time.",1,48.84,12,14.2,1647,74,"Here Are 6 Of The Most Radical Aspects Of The GOP Tax Bill",2017-12-02 17:16:00,"Daniel Marans","Politics","@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@sponsor_msnbcpolitics,@team_us_enterprise_politics,accounting,barack-obama,bob-corker,center-on-budget-and-policy-priorities,centers-for-medicare-and-medicaid-services,child-tax-credit,college-financing,democratic-party,george-w-bush,household-finance,k-6-education,legal-issues,marco-rubio,medicare,microeconomics,mike-lee,personal-debt,personal-taxes,political-science,republican-party,republican-politics,senate,social-security,tax-policy-center,ted-cruz,the-republican,type: news,united-states,us-congressional-elections,us-government-resources,us-news,us-presidential-elections",611529,522748,611529,665412,69104,209897,1.11,1.259,2.151,2.412,153095,390313,68121,144824,234336,33602,43103,123338,118041,4954,102,101,29704,29136,210,247,111,"Here Are 6 Of The Most Radical Aspects Of The GOP Tax Bill",2017-12-02 17:16:00,"Daniel Marans","Politics","@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@sponsor_msnbcpolitics,@team_us_enterprise_politics,accounting,barack-obama,bob-corker,center-on-budget-and-policy-priorities,centers-for-medicare-and-medicaid-services,child-tax-credit,college-financing,democratic-party,george-w-bush,household-finance,k-6-education,legal-issues,marco-rubio,medicare,microeconomics,mike-lee,personal-debt,personal-taxes,political-science,republican-party,republican-politics,senate,social-security,tax-policy-center,ted-cruz,the-republican,type: news,united-states,us-congressional-elections,us-government-resources,us-news,us-presidential-elections",611529,522748,611529,665412,69104,209897,1.11,1.259,2.151,2.412,153095,390313,68121,144824,234336,33602,43103,123338,118041,4954,102,101,29704,29136,210,247,111

Bush<U+0089><U+06EA>s administration. Later on Sunday evening, Trump issued another, similar tweet thanking no one in particular. Although Hurricane Harvey has been downgraded to a tropical storm, heavy rainfall from it is expected to last for days and the Houston area braced for the prospect of catastrophic flooding . The National Weather Service reported at least five fatalities in the region. According to Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s weekend schedule, he has been monitoring the storm from his Camp David retreat, receiving regular updates from authorities.<e5><ca>But it was clear from his tweets that Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s priorities were not entirely on the disaster. On Sunday, Trump announced via Twitter that he would visit Texas <U+0089><db><cf>as soon as that trip can be made without causing disruption.<U+0089><U+06DD><e5><ca>Yet he immediately tweeted that he would also visit Missouri. He bragged that Missouri is <U+0089><db><cf>a wonderful state...that I won by a lot<U+0089><U+06DD> in the 2016 election, and he politicized the visit by predicting that a Republican would defeat its Democratic U.S. senator, Claire McCaskill, who is up for re-election next year. Among Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s other missives on Sunday morning: reiterating that Mexico would provide reimbursements for his long-promised border wall and charging that Mexico and Canada are <U+0089><db><cf>being very difficult<U+0089><U+06DD> in negotiations to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement. He also asserted that NAFTA was the <U+0089><db><cf>worst trade deal ever made<U+0089><U+06DD>. He even found time to plug a book by ardent supporter David Clarke, the sheriff of Milwaukee County who runs a jail where the deaths last year of four persons <U+0089><U+06E5> including a newborn <U+0089><U+06E5> have raised concerns about its operations. On Friday evening, while Hurricane Harvey was about to make landfall, Trump used the opportunity to unleash a storm of other news , spurring questions about whether he deliberately timed the actions to keep the spotlight off them. He quietly issued a memo outlining guidance on enforcing his decision to ban transgender people from serving in the military.

Those events appear in a video filmed two weeks ago by a volunteer with the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia and published by the civil rights group on Saturday. As seen in the footage below, a man in a blue sleeveless shirt, a green vest and a bandana on his head pulls out a gun and aims it at a counterprotester, who is off camera and appears to be holding a makeshift lit torch. The first man appears to yell a racial slur at the black man, then fires the gun toward the ground in the direction of the counterprotesters. The shooter then leaves the scene by joining a line of white supremacist protesters and walking past law enforcement officers, who were standing behind metal barricades about 10 feet away .

Two other arrests were made in connection with another violent crime caught on video that took place during the rally. Police arrested Daniel Patrick Borden, 18, and Alex Michael Ramos, 33, in connection with the beating of Deandre Harris , a black 20-year-old who was protesting the white supremacy rally. A mob of white supremacists beat Harris with metal poles in a parking lot near police headquarters during the rally, leaving Harris bloodied, with a broken wrist, deep gashes to the head and a chipped tooth.

The scrapped provision would have required employers to report aggregate information on how much they pay workers <U+0089><U+06E5> broken down by gender, race and ethnicity <U+0089><U+06E5> and would have been a critical first step in figuring out the scope of the pay gap at different companies. Instead, the Office of Management and Budget said in a memo this week that it was halting implementation so it could review the provision, citing concerns about paperwork and privacy. Ivanka Trump , who speaks frequently about the importance of equal pay for women and who promised last summer that her father feels similarly, issued a statement supporting the move. <U+0089><db><cf>Ultimately, while I believe the intention was good and agree that pay transparency is important, the proposed policy would not yield the intended results,<U+0089><U+06DD> Trump said on Tuesday. <U+0089><db><cf>We look forward to continuing to work with [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission], [the Office of Management and Budget], Congress and all relevant stakeholders on robust policies aimed at eliminating the gender wage gap.<U+0089><U+06DD> She offered no further explanation for the administration<U+0089><U+06EA>s action or her endorsement of it. Women<U+0089><U+06EA>s groups universally decried the move. <U+0089><db><cf>This is not a technical tweak as they would have you believe. Make no mistake<U+0089><db><d3> it<U+0089><U+06EA>s an all-out attack on equal pay,<U+0089><U+06DD> Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women<U+0089><U+06EA>s Law Center, said in a statement on Tuesday. <U+0089><db><cf>Today<U+0089><U+06EA>s action sends a clear message to employers,<U+0089><U+06DD> Graves added. <U+0089><db><cf>If you want to ignore pay inequities and sweep them under the rug, this Administration has your back.<U+0089><U+06DD> They also took aim at the president<U+0089><U+06EA>s eldest daughter for betraying her purported commitment to working women. <U+0089><db><cf>For somebody who has long held herself out as a champion for women and for gender equality, it<U+0089><U+06EA>s really disappointing,<U+0089><U+06DD> Vicki Shabo, vice president for workplace policy and strategy at the National Partnership for Women and Families, told HuffPost on Wednesday. <U+0089><db><cf>[This] spits in the eye of gender equality and in the eyes of women and people of color who are so often paid less and do not know.<U+0089><U+06DD> On average, women in the U.S. are paid 80 cents for every dollar men earn, according to federal data. The pay gap for women of color is even worse. Hispanic women earn 54 cents on the dollar, while black women make 63 cents.<e5><ca>Even when researchers analyze the data and account for differences in education and time spent in the labor force, the wage gap persists. Interestingly, Ivanka Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s book, a bland treatise called Women Who Work , mentions the term <U+0089><db><cf>equal pay<U+0089><U+06DD> only once, focusing more on individual moves women can make to achieve success in the workplace. <U+0089><db><cf>When you<U+0089><U+06EA>re passionate and work hard you can achieve great things,<U+0089><U+06DD> she writes. But even when a woman is going full-steam ahead at work, she may not realize that her male peers are out-earning her. After 19 years as a manager at a Goodyear plant in Alabama, Lilly Ledbetter famously found out she had been making less than her male colleagues after someone sent her an anonymous note. Her lawsuit led to the passage of equal pay legislation in 2009. Employers are now required to report information about the race, ethnicity and gender of their employees. Starting a few years ago, tech companies have made their Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reports public, which has led to a painful <U+0089><U+06E5> but fruitful <U+0089><U+06E5> discussion about the lack of women in the tech industry. It<U+0089><U+06EA>s easy to imagine how pay data would<U+0089><U+06EA>ve advanced the conversation even further and made it easier for federal regulators to spot patterns of discrimination. <U+0089><db><cf>Having pay data in summary form will help us identify patterns that may warrant further investigation,<U+0089><U+06DD> the former chairwoman of the EEOC said last year at a conference in New York. In the past, she said, <U+0089><db><cf>we<U+0089><U+06EA>d learn about a pay-discrimination problem because someone saw a piece of paper left on a copy machine or someone was complaining about their salary to co-workers.<U+0089><U+06DD> Companies with more than 100 workers were set to receive a new form to report the data in September and start providing more detailed information to the EEOC in 2018. Most employers were already preparing to file this data, according to Shabo. Indeed, in recent years, activist shareholders have been pressuring public companies to report data <U+0089><U+06E5> a few companies, including Apple and Amazon, have started opening up about gender and pay. Stopping the Obama administration provision from going into effect was the result of an orchestrated effort by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the federal contractors business lobby and anti-worker and anti-regulatory senators on the Hill, Shabo said. It<U+0089><U+06EA>s even more disappointing because the provision already represented a compromised effort, she added. <U+0089><db><cf>It wasn<U+0089><U+06EA>t as comprehensive or as detailed as we would<U+0089><U+06EA>ve liked.

Kory Langhofer, counsel to the transition team known as Trump for America, Inc., wrote a letter to congressional committees to say Special Counsel Robert Mueller<U+0089><U+06EA>s team had improperly received the emails from the General Services Administration, a government agency.

The Trump team<U+0089><U+06EA>s accusation adds to the growing friction between the president<U+0089><U+06EA>s supporters and Mueller<U+0089><U+06EA>s office as it investigates whether Russia interfered in the election and if Trump or anyone on his team colluded with Moscow.

On Friday, Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said he fears the committee<U+0089><U+06EA>s Republican majority intends to close its investigation of the topic prematurely. Some Republicans have argued that Mueller is biased against Trump and should be fired. The letter was sent to the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, and the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. It asked for Congress to act immediately <U+0089><db><cf>to protect future presidential transitions from having their private records misappropriated by government agencies, particularly in the context of sensitive investigations intersecting with political motives.<U+0089><U+06DD> The letter said Mueller<U+0089><U+06EA>s office obtained the emails despite the fact that it was aware the GSA did not own or control the records. It said the special counsel<U+0089><U+06EA>s office has <U+0089><db><cf>extensively used the materials in question, including portions that are susceptible to claims of privilege<U+0089><U+06DD> without notifying the Trump for America team. On the transition team were a number of aides who were later caught up in Mueller<U+0089><U+06EA>s investigation, such as former national security adviser Michael Flynn who pleaded guilty this month to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia. Langhofer, the Trump transition team lawyer, wrote in his letter that the GSA<U+0089><U+06EA>s transfer of materials was discovered on Dec. 12 and 13. The FBI had requested the materials from GSA staff last Aug. 23, asking for copies of the emails, laptops, cell phones and other materials associated with nine members of the Trump transition team response for national security and policy matters, the letter said. On Aug. 30, the FBI requested the materials of four additional senior members of the Trump transition team, it said. Langhofer argued that while such transition teams are involved in executive functions, they are considered private, nonprofit organizations whose records are private and not subject to presidential records laws.

At one point a car plowed into an anti-racist group amid clashes between white supremacist activists, some armed, and anti-fascist protesters. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) declared a state of emergency on Saturday afternoon. President Donald Trump blamed <U+0089><db><cf>many sides<U+0089><U+06DD> for the unrest.

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. <U+0089><U+06E5> Thousands of white supremacists and armed militia groups faced off with counter-protesters during a violent and chaotic rally that raged for hours in this Virginia city on Saturday, resulting in the deaths of at least three people. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), who declared a state of emergency Saturday afternoon, condemned the violence during a press conference that evening, sending a message to the white supremacists. <U+0089><db><cf>Our message is plain and simple: Go home.

Charlottesville Police Chief Al Thomas said 35 people were treated for injuries by city personnel on Saturday, with injuries ranging from minor to life-threatening. Three people died Saturday, including a 32-year-old woman who was hit by a car that plowed into a group of counter-demonstrators and two others who perished in a helicopter crash near the protests. James Alex Fields Jr., 20, was arrested in connection with the car incident. He was charged with one count of second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of failing to stop at an accident resulting in a death, police Col.

Counter-demonstrators and anti-fascist groups also attended. After demonstrations got heated Friday night, tensions were running high even before the rally officially began at noon, with members of the <U+0089><db><cf>alt-right<U+0089><U+06DD> chanting the Nazi phrase <U+0089><db><cf>Blood and soil!<U+0089><U+06DD> and <U+0089><db><cf>White lives matter!<U+0089><U+06DD> as they marched toward Emancipation Park.

As violence among the groups grew on Saturday morning, some fled the scene, while others coughed and cried from the chemical sprays. Two fences and a line of cops helped separate the opposing groups, though police did not immediately intervene in the violence. Police donned riot gear as fights escalated. Meanwhile, hundreds more white supremacists joined in the fray through the afternoon, making their way under a banner hung by the city that read <U+0089><db><cf>Diversity makes us stronger.<U+0089><U+06DD> Those standing on the sidelines were baffled as to why police weren<U+0089><U+06EA>t immediately stopping the skirmishes. <U+0089><db><cf>If this were Ferguson, riot gear, tear gas, everything would have been used,<U+0089><U+06DD> said Anthony Bennett, a pastor from Connecticut, referring to the Missouri town where protests broke out in August 2014 after Darren Wilson, at the time a police officer, shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager. <U+0089><db><cf>There<U+0089><U+06EA>s a different standard here in Charlottesville.<U+0089><U+06DD> Unidentified militia members brandishing guns also showed up at the scene.

Eventually, arrests began. Late Friday night, a white nationalist march at the University of Virginia campus painted a sobering picture of what was to come. A torch-bearing procession of hundreds that included Spencer, at least one man wearing a Nazi SS T-shirt and another carrying a bat,<e5><ca>ended with a clash at the campus rotunda where a Thomas Jefferson statue stands. Spencer admitted on Twitter that a group surrounded counter-protesters at the statue. Counter-protesters told HuffPost that some among their ranks were then hit with some type of irritant Friday night <U+0089><U+06E5> they claim it was Mace, unleashed by the white supremacists.<e5><ca>Protesters on the fringe left, who come to these events to battle the fringe right, often try to hide their identities for fear of retaliation. Some counter-protesters threatened a HuffPost reporter with a gun when he attempted to photograph, from a distance, those recovering from the irritant. <U+0089><db><cf>Don<U+0089><U+06EA>t make me use my gun on you,<U+0089><U+06DD> a woman said, grabbing a holster on her hip. Punches and torches were thrown during the fracas, but local police eventually dispersed the crowds. President Donald Trump did little to denounce the white supremacists, instead saying Saturday that <U+0089><db><cf>many sides<U+0089><U+06DD> were responsible for the violence. <U+0089><db><cf>We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides <U+0089><U+06E5> on many sides,<U+0089><U+06DD> Trump said at a ceremony for the signing of a bill to reform the Veterans Affairs health care system. <U+0089><db><cf>It<U+0089><U+06EA>s been going on for a long time in our country, not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama. It<U+0089><U+06EA>s been going on for a long, long time.<U+0089><U+06DD> Comments from state and local officials addressed the racism more directly. Charlottesville Mayor Michael Signer spoke out against the white supremacists who gathered in his city. <U+0089><db><cf>They do not agree with the rules of democracy and they are on the losing side of history,<U+0089><U+06DD> he said during a press conference Saturday evening. McAuliffe spoke directly to white supremacists during the press conference, reminding them that <U+0089><db><cf>we are a nation of immigrants.<U+0089><U+06DD> McAuliffe said he spoke to Trump on Saturday and told the president he<U+0089><U+06EA>d be willing to work together, despite their differences, to help prevent this kind of violence in the future. <U+0089><db><cf>There has got to be a movement in this country to bring people together,<U+0089><U+06DD> McAuliffe said. The rally Saturday was thinly disguised on Facebook as an event in support of the statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee downtown, which is slated for removal as the city works to respect diverse voices in its telling of American history. It<U+0089><U+06EA>s part of a nationwide effort to remove Confederate monuments from public property. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, more than 60 Confederate symbols have been removed from city- and state-owned land across the U.S. since avowed white supremacist Dylann Roof massacred nine parishioners at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. Most recently, the city of New Orleans toppled four statues honoring the Confederacy. <U+0089><db><cf>These efforts have made us a target for folks around the country who oppose telling the full story of race,<U+0089><U+06DD> Signer told HuffPost on Friday. <U+0089><db><cf>They don<U+0089><U+06EA>t want the narrative changed or to tell the full story of race. I think this will have the effect of redoubling our progress.<e5><ca>To become an honest society, I don<U+0089><U+06EA>t think we have any choice but to tell the full story.<U+0089><U+06DD> The rally<U+0089><U+06EA>s real purpose, however, shines through in the event<U+0089><U+06EA>s advertising, which looks a lot like Nazi propaganda and reads like a poorly billed concert: Spencer<U+0089><U+06EA>s followers claimed that that violence was coming to Charlottesville in the form of <U+0089><db><cf>roving mobs<U+0089><U+06DD> of Antifa <U+0089><U+06E5> groups of black-clad, masked anti-fascists, anarchists and socialists. It<U+0089><U+06EA>s a scare tactic that white nationalists use regularly to pull crowds of people to a city in defense of it. They were able to draw hundreds to Gettysburg over the Fourth of July weekend after claiming members of Antifa were coming to desecrate graves. Antifa never came, but the Ku Klux Klan did, and the only bloodshed came when a lone patriot shot himself in the leg . The weeks and days leading up to the rally in Charlottesville had the city gearing up for war. The city had seen this type of menacing before: White supremacists showed up with torches at the Lee monument in May, an act that evoked Ku Klux Klan symbolism. Some businesses closed down Saturday to keep employees safe. Others reportedly opened their doors solely as a safe space in case of an emergency. Some locals were prepared to take drastic measures to protect their city. <U+0089><db><cf>As a lifelong resident of Charlottesville and a mother of two, this is about making the world more equitable for my children,<U+0089><U+06DD> Leslie Scott-Jones of Solidarity C<U+0089><U+06EA>Ville wrote in a news release. <U+0089><db><cf>I am not naive about the urgent threat of August 12 , nor do I believe the threat ends there...

Mueller has asked Deutsche Bank to share information on accounts held by the Trump family as part of his investigation into Russia<U+0089><U+06EA>s alleged attempts to influence the 2016 election,<e5><ca>Reuters reported Tuesday. The bank has loaned the Trump Organization millions of dollars over the years. Trump does not like revealing details of his finances. He still hasn<U+0089><U+06EA>t released his tax returns, unlike other presidents in recent history. And in July, Trump implied that he would consider firing Mueller if he started looking into his finances. From his interview with New York Times reporters Peter Baker, Michael S.

The White House did not immediately return a request for comment. Trump has reportedly considered firing Mueller in the past.

According to the network, the charges are sealed under a federal judge<U+0089><U+06EA>s order. It remains unclear who has been indicted and on what charges. The person or persons indicted could be taken into custody as soon as Monday, CNN said.

Since then, reports have emerged that Mueller was investigating whether Trump attempted to obstruct justice. Mueller<U+0089><U+06EA>s team is reportedly also looking into a dossier containing explosive, unverified allegations regarding Trump and his associates, compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele for the research firm Fusion GPS.

The team is reportedly looking into possible tax and financial crimes by Paul Manafort.<e5><ca>Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s former campaign manager was forced out in August 2016 over his past business dealings with pro-Russian figures in Ukraine.

In doing so, he bypassed the Department of Justice<U+0089><U+06EA>s normal pardon procedures. (Trump reportedly asked his attorney general about closing the criminal case against Arpaio months earlier.) On Sunday, as residents of Texas began evaluating the flooding and damage from the storm, Trump issued a stream of tweets congratulating authorities and himself for the recovery effort, which he bragged was<e5><U+0289><db><cf>going well!<U+0089><U+06DD> The tweets about Hurricane Harvey were sandwiched between posts on unrelated topics, including the president<U+0089><U+06EA>s personal grievances .

At least one woman, who is not a Morgan Stanley employee but interacted with Ford in a professional capacity, was interviewed by Morgan Stanley<U+0089><U+06EA>s HR department as part of the investigation. In two interviews with HuffPost, the woman alleged that Ford engaged in harassment, intimidation, and forcibly grabbed her one evening in Manhattan, leading her to seek aid from a building security guard. The incident took place several years ago when Ford and the woman were supposed to be meeting for professional reasons. Ford continued to contact her after the encounter until she wrote an email asking him to cease contact. The email, which was reviewed by HuffPost, shows that the woman emailed Ford after he repeatedly asked her to drinks. She asked him not to contact her anymore, citing his inappropriate conduct the evening where he forcibly grabbed and harassed her. Ford replied to the email by apologizing and agreeing not to contact her. <U+0089><db><cf>Hey very sorry. Meant no harm,<U+0089><U+06DD> the email reads. <U+0089><db><cf>And I apologize for whatever I may have said or what was said. And my overtures are strictly professional.

One woman heard from Ford<U+0089><U+06EA>s accuser the night of the incident and described her as <U+0089><db><cf>distraught, shocked, and frightened,<U+0089><U+06DD> and said that she was concerned about any career ramifications should she report the incident. In a statement provided to HuffPost, Ford denied the allegations: <U+0089><db><cf>This simply did not happen. I have never forcibly grabbed any woman or man in my life. Having drinks and dinner for work is part of my job,<e5><ca>and all of my outreach to the news reporter making these false allegations was professional and at the direction of my firm for business purposes. I support and have tremendous respect for the brave women now speaking out in this important national dialogue. False claims like this undermine the real silence breakers.

Ford lost that hotly contested 2006 race by fewer than three points to current Republican Sen. Bob Corker.

President Andrew Jackson added the southern magnolia tree to the White House grounds in honor of his late wife. But the tree has decayed to a point where it can no longer be safely preserved, CNN reports. Stephanie Grisham,<e5><ca>Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s spokeswoman,<e5><ca>told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the first lady discussed options with White House staff and reviewed an analysis by the United States National Arboretum before deeming that the tree was a safety risk. <U+0089><db><cf>[Melania Trump]<e5><ca>trusted that every effort had been made to preserve the historic tree, and was concerned about the safety of visitors and members of the press who are often standing right in front of the tree during Marine One lifts,<U+0089><U+06DD><e5><ca>Grisham told the AP. Grisham said that a <U+0089><db><cf>large portion<U+0089><U+06DD> of the tree will be removed later this week.<e5><ca> Wood and seedlings from the tree will reportedly be preserved for the future. The Jackson Magnolia, also known as a magnolia grandiflora tree, was Andrew Jackson<U+0089><U+06EA>s tribute to wife Rachel Jackson. The pair fell in love and attempted to get married while Rachel was still legally married to her former husband , a situation that caused a scandal during the presidential campaign of 1828. Rachel<U+0089><U+06EA>s health began to decline as Jackson<U+0089><U+06EA>s political career progressed,<e5><ca>and her existing medical issues were compounded by personal attacks during the campaign on her marriage and virtue. Rachel died on December 22, 1828, days after her husband was elected as president. Jackson, who blamed his political enemies for his wife<U+0089><U+06EA>s death, moved into the White House as a widower. He reportedly asked for a sprout from Rachel<U+0089><U+06EA>s favorite magnolia tree at the couple<U+0089><U+06EA>s farm in Tennessee to be planted on the White House grounds. It was placed at the west side of the South Portico in 1835, according to the White House Historical Association. A second magnolia tree was later planted on the east side of the Portico, for symmetry. Since its arrival, the tree has been in the backdrop of many events at the White House <U+0089><U+06E5> from Easter Egg Rolls to routine Marine One departures. Seedlings from the tree have also been used as gifts. President Obama gifted a seedling from the tree to the Israeli people during a trip to former Israeli president Shimon Peres<U+0089><U+06EA> presidential residence in 2013. The Jackson Magnolia started to experience problems in the 1970s, when new trunks, or <U+0089><db><cf>leaders,<U+0089><U+06DD><e5><ca>began to emerge from its base. Cement was later used to help shore up a cavity in the tree, which ended up causing more harm. The tree is now standing up with the help of a pole and cable system. According to a report obtained by CNN , experts at the Arboretum told Trump that this system can no longer prevent the tree from collapsing <U+0089><U+06E5> and that the tree may actually be a safety hazard. <U+0089><db><cf>If this was any ordinary tree, it would have been removed long ago,<U+0089><U+06DD> the report from the Arboretum reads. <U+0089><db><cf>We understand this is a historic tree, and all measures have been used to save it to this point in time.

His response <U+0089><U+06E5> which followed that of his wife, Melania, the first from the White House to comment on the protests <U+0089><U+06E5> was a rebuke of hatred<e5><U+0289><db><cf> on many sides .<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><cf>We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides <U+0089><U+06E5> on many sides,<U+0089><U+06DD> Trump said at a ceremony for the signing of a bill to reform the Veterans Affairs health care system. <U+0089><db><cf>It<U+0089><U+06EA>s been going on for a long time in our country, not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama.

220,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/robert-mueller-grand-jury-russia-probe_us_59837b30e4b0cb15b1bd6508","Special counsel Robert Mueller has impaneled a grand jury as part of his investigation into possible collusion between President Donald Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s campaign and Russia in last year<U+0089><U+06EA>s election, sources tell the Wall Street Journal . The report follows Mueller stepping up the probe by hiring several high-powered lawyers. Reuters reported earlier this week that Greg Andres , a former Justice Department attorney who specialized in corruption and bribery cases, joined the investigation. Grand jury subpoenas related to a meeting attended by Trump Jr., the president<U+0089><U+06EA>s eldest son, and a Russian lawyer have been issued, sources told Reuters . Trump Jr. agreed to the meeting after being promised information that would <U+0089><db><cf>incriminate<U+0089><U+06DD> his father<U+0089><U+06EA>s opponent, Hillary Clinton, and was part of the Russian government<U+0089><U+06EA>s effort to benefit Trump. A source familiar with the matter told Reuters that Mueller was investigating whether anyone at the meeting or affiliated with the Trump campaign encouraged Russia to release damaging material it had collected on Clinton. Another told the outlet that Mueller was trying to determine if Trump had been informed of the meeting ahead of time, or if he was briefed after it took place. The president has strongly denied having had any knowledge of the meeting, but has not faulted his son for attending it. Mueller<U+0089><U+06EA>s probe is one of several government investigations into possible collusion. He is also investigating whether Trump obstructed justice. Read the full Wall Street Journal story here . Assembling a grand jury marks a major step, as it suggests an aggressive and prolonged investigation. Grand juries can be used as legal tools in cases when there is the possibility of criminal conduct , legal experts say. The grand jury, which will be based in Washington, D.C., does not necessarily signify that criminal charges will be brought. But it means it can hear testimony from witnesses under oath, and that the investigation can issue subpoenas to obtain documents. Trump has criticized the investigation as <U+0089><db><cf>a witch hunt,<U+0089><U+06DD> and hinted at removing Mueller. Meanwhile, there has been bipartisan support for legislation to protect Mueller from being fired by Trump . Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller in May, after Trump fired then-FBI Director James Comey amid the agency<U+0089><U+06EA>s investigation into Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s campaign. According to Comey, Trump had told Comey to pledge his loyalty to him, undermining the independence of the FBI. He also asked Comey to lay off the FBI<U+0089><U+06EA>s investigation into former national security adviser Mike Flynn, who lied about his contacts with Russian officials. Last month, in an interview with The New York Times, Trump warned Mueller to not investigate his finances. Soon after, several sources reported that Mueller had begun including Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s finances as part of the probe . White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Thursday in a statement that Trump himself was not under investigation. She referred to Ty Cobb, a member of Trump<U+0089><U+06EA>s outside legal team representing him in the Russia investigations. Ty Cobb, special counsel to the president, said he wasn<U+0089><U+06EA>t aware that Mr. Mueller had started using a new grand jury. <U+0089><db><cf>Grand jury matters are typically secret,<U+0089><U+06DD> Mr. Cobb said. <U+0089><db><cf>The White House favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly....The White House is committed to fully cooperating with Mr. Mueller.<U+0089><U+06DD> Former FBI Director Jim Comey said three times the President is not under investigation and we have no reason to believe that has changed.

At issue is the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, which was signed into law by former President Ronald Reagan in 1986. It was a congressional response to stories of<e5><U+0289><db><cf>patient dumping<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><U+06E5> hospitals would deny treatment to patients or send them elsewhere , usually because the individuals didn<U+0089><U+06EA>t have insurance. Many of these patients were unemployed or were people of color. Those transferred individuals were more likely to die, and the delayed care often jeopardized the patients<U+0089><U+06EA> health. The law put a particular focus on pregnant women (hence <U+0089><db><cf>active labor<U+0089><U+06DD> in the law<U+0089><U+06EA>s name), to ensure that they would be able to deliver their babies and receive full care. Changing the law, as Black advocates, would send America back to a time when hospitals can use their discretion to turn people away. <U+0089><db><cf>We must treat everybody that walks in whether you<U+0089><U+06EA>ve had a sore throat for a week, we must see them. And that crowds the emergency room. It drives the cost of emergencies up,<U+0089><U+06DD> Black added on MSNBC. <U+0089><db><cf>And so, yes, if someone comes in from an auto accident, I don<U+0089><U+06EA>t want to ask whether they have insurance or not. I<U+0089><U+06EA>m going to take care of them.<U+0089><U+06DD> <U+0089><db><cf>But what it did is crowd my emergency room, where I work,<U+0089><U+06DD> she added. <U+0089><db><cf>And disallowed me from using my good judgment skills, of which I was trained to do and doctors are as well. And the federal government said, you must <U+0089><U+06E5> and you can<U+0089><U+06EA>t make those decisions. And I think that was a poor thing for us to do.<U+0089><U+06DD> This free-for-all system would not be unlike what happened before Obamacare, when there were fewer requirements for insurance companies to accept people for coverage. It was a time when insurance providers were free to turn people away because they had more expensive pre-existing conditions <U+0089><U+06E5> or were labeled as potentially having an expensive condition down the line. And since these companies were free to do so, they did. Nobody thinks EMTALA is perfect and non-partisan organizations, including the Institute of Medicine , have long called for revising some of the law<U+0089><U+06EA>s regulations as part of a broader strategy to ease emergency room overcrowding. And although conservatives have been among the most critical of the law, even the Heritage Foundation admits that <U+0089><db><cf>the outright repeal of EMTALA is highly unlikely ,<U+0089><U+06DD> and it<U+0089><U+06EA>s not something you hear talked about much in health care debates.

Trump, who visited Texas twice in the days following Hurricane Harvey and headed to Florida four days after Hurricane Irma, said last week that he was delaying a visit to Puerto Rico <U+0089><db><cf>because of the first responders, and we don<U+0089><U+06EA>t want to disrupt the relief efforts.<U+0089><U+06DD> Tensions were high ahead of the president<U+0089><U+06EA>s visit.

In truth, conditions in Puerto Rico remain dire. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has shipped millions of gallons of water and meals to Puerto Rico, but the island no longer has the infrastructure to widely deliver those supplies. Puerto Rican officials said last week that they were unable to move aid across the island without electricity and fuel. Until last week, shipments to the island were also restricted by the Jones Act , a law that increases shipping costs for goods going to Puerto Rico. Trump allowed a temporary waiver of the law last Thursday. As of Monday, all 10 of Puerto Rico<U+0089><U+06EA>s airports were open, and about 37 percent of people had cellphone service, according to the Department of Defense. Two Navy ships are due to arrive Tuesday with more supplies. Still, almost all of Puerto Rico is without electricity ,<e5><ca>and about half the population lacks drinking water.

228,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-ignores-don-jr-russia-meeting_us_596469f0e4b005b0fdc7d190","President Donald Trump was notably silent about his eldest son on Twitter Tuesday following a string of shocking reports that revealed how Donald Trump Jr. had met with a Russian lawyer in hopes of gaining damning information about 2016 presidential election rival Hillary Clinton. Trump tweeted about Senate Democrats, but failed to comment on The New York Times latest report, which said Don Jr. was informed in advance that the intel he would receive at the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya was actually gathered by the Russian government to help elect his father. Mark Corallo, the spokesman for the presidents personal lawyer, told The New York Times on Sunday that the president  was not aware of and did not attend the meeting with Veselnitskaya, a move some saw as an early effort to distance the White House from Don Jr., who does not serve in any official capacity in his fathers administration. He and his brother Eric run the Trump organization . The president has not personally responded to the growing controversy surrounding his sons meeting last year with Veselnitskaya and has no public events on his schedule for the second day in a row.Last weekend, the Times reported that the younger Trump met with Veselnitskaya alongside the presidents son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort to obtain information that would help the campaign against Clinton. Don Jr. hit back at the latest Times report on Tuesday, calling the meeting nonsense. On Monday, the Times revealed that Don Jr. was informed via email ahead of the meeting that the promised intel was linked to the Russian government and its attempts to sway the election in his fathers favor. U.S. intelligence agencies have all agreed that Russia, under the direction of President Vladimir Putin, actively worked on an influence campaign to help Trump get elected. At the G-20 summit last weekend, Putin denied any involvement in such machinations. Trump has rushed to defend almost any member of his inner circle, at least initially, who was subject to less than stellar media coverage, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn , his daughter Ivanka , his ultra-rich Cabinet officials and his attorney general, Jeff Sessions . Trumps decision to let Don Jr. defend himself was a notable departure in his efforts to protect his squadron of trusted confidants. In a statement provided to HuffPost, Don Jr.s lawyer, Alan Futerfas, also said the president knew nothing about the meeting, calling it much ado about nothing. Don Jr.s takeaway from this communication was that someone had information potentially helpful to the campaign and it was coming from someone he knew, Futerfas said in the statement, which was first provided to The Times. Don Jr. had no knowledge as to what specific information, if any, would be discussed. Further, at no time was there ever any understanding or commitment that he, or anyone else, would find the information, whatever it turned out to be, to be reliable, credible or of interest, or would even survive due diligence. The meeting lasted about 20-30 minutes, and nothing came of it. His father knew nothing about it. The bottom line is that Don, Jr. did nothing wrong. Don Jr. has admitted that he met with Veselnitskaya (in two separate, but differing statements ), but said she was vague, ambiguous and made no sense. He claimed the conversation quickly turned to an obscure American law called the Magnitsky Act <U+2015> It became clear to me that this was the true agenda all along, he said <U+2015> before he ended the meeting. The 2012 act allowed the U.S. to withhold visas and freeze Russian assets. In retaliation, the Kremlin halted U.S. adoptions of Russian babies. Legal experts said Mondays revelations about Don Jr. knowing that the intel he received from Veselnitskaya actually came from the Russian government were notable. Taking the meeting itself may have been illegal as the U.S. has very specific campaign finance provisions which prohibit contributions from foreign nationals to aid an election.",1,61.26,9.3,11.8,663,36,"Trump Ignores Revelations About Don Jr.'s Meeting With Russian Lawyer",2017-07-11 07:22:00,"Nick Visser","Politics","@genassign,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_ga,donald-trump,donald-trump-jr,international-news,republican-politics,trump-organization,type: news,us-news,us-presidential-elections",313223,284676,313223,351496,37625,235686,1.066,1.112,1.14,1.308,167134,115993,30096,5358,268187,1107,7124,9145,8834,279,NA,5,4822,4704,93,1,24,"Trump Ignores Revelations About Don Jr.'s Meeting With Russian Lawyer",2017-07-11 07:22:00,"Nick Visser","Politics","@genassign,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_ga,donald-trump,donald-trump-jr,international-news,republican-politics,trump-organization,type: news,us-news,us-presidential-elections",313223,284676,313223,351496,37625,235686,1.066,1.112,1.14,1.308,167134,115993,30096,5358,268187,1107,7124,9145,8834,279,NA,5,4822,4704,93,1,24

NBC News published a piece alleging that he made the request over the summer after seeing a slide displaying the reduction in American nuclear weaponry since the 1960s. According to the officials present, Trumps advisers, among them the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, were surprised, the NBC piece says. Officials briefly explained the legal and practical impediments to a nuclear buildup and how the current military posture is stronger than it was at the height of the buildup. In interviews, they told NBC News that no such expansion is planned. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis on Wednesday called the reports absolutely false. Recent reports that the president called for an increase in the U.S. nuclear arsenal are absolutely false. This kind of erroneous reporting is irresponsible, Mattis said in a statement. Trump also threatened NBC that he would  challenge their license , although what that would entail specifically is unclear.The Federal Communications Commission, the body that oversees licensing, didnt immediately respond to a request for comment, but its website notes that it doesnt oversee television or radio networks . Trumps tirade against the network ramped up last week after NBC reporters nabbed a scoop claiming that Tillerson called him a  moron  and threatened to not return to Washington, D.C., while he was visiting Texas. Tillerson ended up making on-camera remarks the same day following rumors that the piece was an indication that he planned to resign. He didnt deny having made the comment but did brush off the rumor as  petty stuff . He also reaffirmed his commitment to Trump and to the country.

231,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-north-korea-threat_us_598a12afe4b0d793738ad5ee","WASHINGTON <U+2015> President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened North Korea, promising fire and fury like the world has never seen, following new reports the country has escalated its nuclear program . North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen, he said in a short statement to reporters at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, before a meeting on the opioid crisis. He has been very threatening, beyond a normal statement, Trump said of the countrys leader, Kim Jong Un. And as I said, they will be met with fire, fury and frankly, power, the likes of which this world has never seen before. Trumps ultimatum, which mirrors North Koreas rhetoric toward the United States , came as U.S. intelligence officials reportedly learned that North Korea has produced a miniaturized nuclear warhead that could be placed on a missile , a significant step in advancing its nuclear program. A few hours after Trumps news conference, North Koreas official KCNA news agency carried a series of statements from military spokesmen responding to the presidents rhetoric. Using bombastic language typical to KCNA statements, a spokesman claimed that Pyonyang was carefully examining plans to launch missiles at the U.S. island territory of Guam. In a separate post, another North Korean military spokesman warned that war is by no means a game and claimed that U.S. war-thirsty forces are engrossed in war hysteria without discretion. KCNA also published a post titled U.S. Reckless War Frenzy Slammed, in which the propaganda arm blamed Washington for making plans to carry out a pre-emptive strike against North Korea. In recent weeks, the country has also claimed that it successfully tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles, which may be capable of reaching Alaska. U.S. intelligence officials do not know whether North Korea has tested the miniaturized warhead yet, according to NBC News and The Washington Post . On Monday, North Korea issued a similarly strong threat to the U.S. Should the U.S. pounce upon the DPRK with military force at last, the DPRK is ready to teach the U.S. a severe lesson with its strategic nuclear force, foreign minister Ri Yong Ho said in a statement , referring to North Korea. Trump has regularly responded to North Koreas nuclear escalation with little specificity, insisting that all options are on the table. He has taken particular issue with China , North Koreas only ally, for not doing more to rein in the nuclear program and suggested economic consequences against the country, an important U.S. trade partner. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, criticized Trumps rhetoric in an interview with KTAR radio on Tuesday . I take exception to the presidents comments because youve got to be able to do what you say youre going to do, McCain said. In other words, the old walk softly but carry a big stick, Teddy Roosevelts saying, which I think is something that shouldve applied because all its going to do is bring us closer to a serious confrontation. McCain, however, said he was unsure of whether Trumps statement could be interpreted as a threat to North Korea. I dont know what hes saying and Ive long ago given up trying to interpret what he says. Its not terrible, but its kind of the classic Trump in that he overstates things. Later Tuesday , Guams congressional delegate Madeleine Bordallo responded to North Koreas provocation, saying she was  confident that Guam remains safe and protected . I am confident in the ability of U.S. defenses to protect our island and allies in the region, she said. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is meeting with officials in Asia this week, exploring diplomatic solutions to the growing crisis .

232,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kt-mcfarland-russia-thrown-election-email_us_5a232480e4b0a02abe9195b6","A senior official on President Donald Trump s transition team suggested that Russia had thrown the U.S. presidential election in Trumps favor in a December 2016 email thread leaked to the New York Times and published Saturday. The emails contradict White House lawyer Ty Cobbs claims that Michael Flynn, Trumps former national security adviser, acted independently when he reached out to Russian officials during Trumps transition to presidency. Hours after the Obama administration imposed sanctions against Russia for its meddling in the 2016 presidential election, Trumps former Deputy National Security Adviser KT McFarland suggested that the transition team would need to strengthen its relationship with Russia, according to email exchanges obtained by or described by unnamed sources to the Times. The sanctions, McFarland noted in the email , appeared to be the outgoing administrations attempt to discredit Trumps victory in the election and would make it more difficult for the incoming president to improve the U.S.s relationship with Russia. If there is a tit-for-tat escalation Trump will have difficulty improving relations with Russia, which has just thrown the U.S.A. election to him, McFarland wrote, according to the Times . As Times reporter Michael S. Schmidt noted in the story and later on Twitter, its not clear if McFarland believed that Russia threw the election in Trumps favor, but a White House lawyer told the paper on Friday that she was only saying Democrats were trying to make it appear that way . The leaked emails show how Trumps transition team worked to ease relations with Russia after former President Barack Obama attempted to punish the country for reportedly interfering in the U.S. election. These efforts would include Flynn reaching out to Russian ambassador Sergey I. Kislyak to discuss the sanctions hours after they were placed,McFarland wrote in an email, according to the Times. Flynn later resigned from his post in February following revelations that he lied about his conversations with the Russian ambassador . On Friday, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian government, including his conversation with Kislyak about the sanctions.After news of Flynns guilty plea spread, Trump tweeted that he had to fire Flynn because he knew Flynn lied to Vice President Michael Pence and the FBI. On the same day Flynn pleaded guilty, the Associated Press identified McFarland as the unnamed senior official in court papers who is said to have talked to Flynn about what he would say to Russian officials during a discussion on the Obama administrations sanctions. Trump has called for friendlier relations with Russia and continuously denies claims that his election campaign colluded with Russia during last years presidential election.

233,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/moore-dated-highschool-girls_us_5a07944ce4b05673aa59a22f","A former prosecutor who worked in Alabama with GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore in the early 1980s told CNN on Saturday that it was common knowledge that Moore dated teenagers  and people thought it was weird. It was common knowledge that Roy dated high school girls. Everyone we knew thought it was weird, former Etowah County deputy district attorney Teresa Jones told CNN national correspondent Alexander Marquardt. We wondered why someone his age would hang out at high school football games and the mall. But you really wouldnt say anything to someone like that. Marquardt reached out to Jones after a comment she posted in response to a story in the Gadsden Times . When asked on Twitter why girls didnt step forward at the time, Jones responded:At that time, in that atmosphere unless the girls came forward with specifics, then no, no charges could have been brought. The Weinstein, Hoffman, etc. revelations have made it far more palatable for women to come forward. Jones spoke out as Moore was vehemently denying an explosive Washington Post story about his alleged history of pursuing teenagers when he was in his 30s.Leigh Corfman told the Post that Moore, 32 at the time, removed her shirt and pants at his home in 1979 when she was just 14, touched her through her bra and guided her hand to his genitals over his underwear. Moore on Saturday promised there would be revelations about the accusations. I am not guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone, Moore said during a Veterans Day speech in Gadsden, and called the allegations hurtful. He insisted the Post story was politically motivated, aimed at damaging his chances in the Dec. 12 special election for the U.S. Senate seat in Alabama. To think that grown women would wait 40 years.... to bring charges is absolutely unbelievable, Moore said. There are investigations going on. In the next few days, there will be revelations about the motivations and the content of this article. When Fox News host Sean Hannity asked Moore on Friday on his radio program if he remembered dating teenagers when he was in his 30s, Moore responded:  Not generally, no.  Jones worked as deputy district attorney for Etowah County, Ala., from 1982 to 1985 . Moore worked in the same office as deputy district attorney from 1977 to 1982. He would have been approximately 35 to 38 years old during the time he worked with Jones. Jones is currently a partner at the Syprett, Meshad, Resnick, Lieb, Dumbaugh, Jones, Krotec & Westheimer, P.A. law firm based in Sarasota, Florida. The HuffPost has reached out to her for further comment. It remains to be seen how badly the Post story will hurt Moore. Several Republican politicians have criticized Moore, and three GOP senators Sens. Steve Daines (Mont.), Bill Cassidy (La.) and Mike Lee (Utah)  have rescinded their support. Donald Trump has said Moore should drop out of the race  if the allegations are true.",1,73.78,6.5,10.5,490,34,"Everyone Knew Roy Moore Dated High School Girls, Says Former Colleague",2017-11-11 23:10:00,"Mary Papenfuss","Politics","@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_trends,roy-moore,sex-crimes,type: news,us-news",309132,288826,309132,420610,57892,203072,1.064,1.102,1.375,1.681,116442,152611,40079,32664,192587,14442,13107,32194,30229,1763,8,23,11366,10947,282,43,94,"Everyone Knew Roy Moore Dated High School Girls, Says Former Colleague",2017-11-11 23:10:00,"Mary Papenfuss","Politics","@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_trends,roy-moore,sex-crimes,type: news,us-news",309132,288826,309132,420610,57892,203072,1.064,1.102,1.375,1.681,116442,152611,40079,32664,192587,14442,13107,32194,30229,1763,8,23,11366,10947,282,43,94

Trump, speaking in an impromptu interview with The New York Times from his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, said more than a dozen times that no collusion had been uncovered during the sweeping probe by special counsel Robert Mueller. While he noted that the sooner the inquiry was completed, the better it is for the country, Trump also broke with his most ardent supporters and said he believed Mueller would treat him fairly. I have absolute right to do what I want to do with the Justice Department, he told the Times. But for purposes of hopefully thinking Im going to be treated fairly, Ive stayed uninvolved with this particular matter. The presidents comments, made without any aides present, once again appear to undermine the DOJs ability to operate as an entity independent of the political whims of the White House. Trumps surrogates have moved in recent months to discredit Muellers investigation , and rumors have swirled for weeks that the president may fire the special counsel . The president <U+2015> who has denied he planned to remove Mueller <U+2015> has repeatedly called the probe a  witch hunt  and insisted on his innocence, saying there was no collusion with the Russian government by members of his presidential campaign. Theres been no collusion, Trump told the Times. But I think hes going to be fair. The White House has also rejected assertions by the countrys leading intelligence agencies that Russia did meddle in the election, and Trump in November said he believed Russian President Vladimir Putins denials of such interference. Every time he sees me, he says, I didnt do that, and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it, Trump said of Putin, according to the Times. I think he is very insulted by it, which is not a good thing for our country. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was forced to defend Muellers investigation earlier this month in the midst of criticisms, saying he believed the investigation was appropriately remaining in his scope and that the special counsel was conducting himself appropriately. In Thursdays interview, Trump expressed regret that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had recused himself from the Russia investigation, which led to the appointment of Mueller. Its too bad Jeff recused himself, he said. I like Jeff, but its too bad he recused himself.

235,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-manafort-trump-russia-mueller_us_59f4b672e4b077d8dfc9f356","WASHINGTON <U+2015> Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and onetime business associate Rick Gates were indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of conspiracy and money laundering in connection with an intensifying investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Manafort left his Virginia condo and, with his attorney, walked into the FBI field office in Washington early Monday. A 12-count federal grand jury indictment unsealed shortly after his surrender includes charges of conspiracy against the U.S., conspiracy to launder money, failure to file foreign bank reports and false statements. Manafort and Gates both pleaded not guilty to the charges in federal court. Separately, a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser has pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about Russian dirt he was offered on Hillary Clinton, according to a plea deal prosecutors unsealed Monday.George Papadopoulos, 30,pleaded guilty on Oct. 5 and has been cooperating in the Russia probe. The charges are the first in the probe led by the office of special counsel Robert Mueller , a former FBI director.Mondays arrests come three days after news broke that a federal grand jury in Washington had filed charges stemming from Muellers investigation. Manafort and Gates generated tens of millions of dollars in income as a result of their Ukraine work, the indictment says. In order to hide Ukraine payments from United States authorities, from approximately 2006 through at least 2016, Manafort and Gates laundered the money through scores of United States and foreign corporations, partnerships, and bank accounts. Failing to pay taxes allowed Manafort a lavish lifestyle in the United States, according to the indictment, which alleges he spent millions of dollars on luxury goods and services for himself and his extended family through payments wired from offshore nominee accounts to United States vendors. Manafort laundered more than $18 million, which he used to buy property, goods and services in the U.S., the indictment alleges. Hes accused of spending $849,215 at one clothing store, $520,440 at another clothing store, about $934,000 at an antique rug store, $62,750 for a Mercedes Benz, and $47,000 for a Range Rover. Reports have suggested federal investigators could use criminal charges as way to pressure those arrested into providing more information about alleged collusion between President Donald Trumps campaign and the Kremlin to influence the election. The indictment charging Manafort and Gates makes no mention of Trump or the election. Trump has aggressively denied allegations that his team colluded with Russia to win the election. A former prosecutor and FBI director,Mueller partnered with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman in August to look into Manaforts possible financial crimes, including money laundering . Manafort ran Trumps presidential campaign from June 2016 until his resignation in August of that year,after reports surfaced about his past lobbying work for pro-Russian Ukrainian oligarchs. He retroactively registered as a foreign agent and disclosed more than $17 million in payments for his firms consulting work in Ukraine, which occurred before he joined Trumps campaign. You can get rid of Manafort, said Robby Mook, who was the campaign manager for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, but that doesnt end the odd bromance Trump has with [the Russian President]. Manafort met with Senate Intelligence Committee investigators in July to discuss a meeting between Trump associates and a Russian lawyer that was held during the election campaign to obtain dirt on Clinton. The next day, FBI agents seized documents and other items from Manaforts house in Virginia without warning. Investigators have also issued subpoenas seeking testimony from a number of people linked to Manafort throughout the probe. Trump described the pre-dawn raid of Manaforts home as pretty tough stuff. Ive always found Paul Manafort to be a very decent man, the president said at the time. Hes like a lot of other people, probably makes consultant fees from all over the place, who knows, I dont know, but I thought it was pretty tough stuff to wake him up, perhaps his family was there. Trump fired FBI director James Comey, who was leading the agencys investigation into Russian interference in the election, in May.The following week, the Justice Department appointed Mueller as special counsel to oversee the federal inquiry into the Trump campaigns alleged Russian ties. Led by some very bad and conflicted people, Trump tweeted in June,the Russia probe is the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) in a tweet that implied she was willing to trade sex for campaign contributions. Trump, in an early-morning tweet the day after four of his accusers called on Congress to investigate him, first blamed Democrats for the false accusationsinvolving women who I dont know and/or have never met. In a second tweet, Trump attacked Gillibrand as lightweight and a total flunky for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). He claimed she begged him for campaign donations in the past and would do anything for them. Gillibrand responded to Trumps tweet by calling it a sexist smear. She also pointing out that millions of women protested Trumps inauguration and have been stirred into activism since his election. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) accused the president of attempting toslut-shame Gillibrand. Disgusting, it was disgusting, she told reporters of Trumps tweet . Its clear what he was getting at. More than a dozen women have accused Trump of sexual harassment or assault. Among them are a former business partner, contestants on his reality television show The Apprentice, and a People magazine reporter who interviewed him and his wife, Melania, in 2005. Some of Trumps accusers have revived their stories amid the wave of misconduct claims against prominent men in politics, media and entertainment, as well as Trumps support for Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore , who faces allegations that he sexually assaulted and preyed on teenage girls when he was in his 30s. Four of Trumps accusers this week asked Congress to hold him accountable for his actions. Several Democratic senators, including Gillibrand, Cory Booker (N.J.) and Jeff Merkley (Ore.), have called on Trump to quit . On Monday night, a group of more than 50 female House Democrats wrote a letter to the House Oversight Committee to demand a congressional probe, CNN reported. The president and the White House have repeatedly claimed that all of the women who have come forward against Trump are liars , and that Trumps electoral victory last year should have put the issue to rest. The people of this country,in a decisive election, supported President Trump, and we feel like these allegations have been answered through that process, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters on Monday. Trump reportedly is also trying to cast doubt on the authenticity of the infamous 2005 Access Hollywood recording of him bragging about sexual assault. On Tuesday, Sanders defended Trumps tweets, saying it was very obvious that he was referring tothe corruption of the entire political system. Hes not alleging anything, Sanders said at Tuesdays White House press briefing. Theres no way that this is sexist at all. Sanders again referred to the sexual misconduct allegations as false and fabricated, saying that questions about them had been asked and answered during last years election.

238,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-method-madness_us_59e125d7e4b03a7be580b923","WASHINGTON <U+2015> The conventional wisdom about President Donald Trump is clear enough: Hes an infantile, ignorant moron surrounded by a shrinking political base, a phalanx of enemies who used to be friends, and more investigators than the FBI Academy. Washington reacts with alarm to his inflammatory tweets, and lately has made a parlor game out of chronicling his outbursts of anger, dismay and ignorance, as news organizations offer a cascade of vivid in-the-room portrayals of an out-of-control boy king. Democrats hope against hope that he will be impeached over Russia. His approval rating is lower at this point in his term than any previous modern presidents. His former consigliere Steve Bannon has reportedly said Trump has only a 30 percent chance of lasting a full term. But by the end of this week, it was clearer than ever that if Trump is a moron, he is a moron on a mission <U+2015> and with more method to his madness than his enemies understand or want to consider. The tweets are a useful distraction <U+2015> a kind of air cover for his carpet bombing of federal policy and programs. In quick succession, the president and his small but focused dead-end gang have used administrative diktats to wreak havoc on clean air rules, immigration procedures, Obamacare and the Iran deal. Each of these moves <U+2015> whether designed to serve the interests of big business, Tea Party xenophobes or the new Sunni-neocon alliance <U+2015> is unpopular . Trump doesnt seem to mind. He knows what he wants. Outraged critics immediately turned to Congress and the courts for help, but it isnt clear whether they will get it. Republican majorities in Congress are fairly thin, but theyre probably big enough to prevent legislative reversals of these and other Trump moves. On Iran, for example, Trumps newest GOP enemy, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), is working on a measure that includes some features of the presidents new, harsher approach, and Corker was opposed to the Iran deal when it was approved initially. The presidents foes are going to court <U+2015> or have already gone to court <U+2015> over his attacks on Obama-era immigration, clean air and Affordable Care Act measures. But the critics face two potential problems. First, many of the Obama-era rules are based on administrative actions, and are not armored by having been enacted by Congress and signed into law. That makes Trumps own use of the bureaucracy, and his contempt for proper administrative procedure,somewhat easier to defend for anyone inclined to do so. Second, Trump is fast filling vacancies in federal courts that will review these and other actions. He is doing so at a speedier clip than his predecessors. Names are fed to the White House in assembly-line fashion by Leonard Leo, the leader of the conservative Federalist Society and one of the least-known most powerful people in D.C. The Senate is only in GOP hands by a margin of 52 of 48. But its rare for a Republican to waste a confrontation with Trump over a judicial nominee. And Democrats efforts to delay or kill the presidents picks are at risk of being undercut further by the Republican leadership. After having been repeatedly humiliated in public and private by Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) now says he personally favors getting rid of a custom that allows any senator, even one in the minority, to scotch a nominee from his or her own state. By the time challenges to ACA, the Environmental Protection Agency and other rules reach trial, the complexion of the court may well have changed in Trumps favor. Do Trumps moves jeopardize the GOPs control of the House or Senate (or both)? Maybe <U+2015> especially when it comes to health care, where premiums may rise and Democrats can blame it on Republicans and the president. But does he care? Not clear. Hes already at war with his own party, and his renegade buddy Bannon is preparing the ground for the next stage of the nihilistic anti-everything revolution. If the Democrats take control of Congress, there will at least be some partisan consistency in Trumps attacks on it. Just because Trump tweets furiously and seems easily distracted doesnt mean that he and the die-hards around him <U+2015> like Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, speechwriter/foreign policy agitator Stephen Miller and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt <U+2015> arent playing a long game.

239,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-mcconnell-criticism_us_598b54c8e4b0a66b8bb0aa01","President Donald Trump on Thursday lashed out at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) over Republicans latest failed attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. He also implored the Kentucky lawmaker to get back to work and pass legislation on tax reform and infrastructure spending. Trumps comments echoed similar ones hed made the day before, rebuking McConnells claim that the president had been overly optimistic about health care reform. Senator Mitch McConnell said I had excessive expectations, but I dont think so, Trump tweeted on Wednesday. After 7 years of hearing Repeal & Replace, why not done? McConnell had accused Trump of having excessive expectations for legislative progress during remarks to a Rotary Club in Kentucky on Monday. Part of the reason I think that the storyline is that [lawmakers] havent done much is because, in part, the president and others have set these early timelines about things need to be done by a certain point, he said. McConnell hinted that Trumps insistence on haste had made Congress failure to repeal the ACA, also known as Obamacare, look more damning than it actually was. Our new president, of course, has not been in this line of work before, McConnell said Monday. And I think he had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process. Taking McConnell to the woodshed on social media apparently wasnt Trumps first move. Prior to the tweets posting, Trump phoned McConnell to complain about the senators remarks, The New York Times reported. Trump also reportedly vowed to continue calling for a repeal of Obamacare and urged McConnell to do so as well. Trump had certainly projected optimism about the prospects of repeal well before there was any real chance of it. In February, he claimed repeal was on track to succeed by the middle of March . It went on to fail in the House in March, before passing in a revised form in May. The president rarely lets criticism go unanswered. Trumps social media director Dan Scavino lambasted McConnell on Twitter earlier on Wednesday for offering more excuses. Trump has issued stinging indictments of trusted allies in the past, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions , his first supporter in the Senate. But this is his first public spat with McConnell, the steely tactician responsible for shepherding the remainder of Trumps legislative agenda through the notoriously tricky Senate. In a nod to McConnell on Tuesday, Trump endorsed McConnells preferred candidate in the Republican Alabama Senate primary:Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.), who has been occupying the seat vacated by Sessions earlier this year. It is unclear how a chill in relations between Trump and McConnell might affect the GOP agenda. Trump is pushing a bill introduced by Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and David Perdue (R-Ga.) that would dramatically reduce legal immigration . He also has ambitious plans to overhaul the tax code and pass a budget with deep spending cuts. McConnell indeed presided over the narrow defeat of the so-called skinny Obamacare repeal bill at the end of July. McConnell appeared to be as blindsided and disappointed in the result <U+2015> made possible by Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and John McCain (Ariz.) breaking with their fellow Republicans <U+2015> as Trump was. The bills collapse signaled the end of efforts to repeal Obamacare for the foreseeable future.",0,55.44,9.5,11.3,552,35,"Trump Pushes Back Against Mitch McConnell's Criticism Of 'Excessive Expectations'",2017-08-09 14:37:00,"Daniel Marans","Politics","@genassign,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_ga,donald-trump,mitch-mcconnell,obamacare,senate,type: news,us-news",305505,250303,305505,344460,34630,209030,1.068,1.22,1.17,1.421,159886,115281,30338,6245,256126,2575,11888,4911,4124,755,NA,2,2603,2516,66,8,13,"Trump Pushes Back Against Mitch McConnell's Criticism Of 'Excessive Expectations'",2017-08-09 14:37:00,"Daniel Marans","Politics","@genassign,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_ga,donald-trump,mitch-mcconnell,obamacare,senate,type: news,us-news",305505,250303,305505,344460,34630,209030,1.068,1.22,1.17,1.421,159886,115281,30338,6245,256126,2575,11888,4911,4124,755,NA,2,2603,2516,66,8,13
240,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-strategy-charlottesville_us_5994b068e4b06ef724d61291","WASHINGTON  Lets be clear about what President Donald Trump was up to Tuesday during his press conference in Trump Tower , and what his longer-range plan is for surviving, if not prospering, in the White House for at least four years. Speaking publicly in the family fortress in the wake of the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, he wasnt trying to convince anyone of the facts. There could be no dispute about them if you saw, say, the Vice video of hideous neo-Nazis, KKK members, generic white supremacists and rancid anti-Semites in the streets carrying torches and chanting Jews will not replace us. No, the president was doing something else: trolling the media, deliberately goading reporters he knew were waiting for him in his echoing marble lobby. He basked in their urgent outrage and determined focus on Charlottesville. He had scripted himself as the alt-rights Daniel in a fake news lions den of his own devising. Was he upset by the resulting headline and denunciations from the likes of the former presidents Bush, father and son ? Hardly. He had sought them. In fact, word on Wednesday was that Trump had been in a good, almost celebratory, mood Tuesday after the confrontation hed created. He had unleashed himself, perhaps once and for all. He was in the fight, and the fight is all. More broadly and big-picture, look for more of the same. Having risen to power by dividing the country, his party leadership and even, at times, his own campaign team, his aim now is to divide or discredit any institution, tradition or group in his way. Donald Trump seems perfectly willing to destroy the country to maintain his own power. He is racing to undermine the federal political system  if not all American public life  before still-independent forces (for now, the federal courts, the press and Congress) undermine him .  The goal, as always with Trump, is to win amid the chaos he sows, to be the last man standing in rubble. And winning is rapidly being reduced to the raw, basic terms he prefers: brute survival. With a record-setting low approval rating, world crises everywhere and a special counsel on his tail, the main victory he can hope for is staying in office. Its not only an emotional imperative for Trump, its a deliberate <U+2015> and thus far successful <U+2015> strategy. I am told by lawyers familiar with special counsel Robert Muellers methods and those of similar investigations that Mueller almost certainly obtained the presidents federal tax returns long ago. Whether Trump knows that directly or not, he has to assume it  and be driven wild by it. The counsel also has assembled an industrial-strength team of experts in international money-laundering, criminal tax fraud and forensic accounting. So the survival urge is more urgent. How does he do it? Here is some of whats ahead: More white-right protests Trump doesnt plan them (unless you consider his own rallies), but he also may not mind seeing more of them take place. He certainly hasnt called for any group to cease and desist. San Francisco is next , with the Patriot Prayer group leading the way. Those who worry about the coming SF event note that it is scheduled for a park controlled by the National Park Service. Focus on anti-Trump protesters Trump avoided Vietnam with a medical deferment, which is perhaps why he now sees glamour in being The Leader Under Siege. Federal prosecutors have obliged this storyline by issuing sweeping subpoenas for the internet records of possible demonstrators at his inauguration. Focus on voter fraud This isnt a substantial problem, but it is a substantial opportunity for Trump not only to try to limit Democrat-leaning votes but also to force Democrats to spend extra time and messaging on the cause of minority rights. When he says they about the Democrats, he wants his own base to see what he means. Goad the press In his first tweet on Wednesday , Trump took aim at Amazon , which is owned by Jeff Bezos, also the owner of The Washington Post. The president accused the site of doing great damage to main-street retailers. But regulatory or tax threats aside, Trump will continue to troll the news pages and airwaves of the Post and other major outlets, knowing that the more righteous indignation they show, the less his hard-core base will believe them. Muscle witnesses Paul Manafort, Trumps former campaign chairman, denied in a filing that he was cooperating with Hill investigators who are looking into whether the campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election. The message was meant for Trump. Manafort, who had extensive dealings with Vladimir Putin allies in Ukraine, didnt want his vindictive (former) boss to think that hed flipped to the other side. But the presidents allies sent a message back just in case. The National Enquirer, with close ties to Trump, recently published a long piece claiming that Manafort had had a sick affair with a younger woman and had somehow been betraying his country. Stack the courts This is far from the headlines, but its critical, and it influences the places in which the Trump administrations attempts to dismantle the regulatory state, civil rights laws and voting rights will literally be judged. It is also where Mueller will ask for any prosecutions of those in the Trump circle. And unlike most of the rest of the Trump administration, where disorganization and understaffing are the rule, the judge-picking process has largely been left to the Federalist Society, which is efficient in the extreme. As of now, Democrat-nominated judges still predominate, but in another year or two Trump could well have created a firewall for himself in most circuits. Drain Obamacare Even many Republicans want to infuse emergency cash into strapped health care markets; that is, to shore up Obamacare unless and until it is killed off. But Trump will favor benign neglect at the most, and not just because he wants Obamacare to fail. The programs problems offer the added political benefit of dividing the Democrats on a key issue. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and company are now making support for a single-payer, Medicare-for-all system a litmus test for candidates . But it is a test that other liberal Democrats warn is divisive and unrealistic. Music to Trumps ears. Thirty-four Trump must keep the allegiance of this many Republican senators to defeat any attempt to convict him in an impeachment trial in the Senate, if there ever is one. You can be sure he knows this number, and that much of his strategy is made with it in mind. Hed rather have a small number of hard-core locked and loaded supporters than a larger number of unreliable moderates; its the impeachment version of his 2016 Electoral College strategy. Trump evidently regards Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell , the GOP Senate leader, as too weak to be reliable. But the president had better think twice about trying to have him replaced.

241,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jared-kushner-security-clearance_us_596783aae4b0a0c6f1e67433","WASHINGTON <U+2015> House Republicans voted Thursday to block an effort aimed at revoking the security clearance of White House senior adviser Jared Kushner . Several members of Congress have questioned the appropriateness of Kushner maintaining a security clearance following bombshell reports that he met with a Kremlin-linked lawyer who promised incriminating information about 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton during last years campaign. The presidents son-in-law failed to disclose the meeting, as well as several other meetings with Russian officials, on the security clearance form he submitted before the Trump administration took office. Knowingly omitting such information is a crime. Kushners lawyers, however, maintain the omissions were an error and have amended the form. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), who chaired the Democratic National Committee during much of last years campaign cycle, proposed an amendment targeting Kushner during a House Appropriations Committee markup session Thursday. It was voted down, 22-30, along party lines. The measure would have barred the government from issuing or maintaining a security clearance for any White House individual under a criminal investigation by a Federal law enforcement agency for aiding a foreign government. Wasserman Schultz also attempted to introduce an amendment that would bar the government from issuing or maintaining a security clearance for White House staff who deliberately fail to disclose meetings with foreign nationals. It was voted down by the same margin. In addition to the revelations from the past week, The New York Times reported in May that federal and congressional investigators are looking into a December meeting between Kushner and a Russian banker with ties to Russian intelligence. McClatchy also reported this week that investigators in Congress and the Justice Department are looking into whether the Trump campaigns digital team, which was led by Kushner,directed Russian operatives to key U.S. states. This amendment is an important step in protecting the American people from the threat of hostile foreign interference. That is not a controversial or a political goal, Wasserman Schultz said during the hearing. Revoking Jared Kushners security clearance would send a clear signal to anyone who would consider aiding and abetting a foreign enemy state to affect the outcome of a U.S. presidential election that they will not be entrusted with our nations most sensitive information, she added. Republicans called the move a stunt, arguing that it is unnecessary and unproductive under current federal regulations. This is already the law, Rep. John Culberson (R-Texas) said. The use of funding prohibitions to deny or remove security clearances is simply a political stunt and utterly unnecessary because security clearances can already be revoked because of criminal conduct. Reports of Kushners failure to disclose meetings with Russian officials also drew the ire of Democrats in the Senate this week. There is a crisis of trust that the White House has to deal with, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said Wednesday, adding that Kushner ought to resign .",0,35.07,13.1,14.6,480,25,"Republicans Block Effort To Revoke Jared Kushner's Security Clearance",2017-07-13 13:04:00,"Igor Bobic","Politics","@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_national_beats,congress,election-campaigns,executive-office-of-the-president-of-the-united-states,foreign-intelligence-service,jared-kushner,political-science,type: news,united-states-house-committee-on-appropriations,us-congressional-elections,us-news,us-presidential-elections,white-house",304354,284771,304354,253821,47674,163259,1.033,1.089,1.095,1.191,108744,163535,32075,16023,128631,25092,21661,94302,64292,26815,2,42,105863,100367,5352,32,112,"Republicans Block Effort To Revoke Jared Kushner's Security Clearance",2017-07-13 13:04:00,"Igor Bobic","Politics","@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_national_beats,congress,election-campaigns,executive-office-of-the-president-of-the-united-states,foreign-intelligence-service,jared-kushner,political-science,type: news,united-states-house-committee-on-appropriations,us-congressional-elections,us-news,us-presidential-elections,white-house",304354,284771,304354,253821,47674,163259,1.033,1.089,1.095,1.191,108744,163535,32075,16023,128631,25092,21661,94302,64292,26815,2,42,105863,100367,5352,32,112

Court filings and multiple reports hint at an elaborate, multinational effort led by Flynn and Kushner to undermine then-President Barack Obama at the behest of then-President-elect Trump. In December 2016,the United Nations Security Council was nearing a vote on a resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Jerusalem.The Obama administration, then in its last full month in office, had decided not to veto the resolution, a landmark shift in U.S. policy toward Israel. Trump, weeks away from assuming the presidency, publicly urged Obama to veto the resolution. It now appears that, behind the scenes, members of Trumps transition team may have pressured other countries to delay the vote until Trump took office. Such coordination could be a violation of the Logan Act, a federal law passed in 1799 that forbids unauthorized citizens from negotiating with foreign governments. Flynn said a very senior member of the Presidential Transition Team directed him to call officials from foreign governments in an attempt to block the vote, according to court records. Sources told several news outlets that Kushner is that senior official . Jared called Flynn and told him, you need to get on the phone to every member of the Security Council and tell them to delay the vote,a Trump transition official who was in the room with Flynn at the time of the call told BuzzFeed ,adding that Kushner described the issue as a top priority for the president. Mueller reportedly questioned Kushner about Flynn behind closed doors in November. Kushners alleged direction to interfere with the vote is a major development as Muellers investigators close in on members of the presidents inner circle. The New York Times also reported Friday that Muellers investigators have learned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked Trumps transition team to lobby other nations to back Israel , citing two people briefed on the inquiry.

I dont mind getting a little hand, so call that congressman and call that senator and make sure you get it, he told the crowd, before plugging another item on his agenda. And by the way, you can also call those senators to make sure you get health care. Trump also blamed numerous military setbacks on the budget caps on government defense spending, put in place by the 2011 sequester agreement. The remarks above begin at 5:30 in the video below. His political requests to the crowd were strange for a naval commissioning ceremony. As the Washington Post pointed out , Trumps request for help in pushing his agenda could have been perceived by the military members in attendance, whom he commands, as an order. Trumps speech followed his early morning Twitter rant in which he claimed that U.S. presidents have the  complete power to pardon , in response to the Posts report speculating that Trump is considering pardons for his aides, family and potentially himself amid investigations into alleged ties between his campaign and Russia. His series of tweets, which covered a number of topics, also included a call on Republican senators to vote to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, declaring it dead .

The outburst began late Friday after Holder tweeted: Speaking on behalf of the vast majority of the American people, Republicans in Congress be forewarned: any attempt to remove Bob Mueller will not be tolerated. These are BS attacks on him/his staff that are blatantly political-designed to hide the real wrongdoing. Country not party. Holder was apparently referring to the GOPs mounting calls to oust Mueller amid complaints that the former FBI directors investigation has been biased against the Trump administration. Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) has said that the latest rumors indicate that President Donald Trump was preparing to fire Mueller  possibly before Christmas  as the probe into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia inches closer to the presidents associates. Cornyn shot back that Holder does not speak for the majority of Americans. When Washington Post reporter Greg Sargeant asked Cornyn on Twitter if he would accept Muellers findings as legitimate, Cornyn responded: Makes sense to see what they are first. In a May statement, after Mueller was appointed special counsel,Cornyn said that Mueller is perhaps the single most qualified individual to lead such an investigation, in my view, and hes certainly independent. Trump and Republican legislators have begun to harp on what they charge is Muellers bias as the investigation intensifies. During a House Judiciary Committee hearing this week, they indicated that Muellers investigation is compromised. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said theres no reason dismiss Mueller.

249,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-party-congress-senate-alabama_us_5a2d3a0ee4b0a290f0517742","Narrow wins in special elections dont typically qualify as major political events, but Tuesday nights Senate race in Alabama , in which Democrat Doug Jones is the apparent winner, may be the exception. The last time Alabama sent a Democrat to the Senate was 1992, when it elected Richard Shelby, who later switched parties to become a Republican. Jones isnt switching parties. He looks like a bona fide Democrat, if a relatively moderate one by national standards. That alone makes the election result newsworthy, especially since strong turnout by African-American voters <U+2015> in a state famously hostile to those voters <U+2015> arguably made Jones the winner. But Tuesdays result will have a profound, near-immediate effect on how Washington operates for the very simple reason that a shift in this one seat dramatically alters the makeup of the Senate <U+2015> making it more difficult for the GOP to pass the kind of radical agenda its leaders have in mind. More broadly, it sends a message that the usual rules of politics still apply: that the more Republicans defy public opinion, the more likely they are to suffer electoral consequences. For the last year, Republican strategy on major legislation, like their tax cut and repeal of the Affordable Care Act , has been to pass bills through using budget reconciliation rules. Thats the special, expedited process in which senators cant filibuster, so a simple majority will suffice. Right now, Republicans have 52 seats, which means they can afford to lose only two seats on such proposals. (In case of a 50-50 tie, Vice President Mike Pence can break the tie in Republicans favor.) When Jones takes his seat, that GOP majority shrinks to 51, which means Republicans will be able to lose just one GOP vote if all Democrats vote against them. The GOPs margin for error just shrunk by half. Thats a pretty big deal. As it was, GOP leaders in the Senate couldnt hold enough seats to pass Obamacare repeal. The closest they came was on repeal legislation in July , when they lost three of their own <U+2015> Susan Collins of Maine, John McCain of Arizona and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Some Republicans are hoping to revisit repeal next year, figuring they could flip one of those three to yes. Now, with Jones and the diminished GOP majority, theyd have to flip at least two of them. Thats a lot more difficult, especially since none of those three have shown any sign of wavering on their core commitment to preserve the programs Medicaid expansion and protections for people with pre-existing conditions. As for the major legislation under discussion right now, the GOP tax cut, its prospects look better. Although its not totally out of the question that the effort could stall , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said the party will vote on the proposal before Jones takes his seat. Even Collins is voting yes, although shes counting on Republicans also passing a series of side measures to keep the health care system stable <U+2015> and its not clear House Republicans are willing to do that. But whatever happens for the tax cut, the prospects for passing similarly sweeping legislation afterward, once Jones is in the Senate, are slim <U+2015> at least unless Republicans decide to abandon their strategy of passing legislation with party-line votes and try actual bipartisanship. Of course, even with a suddenly diminished Senate majority, Republicans will still be able to enact an agenda, mostly because of President Donald Trump s ability to shape policy through appointments and regulations. As HuffPosts S.V. Date notes, theres zero reason to think Tuesdays result will change Trumps behavior, because nothing changes his behavior. He is happy to defy political gravity and take his chances. But together with the results of Novembers Virginia gubernatorial election, in which another Trump-backed Republican suffered an even more crushing defeat, Tuesdays results are proof that political gravity still exists <U+2015> that despite all the built-in advantages Republicans have, from thinly veiled suppression of African-American votes across the South to a conservative echo chamber that perpetuates the most unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, the voters still get their say. The Alabama race had a lot to do with the idiosyncrasies of the campaign and the Republican candidate, Judge Roy Moore . But it also had to do with the GOP brand, which is hugely unpopular, and the way Trump is governing.One of the most remarkable results Tuesday was exit polling that showed Alabama voters split down the middle, 48 percent to 48 percent, on whether they approved of Trumps performance in office. Thats quite a statement from voters in a state that voted overwhelmingly for Trump just a little more than a year ago. If that sentiment persists, it could mean major Democratic gains in the 2018 November midterms. Forecasters already thought control of the House was in play but were more dubious about Democratic prospects in the Senate, largely because only two Republican seats <U+2015> one in Arizona and one in Nevada <U+2015> seemed vulnerable. But now that Alabamas seat has flipped, Democrats could seize control by winning those two vulnerable seats while holding on to the ones they are defending. In the meantime, assuming the Tuesday results hold up, Republicans are going to find legislating even harder than they have so far <U+2015> and its not like theyve gotten much done already.

We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence, Trump said in an impromptu statement on Monday after returning to the White House from his golf club in New Jersey. Racism is evil, and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, Neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans, he added. Trump had come under widespread criticism for not immediately denouncing the far-right groups , instead blaming many sides for Saturdays mayhem . On Sunday, White House officials clarified that Trump was referring towhite supremacists, KKK, Neo-Nazi and all extremist groups, in his previous remark, but the statement notably did not come from the president himself and was attributed to an unnamed spokesperson. Other members of the Trump administration, including Vice President Mike Pence, attempted to clarify Trumps Saturday statement by claiming that he meant to condemn extremist groups. But until his latest comments, Trump had remained silent about white supremacists, even as he tweeted Monday morning about a range of topics other than the weekends events. One tweet took aim at a CEO who stepped down from a White House manufacturing panel , protesting Trumps initial response to the Charlottesville violence. Trump in his Monday remarks said the Justice Department had opened a civil rights investigation into the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, the Charlottesville resident killed Saturday when a car allegedly driven by a white supremacist plowed into a crowd of counter-protesters. The president also said her death fills us with grief. Heyers mother , Susan Bro, thanked Trump in a statement for those words of comfort and for denouncing those who promote violence and hatred. Bro also expressed her condolences to the grieving families of the two state troopers and wished for the quick recovery for those injured in the weekends mayhem. She referred to two Virginia state policemen who were part of efforts to quell Saturdays violence and were killed when their helicopter crashed on Charlottesvilles outskirts. According to CNNs Jeff Zeleny, a White House aide said Trump insisted on making positive remarks about the economy at the beginning of his Monday statement.

251,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-health-bill-insurers-unworkable_us_59697eb7e4b0d6341fe9111c","Two organizations representing the U.S. health insurance industry just called a new provision of the Senate Republicans health care proposal simply unworkable in any form and warned that it would cause major hardship, especially for middle-class people with serious medical problems. The organizations, Americas Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, speak for the businesses that would be responsible for making the new system work <U+2015> or at least attempting to do so. That may help explain why, with a vote on the bill planned for next week, they are letting loose with what, by Washington lobbying standards, sounds like a primal scream. In a publicly posted letter to Senate leaders , the two groups focused their attention on an amendment that would undermine the Affordable Care Act s protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The amendment, crafted by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), would allow insurers to resume sales of policies that leave out key benefits, such as prescription drugs or mental health. More important, it would allow insurers to discriminate among customers based on medical status, charging higher premiums or denying policies altogether to people with existing medical problems <U+2015> from the severe, like cancer, to the relatively mild, like allergies. The Affordable Care Act prohibited those practices, forcing insurers to sell policies with comprehensive benefits and at uniform prices to everybody, no matter their medical status. This made coverage available to people who couldnt get it before, but it also forced insurers to raise underlying insurance premiums, because it meant they had to cover medical bills they had previously been able to dodge. The Affordable Care Act also has tax credits that offset these higher premiums, but they are based on income, and not everybody qualifies <U+2015> leaving many people, particularly in the middle- and upper-middle-class, paying a lot more for coverage. R epublicans have seized on these high premiums as one of the big flaws in Obamacare, promising that, if given the chance to repeal the law, they would eliminate the costly mandates driving them. But, tellingly, Republicans almost never speak explicitly about getting rid of pre-existing condition protections. Over the years, even as they were coming up with plans to weaken or eliminate the new insurance rules, they would promise publicly to keep those protections for pre-existing conditions in place. As recently as Friday, during an address to the nations governors, Vice President Mike Pence said the legislation ensures that every American with preexisting conditions has access to the coverage and care they need <U+2015> no exceptions. Cruz has attempted to maintain the same illusion, describing his amendment as the best of both worlds because it would still require insurers to offer some policies that conform to the existing rules <U+2015> that is, with all of the Affordable Care Acts essential benefits and available to all people at uniform prices. On Friday, the insurer groups explained why that couldnt work: A s healthy people move to the less-regulated plans, those with significant medical needs will have no choice but to stay in the comprehensive plans, and premiums will skyrocket for people with preexisting conditions. Subsidies would still shield some from the increases,but they would generally be smaller than the subsides under the Affordable Care Act and would be available to fewer people. For people who didnt qualify for assistance<U+2015> because their incomes exceeded 350 percent of the poverty line, or $86,100 for a family of four in 2017 <U+2015> the prices would become unaffordable, the insurer groups explained. Cruz and his allies have said the amendment contains provisions designed to make it viable <U+2015> including a $70 billion stability fund to help insurers keep premiums in the regulated plans from getting too high. In the letter, the insurers said, We also firmly believe dedicated funding included in the bill to address the cost of plans that cover people with pre-existing medical conditions is insufficient and additional funding will not make the provision workable for consumers or taxpayers. The insurers noted that a key element in any market-based coverage system is risk adjustment <U+2015> basically, an arrangement in which insurers that end up with more healthy beneficiaries relinquish some of their income, while those with less healthy beneficiaries get an injection of funds. But risk adjustment can only work when there are uniform benefit requirements across the market, the insurers warned <U+2015> and, under the Cruz proposal, benefits would vary wildly in the unregulated part of the market. Millions of more individuals will become uninsured, the insurer organizations said, concluding that we strongly oppose this provision. The substance of the warnings was not new. Ever since Cruz began discussing his proposal, and especially since it became apparent that Senate GOP leaders intended to add it to their bill, a chorus of independent experts, industry officials and trade groups has criticized it and warned of its potential effects. Among those weighing in recently were the American Academy of Actuaries , who released a report Friday that even included illustrations to explain how insurance is supposed to work <U+2015> and what would happen if healthy and sick people gravitated to different sets of plans. That report did not mention the Cruz proposal by name, but it made the same points <U+2015> stating, among other things, that, in a market with separate risk pools for compliant and noncompliant coverage, costs would no longer be spread over the broad enrollee population. But Friday nights blast from the insurer groups is noteworthy because AHIP, in particular,has a relatively conservative outlook and tends to have close relationships with Republicans. Among health care groups weighing in on repeal proposals over the last few months, insurers have been among the more reserved <U+2015> generally offering a nuanced mix of support and criticism.

In an afternoon press conference, Trump said that over the weekend, he wrote letters to the families of the four service members, who died in the deadliest U.S. combat operation of Trumps term thus far.The letters, Trump said,either have been sent already or will be sent Monday night. He also said he intends to call the families. Trump then took a moment to compare himself favorably to former presidents, saying he likes to call families when Im able to do it. The traditional way, if you look at President Obama and other presidents <U+2015> most of them didnt make calls.A lot of them didnt make calls.I like to call when its appropriate, when I think Im able to do it, Trump said. They have made the ultimate sacrifice, so generally I would say that I like to call. Im going to be calling them. I want a little time to pass. Other presidents have also gone beyond writing letters. Ari Fleischer, who served as spokesman for President George W. Bush <U+2015> who launched the United States into the Iraq and Afghanistan wars <U+2015> said Bush frequently went out of his way to interact with the military community. I know he wrote to the families and I often was with him when he met with families at military bases to commiserate in person, Fleischer said. Toward the end of Bushs presidency, The Washington Times reported that Bush  met privately with more than 500 families of troops killed in action and with more than 950 wounded veterans,often during private sessions. President Barack Obama , meanwhile,made a late-night visit to an Air Force base in Dover, Delaware, in 2009 to receive the bodies of several soldiers who were killed in action . President Trumps claim is wrong, an Obama spokesman told HuffPost Monday. President Obama engaged families of the fallen and wounded warriors throughout his presidency through calls, letters, visits to Section 60 at Arlington, visits to Walter Reed, visits to Dover, and regular meetings with Gold Star Families at the White House and across the country. Other former aides to Obama called out Trump for his comments Monday. Later in the press conference, a reporter pressed Trump on his claim about Obama. Trump backtracked a bit, saying: I dont know if he did. I was told that he didnt often. And a lot of presidents dont. President Obama, I think, probably did sometimes. Maybe sometimes he didnt. I dont know. Thats what I was told. All I can do is ask my generals, he added. Other presidents did not call. Theyd write letters. Some presidents didnt do anything. But I like the combination.When I can, I like the combination of a call and also a letter. Trump didnt then specify which presidents supposedly never called service members families. Before he was president, Trump circulated conspiracy theories about Obama supposedly failing to personally reach out to the families of fallen troops. In August 2012, he tweeted an accusation that Obama didnt actually sign some condolence letters himself because he was too busy playing golf. Trump was actually playing golf on Oct. 7 , the day one of the soldiers bodies was returned to Dover Air Force Base after the Islamic State ambush in Niger. Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

254,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roy-moore-trump-accusers_us_5a0b63d0e4b0bc648a0e8541","WASHINGTON <U+2015> Senate Republicans are increasingly lining up behind the women accusing Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore (R) of sexual misconduct, saying he shouldnt be able to serve given the disturbing allegations against him. The women who have come forward are entirely credible, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) declared Tuesday. Hes obviously not fit to be in the United States Senate. But ask those Republicans if they believe the women who accused President Donald Trump of sexual assault, and the conversation is over. Look, were talking about the situation in Alabama, McConnell told HuffPost, when asked about Trumps accusers. Id be happy to address that if there are any further questions. Moores scandal has put his party in an incredibly uncomfortable predicament: the more Republicans say the allegations by five women against Moore are proof that he doesnt belong in the Senate, the more hypocritical they look for ignoring the 16 women who have accused Trump of sexual assault and helping him become president. The White House position on the presidents accusers is that they are all liars . Trump denied all of the allegations again last month, calling them fake news and made-up stuff. So why do Republicans believe Moores accusers but not Trumps? HuffPost spent Tuesday asking GOP senators why the situations are different. Few could offer a convincing argument, instead opting to shrug their shoulders, pivot or abruptly walk away. Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kansas) said Moore should step aside because the women accusing him of misconduct appear to have the preponderance of the evidence. Asked if he believes Trumps accusers, Roberts replied, I dont know them. He started to leave but turned back and said, referring to Moores accusers, I dont know the others, either. Perhaps realizing his answers made no sense, Roberts turned back again and said with a smile, Or [Bill] Clinton. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) said Moores accusers certainly seem credible. He had a harder time responding to the allegations against Trump. Youre obviously asking what everybodys asking. You know, what about all these other folks, said Cassidy, before taking a lengthy pause. You know, I dont know. Without going into [Bill] Clinton, or Trump, or anyone else, Ill just stay with where I am with Roy Moore. Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) argued that the sheer volume and the level of detail thats been provided by Moores accusers draws enough conclusion for him to say the Alabama Republican ought to withdraw from the race. As for whether Trumps accusers should be believed, Burr said he was only addressing Roy Moore. Its no secret that Republicans dont want Moore in their ranks, and its not just because of the latest allegations against him. He thinks homosexuality should be illegal and compared it to bestiality . He fueled conspiracies about former President Barack Obama being born in Kenya. As chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, Moore was expelled from office <U+2015> twice <U+2015> for defying the U.S. Supreme Courts ruling on marriage equality and for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments statue from the courthouse. Perhaps most unnerving to Republicans, though, is that Moore has Steve Bannons support . Bannon, a former top aide to Trump and executive chairman of the conservative website Breitbart, is on a mission to dismantle the political establishment in Washington and sees Moores candidacy as a way to do it. Hes vowed to use his websites platform to try to unseat Republican incumbents in 2018 and wants McConnell out as majority leader. Thats arguably the biggest factor in Republicans siding with Moores accusers. GOP leaders are so desperate to keep Moore out, theyre exploring the idea of a last-minute write-in campaign for another Republican candidate, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions , who previously held the seat. Moores name, however, will still appear on the ballot as required by Alabama law <U+2015> prompting some Republicans to call for a vote to expel him if he wins the Dec. 12 special election. Weve looked at all the options, McConnell said Tuesday. For now, Republicans insist that Moores accusers are enough proof that he doesnt belong in the Senate <U+2015> even if they cant explain why they dont see Trumps accusers as just as credible. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) said he believes the women accusing Moore of sexual misconduct but threw his hands in the air when asked about Trumps accusers. I dont think in this particular case that there was a lot of disagreement among those individuals, so ... he said, trailing off. Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), one of four senators who endorsed Moores campaign, walked away without saying anything when asked if Trumps accusers deserve the same benefit of the doubt as the women who accused Moore of sexual assault. Im working on taxes right now and concentrating on that and heading to a meeting where I have to speak and thats what Im concentrating on, Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) told HuffPost, walking quickly down a Senate hallway. Asked if he has any thoughts at all on the Moore scandal, he replied, My thoughts are on taxes. If you want to talk about taxes. OK. Do you want to tax Roy Moore? asked HuffPost. Enzi said nothing and walked away.",1,63.39,8.5,11.2,865,53,"GOP Senators Believe Roy Moore's Accusers But Not Donald Trump's",2017-11-14 18:24:00,"Jennifer Bendery,Igor Bobic","Politics","@ads_sexy,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_politics,donald-trump,political-science,republican-politics,roy-moore,senate,sex-crimes,type: news,us-news,us-presidential-elections",296973,261965,296973,258059,33870,219152,1.035,1.135,0.955,1.013,185803,89892,21278,4257,253563,1869,6401,10638,7854,2766,2,10,16740,16120,421,55,144,"GOP Senators Believe Roy Moore's Accusers But Not Donald Trump's",2017-11-14 18:24:00,"Jennifer Bendery,Igor Bobic","Politics","@ads_sexy,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_politics,donald-trump,political-science,republican-politics,roy-moore,senate,sex-crimes,type: news,us-news,us-presidential-elections",296973,261965,296973,258059,33870,219152,1.035,1.135,0.955,1.013,185803,89892,21278,4257,253563,1869,6401,10638,7854,2766,2,10,16740,16120,421,55,144

Cruz slammed Elaine Duke, acting secretary of Homeland Security, over her Thursday comments, which lauded the amazing federal response to the disaster. I know its a hard storm to recover from, Duke told reporters outside the White House. But I know it is really a good news story in terms of our ability to reach people and the limited number of deaths that have taken place in such a devastating hurricane. But the situation continues to be dire as people in need await aid deliveries,said Cruz, who was shocked and appalled by Dukes statement. Maybe from where shes standing its a good news story, Cruz said on CNNs New Day Friday. When you are drinking from a creek, its not a good news story. Im sorry, but that really upsets me and frustrates me, she continued, holding back tears. Frankly, its an irresponsible statement. ...Damn it, this is not a good news story. This is a people are dying story. This is a life or death story. ... This is a story of a devastation that continues to worsen because people are not getting food and water. If I could scream it a lot more louder <U+2015> its not a good news story when people are dying when they dont have dialysis, and when the generators arent working and the oxygen is not providing for them. Where is there good news here? Its been more than a week since Maria ripped through Puerto Rico as a powerful Category 5 hurricane <U+2015> the strongest storm to hit the island in over 80 years.There have been at least 16 Maria-related deaths on Puerto Rico, though experts said they expect the death toll to rise as recovery efforts continue. President Donald Trump has come under fire over his response to the disaster. He tweeted over a dozen times last weekend about the NFL, yet didnt mention Puerto Rico once on the social media platform during that time. The president pushed back against claims from lawmakers who suggested he ought to spend more time focused on disaster relief and less on the football players protesting during the national anthem. I have plenty of time on my hands, Trump said Tuesday during a news conference when asked if he was too distracted by the NFL to focus on Puerto Rico.  All I do is work . The seemingly contradictory statements were followed up Friday with tweets, in which the president quoted Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossellos statement about the federal governments relief efforts. Cruz isnt buying it though. She made another desperate appeal to Trump on Friday, asking him to step up the response efforts and figure out a way to deliver much-needed aid to struggling Puerto Ricans, despite logistical issues. Thank you for calling San Juan yesterday and listening for our May Day call, said Cruz, speaking directly to Trump through CNN. There are 77 other towns that are waiting anxiously and will be very grateful to you and to the American people if you continue to step up to the moral imperative that you have taken on all over the world to help those in need. So help us, she continued. I know he can do it because he did it yesterday with San Juan. Somebody heard me. They just came to San Juan and things started moving and rolling. But this has to happen on a continuous basis for the entire island of Puerto Rico. Lets get it done. ... Lets put a crew of people out there with enough equipment and lets just push things out of the way and move. Where theres a will, theres a way. Isnt that the American way of doing things? You never get distracted by the obstacles and move ahead and push on and show the world what you can do. Lets show them.

During the daily White House press briefing,Miller expanded on a new Senate bill pertaining to immigration reform that would favor English-speaking applicants. CNNs Jim Acosta questioned Miller about whether that bill is keeping with American tradition and cited the most famous portion of The New Colossus: Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. Miller brushed off Acostas reference, arguing that the poem written by Emma Lazarus was added later and has no significance. I dont want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of liberty and lighting in the world; its a symbol of American liberty lighting the world. The poem that youre referring to was added later. Its not actually part of the Statue of Liberty, Miller argued. Its true that The New Colossus, which was never intended to be a statement of political policy, was added to the Statue of Liberty in 1903 and that the statue itself was dedicated in 1886. But they are widely associated with each other: The poem was written to help raise funds for the statues pedestal and is currently featured on a bronze tablet in the museum in the base of the Statue of Liberty. Sections of the National Park Services website about the statue are devoted to the poem and Lazarus. The poem was often cited earlier this year as Trump tried to ban people from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. During a rally against the travel ban, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the poem a statement of values of our country. Its a recognition that the strength of our country is in our diversity, that the revitalization constantly of America comes from our immigrant population, she said . In a 2011 poll by the Roper Center, 61 percent of Americans said they felt the Statue of Libertys message should apply to immigration policy.",1,46.71,12.8,13.5,366,15,"White House Distances Itself From The Poem On The Statue Of Liberty",2017-08-02 15:59:00,"Paige Lavender","Politics","@developing,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_ga,arts-and-entertainment,nancy-pelosi,statue-of-liberty,stephen-miller,the-new-colossus,type: news,us-news,white-house",295381,261497,295381,383204,32109,175076,1.137,1.107,1.688,1.834,131155,137340,26886,12482,151812,6692,38947,64933,56993,7529,5,29,55554,54430,980,32,112,"White House Distances Itself From The Poem On The Statue Of Liberty",2017-08-02 15:59:00,"Paige Lavender","Politics","@developing,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_ga,arts-and-entertainment,nancy-pelosi,statue-of-liberty,stephen-miller,the-new-colossus,type: news,us-news,white-house",295381,261497,295381,383204,32109,175076,1.137,1.107,1.688,1.834,131155,137340,26886,12482,151812,6692,38947,64933,56993,7529,5,29,55554,54430,980,32,112

When recession, severe inflation or other hard times engulf society, it is because the sacred equations have been angered. If we adjust the right variable just so, a set of very important numbers will respond appropriately, and a process of mystical, self-sustaining prosperity will begin. Knowledge of these secret statistical potions is closely guarded, and its practitioners deploy sophisticated abstractions to explain away common-sense calls for reform. Why do so many people work 60-hour weeks for poverty wages while a few luxuriate in the fabulous returns of interest-bearing assets? Why are the citizens of Puerto Rico threatened by a deadly social collapse while the fruit of the islands labor is shipped to Wall Street bondholders? The answer surely cannot be that some wealthy members of our society are exercising political power over the lives and incomes of others. We must consider growth, productivity, liquidity, gross domestic product and the debt-to-GDP ratio. But at the heart of every important economic issue are simple and straightforward power relationships. When you are in debt, someone else has financial power over the ordering of your affairs. Wealth enables rich people to buy their way out of troubles that overwhelm the lives of the poor. For much of our history, the American government granted some people the right to own other people. Economic problems are political problems. They have always been so; they can never be otherwise. And so in a perverse sense, President Donald Trumps most recent tax proposal is a great gift to society. It clears away much of the obfuscating hocus-pocus that leaders of both political parties have been busy constructing around our politics over the past 40 years. Trump wants a massive tax cut for the very wealthy. He doesnt really care how much it costs, or what it will do to the federal budget deficit, or to economic growth or to worker productivity. He isnt even very picky about how , exactly, taxes for the rich are reduced, so long as they are diminished by a very large amount. His framework suggests eliminating the estate tax, dramatically slashing corporate taxes, reducing the top rate on individual income taxes, and limiting the levies on special pass through accounts <U+2015> all perks that generate terrific sums for CEOs and hedge fund managers. If you want to tack on a few hundred dollars for middle-class families, Trump will not raise a fuss. We could describe this as a complex, disembodied economic idea <U+2015> the mathematical inelegance of extreme inequality or the fearful ratios implied by a ballooning deficit. But it is really a simple expression of power. The Trump tax plan is a public demonstration of the political priority the American government has decided to grant to the wealthiest members of our society. It is a clear, unequivocal statement that in America, some citizens are more equal than others. Everything else we can say about the plan with statistics is window-dressing. The billionaire donors cheering it on dont need the money. It will not make them wealthier in any meaningful sense. They will buy the same Herms scarves and Tom Ford s unnies they would have purchased without it. Their yachts will continue to be elegantly contoured and divinely upholstered. Many quite literally cannot use the money Trump wants to offer them. One of the biggest perks in Trumps proposed framework is the elimination of the estate tax <U+2015> a levy that falls not on the millionaires of today, but on the inheritances of their heirs and heiresses. A wealthy individual needs to leave behind over $5 million to trigger the estate tax. For a married couple, the figure is nearly $11 million. So Trump loves the rich so much he will cut their taxes even when they are dead. And the ultra-rich love Trumps plan because it is a formal political recognition of their social prestige, an acknowledgement that they carry more weight than others in the political system we still optimistically refer to as a democracy. This is, as they see it, how it should be. It has, after all, been the way of things for decades. In 2010, billionaire Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman was enraged by President Barack Obamas suggestion that taxes on private equity and hedge fund managers be increased from 15 percent to 35 percent <U+2015> the level that other wealthy people have to pay on their salaries. It was war, according to Schwartzman, who likened the plan to when Hitler invaded Poland. Obama settled for 23.8 percent. I believe one of the major things people want from politicians is psychic income, former House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) told HuffPost in 2014 . They want to be told that they are wonderful people, that their jobs are important for the human race, that they contribute greatly. Lloyd Blankfein was not really kidding when he said that, We are doing Gods work. Thats his inner feeling. I dont think that the [Dodd-Frank financial reform] legislation really hurt them much, and I think a lot of them, frankly, some of them welcome it because theyre not under competitive pressure to do stupid things  now, nobody can do them. But we really hurt their feelings mightily, particularly the president. Youve seen that with these ridiculous statements from Steve Schwarzman going on about Nazis. Frank was close, but not quite right. Many Wall Streeters did have their feelings hurt when Obama told CBS that he didnt run for president to protect the paychecks of fat cat bankers. But this was because the presidents words implied a political demotion. After years of being celebrated as Masters of the Universe, bankers were suddenly threatened with the prospect of becoming ordinary, humdrum members of a democracy; people whose actions might be subject to democratic forms of accountability. It must have been terrifying. Wall Streets very public freakout <U+2015> a fellow named Anthony Scaramucci implored Obama to stop bashing the Wall Street piata, and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon declared he could now barely tolerate calling himself a Democrat <U+2015> obscured the profound degree to which Obama was protecting Wall Street interests. Obama named a top lobbyist from JPMorgan Chase as his chief of staff. He and his attorney general, Eric Holder, steadfastly refused to prosecute what everyone knew to be widespread criminality on Wall Street during the 2008 financial crisis. The Obama foreclosure relief plan became a vehicle for big banks to harvest funds from desperate families through illegal foreclosures . Obama even protected the bonuses at AIG and big banks that received taxpayer bailouts. When vulture fund investors descended on Puerto Rico, forcing the closure of schools and hospitals in the name of debt payments, Obama waved through a half-hearted reform plan that preserved the political priority of bondholders over basic social services. These bailouts and bonuses and other protections were not only infuriating because bankers were rich. They divorced socially destructive activity from political accountability. You could enrich yourself by destroying entire communities <U+2015> you could even break the law to do it <U+2015> and face no meaningful consequences. Members of a democracy, it seemed to many people, ought to be able to protect themselves from such abuses. And yet studies by respected academics from Princeton, Northwestern University and the University of Connecticut concluded that the concerns of the wealthy dominate the congressional agenda. Some reporters on Capitol Hill noticed the same trend . But the idea has generally been dismissed by Washington officialdom, which prides itself on interpreting the mathematical codes and metaphors that show why simple problems of power are in fact very thorny economic matters. Paul Ryan, in particular, hypnotized D.C. journalists in the days before he became House speaker with pronouncements about debt and deficits. Ryans story conveniently excluded credit default swaps, proprietary trading and other high-risk activity on Wall Street. He warned of an inevitable debt crisis just around the corner if America didnt cut its spending <U+2015> particularly on social programs for the poor and elderly. This wasnt because he hated the indigent, mind you <U+2015> he merely recognized that we now had too many takers and not enough makers and were nearing a tipping point. He even found the magic number: If Americas public debt reached 90 percent of its gross domestic product, we were headed for another 2008, only worse. The figure, based on research from two prominent conservative economists, was eventually discredited by a lowly graduate student who discovered it was the result of a very simple Microsoft Excel error. Today, as Trump proposes massive tax benefits for the super-rich, the deficit hawks and austerity mongers have fallen strangely silent. The profound ratios and disequilibria that once threatened to dissolve society itself have disappeared now that they are being fueled by tax cuts rather than spending programs. We can have a political system that respects its citizens as political equals, or we can have a society dominated by the arbitrary interests of unaccountable wealth. Trump, like Obama before him, has chosen the latter. In the not-so-distant past, polities ruled by unaccountable wealth have demonstrated a marked tendency to generate less accountability and an astonishing capacity for statistical deception and logical absurdity. In 1929, the global economy was in terrible shape. There was a tremendous amount of work to be done <U+2015> highways to be built, telephone lines to be wired, electrical grids to be constructed <U+2015> yet millions of people were out of work. The British economist John Maynard Keynes co-authored a political pamphlet with a simple solution: The government could hire the unemployed people to do the work. Financiers in the city of London were aghast at the idea, and told the public that it was all much more complicated than Keynes suggested. If the government hired people, after all, it would deprive future generations of the chance to get a job. All of the work would already have been done. Keynes knew he wasnt proposing anything particularly clever, just trying to knock down silly ideas that people only took seriously because they were delivered by very prestigious people. Our main task, he wrote, will be to confirm the readers instinct that what seems sensible is sensible, and what seems nonsense is nonsense. No one in power listened to him then, and there will probably be plenty of Democrats and Republicans in Congress who shrug off critics of the Trump tax plan now. Our government, like those of the Gilded Age, likes to give the wealthy what they want. At least with Trump, we will not mistake a simple act of political domination for the music of the spheres.",1,51.38,11,13,1781,90,"Trump's Tax Plan Is An Act Of Political Domination By The Rich",2017-09-28 22:57:00,"Zach Carter","Politics","@health_adhd,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_national_beats,bailouts,banking,barack-obama,donald-trump,financial-reform,financial-regulation,financial-tools-and-resources,legal-issues,macroeconomics,microeconomics,must-reads,personal-taxes,political-commentary,political-science,type: news,us-government-resources,wall-street",292462,264323,292462,349768,35496,222090,1.06,1.091,1.273,1.338,173914,95115,23433,946,242344,1721,12127,7649,7030,514,18,9,12579,12200,251,43,85,"Trump's Tax Plan Is An Act Of Political Domination By The Rich",2017-09-28 22:57:00,"Zach Carter","Politics","@health_adhd,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_national_beats,bailouts,banking,barack-obama,donald-trump,financial-reform,financial-regulation,financial-tools-and-resources,legal-issues,macroeconomics,microeconomics,must-reads,personal-taxes,political-commentary,political-science,type: news,us-government-resources,wall-street",292462,264323,292462,349768,35496,222090,1.06,1.091,1.273,1.338,173914,95115,23433,946,242344,1721,12127,7649,7030,514,18,9,12579,12200,251,43,85

260,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mueller-adds-former-doj-lawyer-with-white-collar-crime-expertise_us_5981c4bee4b0353fbb33c7cc","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former U.S. Justice Department official has become the latest lawyer to join special counsel Robert Muellers team investigating Russias interference in the 2016 presidential election, a spokesman for the team confirmed. Greg Andres started on Tuesday, becoming the 16th lawyer on the team, said Josh Stueve, a spokesman for the special counsel. Most recently a white-collar criminal defense lawyer with New York law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, Andres, 50, served at the Justice Department from 2010 to 2012. He was deputy assistant attorney general in the criminal division, where he oversaw the fraud unit and managed the program that targeted illegal foreign bribery. Mueller, who was appointed special counsel in May, is looking into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the election, among other matters. Congressional committees are also investigating the matter. That Mueller continues to expand his team means the probe is not going to end anytime soon, said Robert Ray, who succeeded Kenneth Starr as independent counsel for the Whitewater investigation during the Clinton administration. Its an indication that the investigation is going to extend well into 2018, said Ray. Whether it extends beyond 2018 is an open question. The special counsel last month asked the White House to preserve all of its communications about a June 2016 meeting that included the presidents eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. Russian officials have denied meddling in the U.S. election, and Trump denies any collusion by his campaign. Among the cases Andres oversaw at the Justice Department was the prosecution of Texas financier Robert Allen Stanford, who was convicted in 2012 for operating an $8 billion Ponzi scheme. Before that, Andres was a federal prosecutor in Brooklyn for over a decade, eventually serving as chief of the criminal division in the U.S. attorneys office there. He prosecuted several members of the Bonanno organized crime family, one of whom was accused of plotting to have Andres killed. A graduate of Notre Dame and University of Chicago Law School, Andres was a Peace Corps volunteer in Benin from 1989 to 1992. He is married to Ronnie Abrams, a U.S. district judge in Manhattan nominated to the bench in 2011 by Democratic President Barack Obama. Others on the special counsel team include Andrew Weissmann, chief of the Justice Departments fraud section; Andrew Goldstein, former head of the public corruption unit at the U.S. Attorneys Office in Manhattan; and James Quarles, who was an assistant special prosecutor in the Watergate investigation that helped bring down President Richard Nixon.",0,52.49,10.6,13,431,23,"Mueller Adds Former DOJ Lawyer With White Collar Crime Expertise",2017-08-02 08:30:00,"Staff","Politics","@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_national_beats,allen-stanford,donald-trump,donald-trump-jr,fraud,new-york,robert-mueller,robert-ray,russia,type: news,us-department-of-justice,us-news,white-house",291745,264739,291745,429538,35557,222960,1.051,1.144,1.486,1.73,155577,106353,29815,2409,254044,1853,7385,4679,4154,504,NA,8,7260,7172,78,2,8,"Mueller Adds Former DOJ Lawyer With White Collar Crime Expertise",2017-08-02 08:30:00,"Staff","Politics","@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_national_beats,allen-stanford,donald-trump,donald-trump-jr,fraud,new-york,robert-mueller,robert-ray,russia,type: news,us-department-of-justice,us-news,white-house",291745,264739,291745,429538,35557,222960,1.051,1.144,1.486,1.73,155577,106353,29815,2409,254044,1853,7385,4679,4154,504,NA,8,7260,7172,78,2,8
261,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mass-shootings-las-vegas-gop_us_59d3ef64e4b04b9f9205baf4","Republicans on Tuesday struggled to identify ways that Congress could help prevent mass shootings in America. Some even argued there was no point in government making the attempt. I dont think this is a problem a law is going to fix by itself, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said. HuffPost asked several GOP senators about possible government action two days after a gunman in Las Vegas killed at least 58 people and wounded more than 500 others <U+2015> the deadliest such attack in modern U.S. history. Studies say mass shootings are becoming more frequent and deadly , so its likely only a matter of time before another bloody massacre spurs fresh calls for congressional action to curb gun violence. As Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) put it Tuesday on the Senate floor, How many of these can you have before you say enough is enough? For some Republicans, though, mass shootings are the price of freedom , as former Fox News host Bill OReilly put it. For others, the answer lies in preventing people with mental health problems from buying guns. Mental health reform is the critical ingredient to making sure that we can try and prevent some of these things that have happened in the past, House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin told reporters Tuesday . Earlier this year, however, Republicans rescinded an Obama administration regulation that had made it tougher for the mentally ill to get a gun. They claimed the rule, put into place after the 2012 mass shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, unfairly impeded the Second Amendment rights of people with disabilities. No GOP senators who spoke with HuffPost expressed support for broader gun control measures, such as limiting magazine capacity or banning assault weapons. Some sounded resigned about their inability to address gun violence <U+2015> which kills over 30,000 people a year. Sadly, violence will always be part of our lives, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said. People are going to have to take steps in their own lives to take precautions to protect themselves, said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota. Heres how the GOP senators responded to the question of what Congress can do to prevent mass shootings:  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) I think its particularly inappropriate to politicize an event like this, it just happened in the last day-and-a-half. Its entirely premature to be discussing legislative solutions, if any. Were in the middle of an investigation. Well see what that reveals. And at the end of that will be an appropriate time to discuss it. In the meantime, our priority is on tax reform, as my colleagues have indicated, were going to press ahead with that in the Budget Committee this week.  Cruz The facts are still developing, but it appears this was a crazed madman and sadly violence will always be part of our lives. But it underscores the need for more effective law enforcement and more effective measures to prevent domestic terrorism. And I expect in the coming days the facts will develop as to whether there were warning signs that should have led to further investigation of this individual before he carried out this horrific attack.  Graham I dont know, I mean, lets find out, see if you can establish a motive. I mean, I dont know why he did it. Any laws he broke, any loopholes and laws he took advantage of? Other than that Im just at a loss. I dont think this is a problem a law is going to fix by itself.  Sen. Richard Shelby (Ala.) I dont know if legislation can [prevent mass shootings]. We cry that everything is a government problem and a government solution. But everything is not. That was a terrible thing that happened, the worst thing Ive ever seen. But from what I read and seen on TV ... the man didnt have a prior record, had no problems, [passed] a background check [when buying weapons], had no apparent obstacles to him. So, were dealing with the human condition, sometimes it doesnt manifest itself very well. I dont know why anybody would want to kill anybody like that. But I dont know that the government can <U+2015> I tell you what we could do, is more checks in hotels, you know, just like itd be hard to take a gun [into Congress] because people are checking. I suppose, in the future when they build new buildings, theyre going to have to think about security. HuffPost: Do you want metal detectors on the doors of casinos? Thats up to them, but I would think of any way to protect my clientele.  Sen. Johnny Isakson (Ga.) First of all, you never accept the fact that you can [prevent mass shootings]. So Im not even going to address answering that question. The second thing you ask is what you can do to help prevent them, and thats why we have a Congress and Im on my way to debate those issues. But you should never accept the fact that you can do it.  Sen. Cory Gardner (Colo.) I just met with a group of Colorado behavioral health providers, something that has had great bipartisan success <U+2015> working on mental health needs and finding out whats happened. Look, I mean, we need information on what happened in this terrible tragedy in Las Vegas, I think, to figure out really what can be done.  Sen. Pat Roberts (Kan.) This is a rather unique situation. I dont know all the facts and I dont think we will for the next couple of days until we figure out what was behind all this. This is not your typical person <U+2015> to do something as heinous as this. At least today, its my understanding, that every firearm that he used is already illegal.  Sen. Bob Corker (Tenn.) I dont know, I really dont. Im all for looking at reasonable ways of ending mass killings. We always jump to something that has nothing to do with the event that just occurred. ...  Im like everyone else in our nation, Id like to see it stop. ... Im not in any way indicating that I know of some change that needs to happen, but hopefully the Judiciary Committee and Homeland Security Committee hearings will enlighten us. It always seems that what comes out legislatively had nothing to do with the last incident. Its an impetus for something to happen thats unrelated. I do hope well have a fulsome discussion about the threat that we have. You can imagine this happening at a [Southeastern Conference college] football game. I know nothing about the background of this person, or what it was that drove him to do this. But its a problem in a country that has the freedoms like we have, and so many mass events like that one was. I dont have the solution but Id be more than glad to listen to some.  Thune It sounds like he used conversion kits and other things, you know, to make these weapons more lethal. ... Well look at the facts when we get them all in here. I think that all of us want to do everything we can to prevent tragedies like that from happening again. You know, its an open society. And when somebody does what he wants to do, its going to be hard to prevent anything. But I think people are going to have to take steps in their own lives to take precautions to protect themselves and in situations like that, you know, try to stay safe. As somebody said: get small.

262,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-concentration-camps_us_59a19788e4b06d67e337f60d","President Donald Trump s pardon of former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio amounts to an endorsement of the idea of concentration camps, says a journalist who has reported on the global history of the deadly facilities. Arpaio referred to his own county jail as a  concentration camp . For over two decades, he operated Tent City, where detainees were kept in brutal conditions, including temperatures soaring well above 100 degrees Farenheit . They were also forced to work on chain gangs and to wear pink undergarments as a form of humiliation. Arpaio was convicted in July of criminal contempt for ignoring a court order prohibiting the detention of people based on mere suspicions about their legal status. In an email to HuffPost Saturday, Andrea Pitzer, the author of One Long Night: A Global History of Concentration Camps ,defined a concentration camp as a mass civilian detention outside the standard legal process, usually on the basis of race, ethnicity, or political activity. While Pitzer said Tent City was a prison technically constructed to hold those convicted by law, it bore familiar elements to a concentration camp, including brutal dehuminization. Once Arpaio began neighborhood sweeps and traffic stops deliberately targeting Latinos, and then detaining them without charges, his whole enterprise tilted further toward being a concentration camp for that set of detainees, she wrote. And even for those who had been convicted of crimes, it was a harrowing, often deadly experience. Pitzer said Trump pardoning Arpaio legitimized the 85-year-old former sheriffs operation. When it was just Arpaio and his deputies doing it, it was a freelance, loose-cannon operation. What happened yesterday is that the President of the United States put his position behind it and used executive power to bless these tactics, she wrote. Historically, when this kind of thing has happened, its encouraged other people to take up the same tactics.

And just in case anyone was going to go after him for not paying attention to the disaster, he attempted to pre-empt the criticism: He dedicated the trophy to the victims of the storm. On behalf of all the people in Texas and all of the people of <U+2015> if you look today and you see whats happening,how horrible it is, but we have it under really great control <U+2015> Puerto Rico, and the people of Florida who have suffered over this last short period of time with the hurricanes. I want to just remember them, Trump said. And were going to dedicate this trophy to all of those people that went through so much that we love, a part of our great state, really a part of our great nation, he added, before pivoting to talking about golf. And Ill tell you what <U+2015> Ive been watching this thing from the beginning. And I have to say, our Team USA,wow, did you play well. Trump made his remarks at the Presidents Cup golf tournament at Liberty National Golf Course in Jersey City, New Jersey. Trumps attempt to appear engaged by giving a shout-out to the storm victims made the optics of the whole situation even worse. A person at the ceremony yelled, You dont give a shit about Puerto Rico! according to reporters at the event. A golf trophy does nothing for the people who are struggling to recover after the devastating hurricane. Only 5 percent of Puerto Ricos electrical grid is back up and running, and it could be months before residents get regular service back. More than half the U.S. territory remains without drinking water. Trump is the first sitting U.S. president to present the trophy to the winning team, and the first sitting president to attend since 2000. Trump, however, loves golf. Last weekend, as the crisis in Puerto Rico was unfolding, the president spent time at his own private golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.Trump was there this weekend as well. Although his administration received praise for its response to the hurricanes that hit Florida and Texas, Trump has appeared more out-of-touch for Hurricane Maria. He and his top officials have insisted that they are doing a superb job responding, attracting harsh rebuttals from people who are actually on the ground. Elaine Duke, the acting head of the Department of Homeland Services, called what was happening in Puerto Rico  a good news story in terms of our ability to reach people and the limited number of deaths that have taken place. That assessment was quickly hit down by the mayor of San Juan, who was disgusted by the comments. Mayor Carmen Yuln Cruz said the hurricane was a people are dying story. Army Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, who is leading the military response to the hurricane, acknowledged that the response was so far  not enough . Trumps attempts to show his engagement in the recovery efforts have made him look even more out of touch. Besides dedicating a golf trophy, Trump tweeted an attack Saturday morning on the mayor of San Juan because she dared to criticize him: Trump has not yet been to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Maria, but he plans to visit the U.S. territory on Tuesday.

On Saturday morning, President Donald Trump unleashed a series of tweets taking aim at San Juan Mayor Carmen Yuln Cruz. In them, he accused Democrats of having convinced Cruz to be nasty to him , called Cruzs leadership poor and said that other leaders in Puerto Rico want everything to be done for them. The tweets were sent from his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey. In an interview with CNN later in the day, retired Lt. General Russel L. Honor tore down Trumps remarks: The mayors living on a cot, and I hope the president has a good day at golf, he told CNN. Honor said the crisis in Puerto Rico is even larger than what he faced during Katrina. Is Puerto Rico worse than what you found here in Katrina? CBS News correspondent Michelle Miller asked Honor on Friday. Oh, hell yeah, Honore said. The number one priority is saving lives and when youre saving lives, youve gotta figure out what rules youre gonna break. All the rules we live by are designed for peacetime. And this is what? Miller asked. This is like a war, he said. Army Lt. Gen. Jeff Buchanan arrived on the island Thursday after being appointed by the Pentagon to lead the relief effort there. So far, approximately 4,400 troops are on the island, he told CNBC Friday. He added that more are arriving to help, but its still not enough. Our capacity is growing but that doesnt mean that were getting all the right help to the people who need it, Buchanan said. For me, Harvey was monumental in Texas because of the amount of flood damage, Buchanan added. But the impact here is completely different. Its like an atomic bomb went off. With all of the wind impact knocking down trees, electrical lines <U+2015> its just a very different disaster. Honor said the military response to the 3.5 million people without power and supplies should have happened much sooner. Not giving the mission to the military was the first mistake, Honor said in his interview with CBS. Look, we got Army units that go do port openings. Not called. We got special forces that couldve been in every town. Not employed. In another interview with CNN, Honortied Trumps response to a overall lack of compassion to marginalized people.

Chris Baldridge told the publication that a few weeks after his 22-year-old son, Army Cpl. Dillon Baldridge, was gunned down by an Afghan police officer on June 10, he had a 15-minute phone call with the president. Baldridge said he told Trump of his struggle with the manner in which his son was killed, according the Post story, and was offered $25,000 after telling the president about his frustration with the militarys survivor benefits program. Baldridge said he can barely rub two nickels together, and that his ex-wife would receive the Pentagons $100,000 death gratuity because she was his sons beneficiary. According to the Post story:[Trump] said, Im going to write you a check out of my personal account for $25,000, and I was just floored, Baldridge said. I could not believe he was saying that, and I wish I had it recorded because the man did say this. He said, No other president has ever done something like this, but he said, Im going to do it. But Baldridge told the Post he had not yet received a check yet. He said he did receive a condolence letter from the administration, adding that he opened it up and read it ... hoping to see a check in there. I know it was kind of far-fetched thinking. But I was like, Damn, no check. Just a letter saying Im sorry, he told the Post. Shortly after the Post story appeared on the newspapers website Wednesday, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said that a check was sent, but it was not made clear when that was. The story comes on the heels of backlash Trump is taking from some Gold Star families, who called the presidents delayed response to the Oct. 4 deaths of U.S. soldiers in Niger  an abdication of his first duty as commander in chief to recognize the sacrifices of the troops and their families . Trump waited more than a week to address the incident, and a call he made to the widow of one of the soldiers killed has become shrouded in controversy. Myeshia Johnson, the wife of Army Sgt. La David Johnson, received a call from Trump on Tuesday and her conversation with the president was overheard via speakerphone by Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.). Wilson said that Trump remarked on the phone,  But you know he must have known what he signed up for.  How could you say that to a grieving widow? Wilson said. And he said it more than once. I said this man has no feelings for anyone. This is a young woman with child who is grieved to her soul. Trump denied that he made the comments and said Wilson fabricated her claim. I have proof,Trump tweeted, although he has not offered that evidence.

267,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-tax-bill-technical-corrections_us_5a380422e4b01d429ccb49c8","WASHINGTON <U+2015> Republicans wrote their massive tax legislation in such a rush that even before theyve sent it to the presidents desk, theyre already talking about writing another bill to fix all the mistakes in the first one. Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), the lead author of the tax legislation in the House of Representatives, said Friday that he expected Congress would need to draft another bill to maketechnical corrections. I cant imagine any major undertaking like this that doesnt require technical corrections in the future, Brady told reporters . Republicans have repeatedly adjusted major provisions of their legislation over the past several weeks. The final version of the bill released Friday contained yet more significant changes to a business deduction that tax experts have warned could result in a lot of creative accounting and unintended consequences. Technical corrections to major legislation are indeed common, but usually they aim to fix errors that lawmakers discover after passing a bill <U+2015> not ones they assume exist beforehand. Steven Rosenthal, a lawyer and tax expert who formerly worked for the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, said he was not aware of any other instance in which lawmakers anticipated technical corrections for tax legislation that had not even been enacted. This legislation is tax policy malfeasance, Rosenthal said. Brady said he hoped Democrats would go along with fixing the tax bill post-passage <U+2015> a curious request since it wasnt so long ago that Republicans wanted nothing to do with corrections for another piece of major legislation: the Affordable Care Act. Obamacare contained drafting errors and mistakes, including one that nearly proved devastating to the laws implementation <U+2015> a passage that didnt specify whether tax credits for buying health insurance should be available in all states or just some.A simple one- or two-word change to the laws language would have cleared up the ambiguity. Rather than working with Democrats to enact such a measure, so that it had the votes to pass Congress, Republicans supported a lawsuit that, if successful, would have cut off the tax credits for millions <U+2015> leaving most of them with no health insurance at all. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court, which slapped it down by a 6-3 vote. But that history may loom large if or when Republicans turn to crafting technical fixes for the tax bill. GOP lawmakers are enacting the tax bill itself through the budget reconciliation process, which means that it can pass with a simple majority and no threat of a filibuster <U+2015> an essential requirement for the Republicans, because they have only 52 seats in the Senate now and that drops to 51 once Doug Jones takes the Alabama seat now occupied by a Republican.But a bill fixing the tax legislation next year would not necessarily have the same advantage of the lower Senate vote threshold, meaning Republicans could need Senate Democrats to get it done. We can do even more to improve this tax code, Brady said. Im hopeful Democrats, whove always said theyre for tax reform but today are defending the status quo, I hope they rethink that and work with us to improve the code. As congressional committees have written and rewritten parts of the GOP legislation over the past month, lobbyists and tax experts have already identified multiple apparent drafting errors that Republicans subsequently fixed , such as a mistake in the Senate bill that could have allowed employees to claim a deduction intended only for business owners. But its not just additional little mistakes that Republicans might need to address going forward. There could be major substantive problems, too, because of policy choices made in the hasty construction of the bill. For instance, the House and Senate bills both eliminated deductions for state and local income taxes, but allowed filers to continue deducting what they pay in property taxes up to a $10,000 limit. The new joint bill, which combines the House and Senate versions, would allow filers to deduct a mix of property and income taxes up to that same amount. Limiting deductions is important because that offsets federal revenue loss, by more than $600 billion over 10 years, from the lower tax rates and other breaks in the legislation. But state governments, to defend their own budgets,could take actions that undermine that tradeoff. The effort to curb state and local tax deductions in particular would put pressure on states, since they could lose political support for taxes that can no longer be deducted on voters federal tax returns. States might protect their revenue by reducing taxes on individual income and property while increasing taxes on business payrolls, which businesses could still deduct. And since the joint tax legislation would still let individuals take deductions for charitable donations, states might let people make deductible donations in exchange for a state tax credit. Many states already have laws in place granting state income tax credits for donations to certain funds, and the IRS has allowed taxpayers who take advantage of these credits to deduct their payments as charitable contributions rather than as state taxes, a group of tax scholars wrote in a paper published Monday,  The Games They Will Play , which identifies a wide array of tax avoidance ploys that could be fostered by the GOP tax bill. If states simply shift how they gather taxes, and households and businesses wind up deducting as much in local levies from their federal tax returns as they do currently, then the tax legislation would increase federal budget deficits by $600 billion more than Republicans intend. But Darien Shanske, a tax professor at the University of California Davis School of Law and one of the scholars who wrote that paper, suggested that the potential revenue loss is not necessarily something Republicans would act to fix,given that their legislation would already add more than $1 trillion to the national debt. They clearly dont care about the deficit,Shanske said. The provision thats probably gone through the most mutations, and the one experts say is ripest for abuse, is a new deduction for certain types of business income. Republicans wanted to cut business taxes, but since most commercial enterprises arent taxed as corporations, cutting corporate tax rates wasnt enough. So lawmakers added a tax break for owners of pass through firms whose business income is taxed on their individual returns<U+2015> a deduction worth 20 percent of qualified business income. If those kinds of firms end up paying a much lower effective tax rate than wealthy individuals do, high earners will have a strong incentive to find a way to reclassify their personal income as business profit. People with high incomes could turn themselves into pass-through business entities for tax purposes, despite provisions of the legislation that Republicans describe as guardrails to prevent such gaming. The Senate bill had a list of business types not eligible for the new break, including doctors, lawyers, engineers, architects or any trade or business where the principal asset of such trade or business is the reputation or skill of one or more of its employees. The final bill resembles the Senate version, but for some unknown reason, engineers and architects have been removed from the list of those restricted from taking the full deduction. The final bill also contains a new provision allowing pass-through companies to count the value of physical property toward their deduction <U+2015> an apparent gift to the real estate industry. Sorting out what type of businesses qualify for the pass-through deduction will be a major challenge for the Internal Revenue Service, one compounded by budget constraints and a short timeline. Republicans aim to pass the law this week, and then it would go into effect Jan. 1. The concept of allowing lower tax rates on income that passes through a partnership or that is earned by an independent contractor is completely novel, Rosenthal said. This experiment is completely untested.",1,41.13,15,15.5,1315,44,"Republicans Already Say They'll Need Another Bill To Fix Their Tax Mistakes",2017-12-18 17:01:00,"Arthur Delaney,Jonathan Cohn","Politics","@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@sponsor_msnbcpolitics,@team_us_enterprise_politics,accounting,business-management,kevin-brady,legal-issues,microeconomics,personal-taxes,political-science,senate,taxes,type: news,us-government-resources,us-news",287543,234355,287543,216162,27506,148458,1.092,1.13,1.157,1.232,129220,130258,28065,28335,131772,15246,47235,27444,23925,3069,79,41,21976,21197,584,111,84,"Republicans Already Say They'll Need Another Bill To Fix Their Tax Mistakes",2017-12-18 17:01:00,"Arthur Delaney,Jonathan Cohn","Politics","@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@sponsor_msnbcpolitics,@team_us_enterprise_politics,accounting,business-management,kevin-brady,legal-issues,microeconomics,personal-taxes,political-science,senate,taxes,type: news,us-government-resources,us-news",287543,234355,287543,216162,27506,148458,1.092,1.13,1.157,1.232,129220,130258,28065,28335,131772,15246,47235,27444,23925,3069,79,41,21976,21197,584,111,84
268,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-mccain-puerto-rico-jones-act_us_59caebd1e4b02aef6cd6061d","UPDATE: Sept. 28 <U+2015> The White House announced Thursday that Trump waived the Jones Act for Puerto Rico for 10 days, effectively immediately. PREVIOUSLY: WASHINGTON <U+2015> Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is urging acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke to take an action that could significantly help Puerto Rico amid its unfolding humanitarian crisis: waive the Jones Act. The law requires that all goods shipped between U.S. ports be carried by American-owned and operated ships. That means Puerto Rico pays double the shipping costs for goods from the U.S. mainland compared to neighboring islands. DHS has gotten emergency waivers to the Jones Act twice in the last months in response to recent hurricanes, and McCain says Duke should waive the law again to speed up relief efforts on the island decimated last week by Hurricane Maria. It is unacceptable to force the people of Puerto Rico to pay at least twice as much for food, clean drinking water, supplies and infrastructure due to Jones Act requirements as they work to recover from this disaster, McCain said in a Tuesday letter to Duke. We must treat this emergency relief with urgency <U+2015> every day that business owners are unable to recover their assets and account for lost business, the economy will retreat even further into devastation. Heres the full letter: DHS was not receptive to McCains request. DHS spokesman David Lapan declined to comment specifically on McCains letter. But he said DHS ability to waive the Jones Act is limited to national defense purposes, and that its previous waiver was targeted specifically at disruptions in the oil supply system resulting from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The fuel concerns associated with Hurricane Harvey were driven by the loss of numerous refineries and the shutdown of the primary pipeline moving refined fuel to the East Coast and Southeast. In those cases, we needed additional vessel capacity to make up for those losses, Lapan told HuffPost. We do not lack U.S.-flagged vessel capacity to move commodities to Puerto Rico. Asked for comment on Puerto Rico having to pay twice as much for supplies at a time when it is economically and geographically devastated, Lapan said the department has not analyzed the potential cost savings of waiving the Jones Act since that is not material to our decision-making. A group of eight House lawmakers reached out to Duke on Monday with the same waiver request as McCain. DHS did not appear supportive. McCain has been trying to repeal the Jones Act for years. He introduced a bill in 2010 to get rid of it, and then again in July. The law, formally known as the Merchant Marine Act, was enacted in 1920 to protect the U.S. shipping industry from foreign competitors. But critics say it is archaic and note that it costs Puerto Rico hundreds of millions of dollars every year. In his letter to Duke, McCain said that now is the time more than ever to curb the harmful effects of the law on Puerto Rico. Since Hurricane Maria hit last week, at least 13 people have died and most of the 3.5 million Americans there dont have water, power or cell service. Just two weeks earlier, Hurricane Irma blew through and caused as much as $1 billion in damages to the island. (Click here to donate money to help).

269,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-justice-department_us_5970cdfce4b0aa14ea783baf","WASHINGTON <U+2015> It became pretty clear this week that President Donald Trump doesnt seem to know much about how the Department of Justice operates, or much about some of the people he nominated to key positions at DOJ. Trumps comments to The New York Times indicate he either doesnt know or doesnt care about the normal limits on the relationship between the White House and the Justice Department . And that has a lot of DOJ alums from both sides of the aisle worried. In his remarkable interview with the Times this week, Trump said he would have picked somebody else if he knew before he nominated him that Attorney General Jeff Sessions was going to recuse himself from the Russia investigation, which Trump described as very unfair to the president. Trump claimed <U+2015> inaccurately <U+2015> that the F.B.I. person really reports directly to the president of the United States, a false assertion he called interesting. Trump went on to reveal that he knew very little about Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man he appointed to the crucial No. 2 position in the Justice Department. Trump repeatedly said that Rosenstein was from Baltimore, and complained that there are very few Republicans in Baltimore. (Rosenstein, in fact, is a Republican. He was born in Philadelphia, has lived in the D.C. suburb of Bethesda, Maryland, for years, and spent much of his career working in the U.S. capital, except for when he commuted to Baltimore as U.S. attorney for Maryland.) This week certainly isnt the first time Trump violated DOJ norms. His direct overtures to former FBI director James Comey and former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara blurred the divisions between DOJ and the White House and made both men uncomfortable. There was the unusual sight of a U.S. attorney speaking from the White House press room. And Trump met directly with his nominee for U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, which CNN reported on Thursday was virtually unheard of in past administrations. But his comments this week on Sessions, Rosenstein and special Counsel Robert Mueller went even further beyond the pale for many Justice Department veterans. And Trumps comments came as The Washington Post reports that the president is trying to learn more about his pardon power. Its not just Obama administration veterans who have concerns. John F. Wood , an attorney with the law firm of Hughes Hubbard & Reed who served as a counselor to the attorney general and as U.S. attorney for the Western District of Missouri during the George W. Bush administration, told HuffPost he found Trumps comments unusual and a break with the traditional restrictions between the White House and DOJ. I could not imagine President Bush saying something like that about really anyone who worked for him, Wood said. I think it hurts morale. I think it is disruptive, and it undermines the attorney general within the Justice Department. That said, I think people also recognize that President Trump changes his mind frequently, and so you never know if next week hes gonna say something very supportive of Jeff Sessions. While Sessions brushed off resignation talk on Thursday morning,Bharara said he thinks Trumps comments make it next to impossible for him to do his job. Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates said that Trumps attack on Sessions recusal on Russia reveals yet again his violation of the essential independence of DOJ, a bedrock principle of our democracy. And former Attorney General Eric Holder said that Trump cant define or constrain the Mueller investigation.Doing so would create constitutional, and criminal, issues, he said. Wood said Trumps comment on Sessions probably makes people a little bit nervous about taking positions in the administration, but there are certain positions such as U.S. attorney that are highly sought after,despite Trumps statements. But I have heard that there are some positions that the Justice Department is having some trouble filling, Wood said. He said that while he thinks that many Trump White House staffers are more aware of the limitations on DOJ contacts, the president is not. I think its certainly correct that the president is not really familiar with the traditional lines between the Justice Department and the White House, Wood said. The president himself is used to shooting from the hip and doesnt know that theres some things that hes better off not getting involved in. In a series of tweets Saturday , Trump insisted he had complete power to pardon and questioned why the Justice Department wasnt investigating Hillary Clinton or former FBI director James Comey.",0,61.46,9.2,12.5,763,42,"Trump Does Not Acknowledge Or Respect DOJ's Independence.

But for Donald Trump , Hurricane Harvey has been a golden opportunity to promote himself. We want to be looked at in five years, in 10 years from now as, this is the way to do it , the president said on Tuesday. We want to do it better than ever before. Right now, however, Trump wants to be looked at in a way that makes people say, I would really like to wear that hat, and Id be willing to pay that man $40 for it. The president has repeatedly worn his own campaign merchandise , which is on sale at his website, to Hurricane Harvey events. Nearly every chance he gets, Trump brags about the size of his hurricane. He doesnt have to deal with just any old storm like his predecessors did <U+2015> he is confronting a huge storm. The biggest storm youve ever seen. A storm that only he could handle. And of course, he wants everyone to know that he and his administration are doing a heckuva job . Trump also continued to tout how many supporters he has, and the size of his crowds, which he also does at nearly every campaign rally. On Tuesday, he remarked on the crowd size while visiting Corpus Christi, saying,  What a crowd, what a turnout . He was at a fire station to meet with local officials about the disaster response. It was not a rally. Reporters at the event heard no mention from the president of the dead, suffering or displaced Texans, nor did they hear Trump express any sympathy for them, according to a Dallas Morning News reporter. Trump seems to be taking a certain amount of satisfaction from the attention he and the hurricane are getting on TV, where cable news has nearly non-stop coverage. On Tuesday, Trump boasted that Federal Emergency Management Director Brock Long has really become very famous on television over the last couple of days. And he defended his decision to pardon controversial Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio during Harvey, saying he did so because of how many people were tuning in: I assumed the ratings would be far higher . On the same day that Trump was tweeting about the size of the hurricane, his great rescue operation, NAFTA and his insistence that Mexico will pay for the border wall, former President Barack Obama tweeted a donation link to the Red Cross.

At that meeting, he was told, he could obtain some official documents and information that would incriminate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Trump Jr., President Donald Trumps eldest son,released the images just as The New York Times published a story describing the emails. An editor for the Times confirmed that Trump Jr. posted the emails after being informed of the Times story. In an email sent to Trump Jr. on June 3, 2016, music promoter Rob Goldstone said he could facilitate a meeting to provide Trump Jr. with information that would be very useful to your father, at the time a Republican presidential candidate. The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father, Goldstone wrote in an email to Trump Jr. This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its governments support for Mr. Trump <U+2015> helped along by Aras and Emin, Goldstone added. What do you think is the best way to handle this information and would you be able to speak to Emin about it directly? Trump Jr. replied, If its what you say I love it. The documents posted by Trump Jr. show that he forwarded the email exchange to Trumps son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is now a presidential adviser, and to Paul Manafort, Trumps then-campaign manager, on June 8 <U+2015> one day before the meeting took place at Trump Tower in New York. As The New York Times notes, theres no evidence in the emails to suggest the meeting was related to the Russian hacking of Democratic National Committee emails, many of which were provided to WikiLeaks and released over the last few months of the presidential campaign. Tuesdays revelation comes after an earlier New York Times story on Trump Jr.s meeting with the Kremlin-linked lawyer.In response to that story, published Saturday, Trump Jr. claimed he primarily discussed an adoption program with the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, whose clients have included Russian state-owned businesses and the son of a senior Russian government official. Trump Jr.changed his statement a day later, admitting he attended the meeting to obtain potentially helpful information about Clinton. The president has so far remained silent on the controversy, tweeting instead about Senate Democrats, the Olympics and a military plane crash .Mark Corallo, the spokesman for the presidents personal lawyer, told The New York Times on Sunday that the president  was not aware of and did not attend the meeting.

272,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/climate-change-report-draft-nyt_us_598907ece4b0a66b8bae1fc6","WASHINGTON  Contrary to President Donald Trump and his teams repeated claims, government scientists agree that climate change is already having a dramatic effect in the U.S. In a nearly 700-page draft report , scientists from 13 federal agencies conclude that the planet has rapidly warmed over the last 150 years, triggering many other changes to Earths climate, and find it extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.  Evidence for a changing climate abounds , from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans, states the fifth and final draft of the report, still under review and posted this week by The New York Times. Thousands of studies conducted by tens of thousands of scientists around the world have documented changes in surface, atmospheric, and oceanic temperatures; melting glaciers; disappearing snow cover; shrinking sea ice; rising sea level; and an increase in atmospheric water vapor. Rainfall patterns and storms are changing and the occurrence of droughts is shifting, the report reads.Many lines of evidence demonstrate that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are primarily responsible for the observed climate changes in the industrial era, especially over the last six decades. The draft,completed this year and part of the National Climate Assessment, has already been approved by the National Academy of Sciences , according to the Times. Its official release hinges on the Trump administration s approval. On Monday, the Times published a story about a previous third draft, which it said had not been made public. One scientist who worked on the report told the Times that he and others feared the president would withhold it.On Wednesday, however, the Times issued a correction noting that, while not widely publicized, the report was uploaded by the nonprofit Internet Archive in January. Indeed, the third draft of the report  which the Times based its article on  has been available for months and was even open for public comment, as co-authors pointed out on Twitter. It also continues to be available by request from the National Academy of Sciences. The Times subsequently published the fifth and final draft. Katharine Hayhoe , a co-author of the report and professor of political science at Texas Tech University, told HuffPost in an email Wednesday that the fifth draft is undergoing its final interagency review, which ends Aug. 18. The final draft, she said, differs from the third in that it includes revisions made in response to the National Academy of Sciences review. While the substantive messages did not change between the 3rd and 5th drafts, responses to NAS comments included adding new figures and references, expanding some sections of the text, and condensing others, she wrote. According to the latest draft, scientists predict the average annual temperature will continue to rise throughout the century. Over the next two decades alone, global temperatures could increase between 0.5 and 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit. With very high confidence, the scientists concluded that the magnitude of climate change beyond the next few decades will depend primarily on the amount of greenhouse (heat-trapping) gases emitted globally and on the remaining uncertainty in the sensitivity of Earths climate to those emissions. Since 1880, global sea levels have risen 8 to 9 inches, according to the draft report. In a post to Twitter, Gavin Schmidt, a climate scientist and director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said that nothing in the report is surprising for people working in the field but that it may be shocking to those that think [climate change] is just a future problem. The report delivers a strikingly different message than the one being pushed by Trump and his Cabinet members, who continue to downplay the urgency of the threat as they work toward energy dominance. Since taking office, Trump  who famously called climate change  bullshit  and a Chinese hoax   has moved quickly to derail Americas actions to combat climate change , including rolling back President Barack Obama s Clean Power Plan , a policy limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. Trump has pegged himself as a savior of Americas dying coal industry and has vowed to increase oil and gas production, opening now-protected areas of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans to drilling. In June he announced plans to pull the U.S. out of the historic Paris Agreement on climate change <U+2015> the international accord in which nearly 200 countries committed to slashing carbon emissions in an effort to prevent global temperatures from increasing 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels,the line scientists say the world must stay below to stave off the very worst effects of climate change. Meanwhile, his Cabinet members have refused to say whether Trump believes climate change is real and continue to question how much the scientific community understands about the threat and the role humans play in observed changes. In March, Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt told CNBC,  No, I would not agree that [carbon dioxide is] a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. And in June, Energy Secretary Rick Perry echoed Pruitts comments , saying no when asked by CNBC whether he believes carbon dioxide is the primary control knob for the temperature of the Earth and for climate. Most likely the primary control knob is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in, Perry said.I mean, the fact is, this shouldnt be a debate about, Is the climate changing? Is man having an effect on it? Yeah, we are. The question should be, you know, just how much, and what are the policy changes that we need to make to affect that? Perry went on to defend his and others denial of near-universally accepted climate science, suggesting that those who question the scientific communitys findings are more intelligent. Also in June, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said glaciers in Montanas Glacier National Park started melting  right after the end of the Ice Age  and that it has been a consistent melt. He also dismissed the notion that government scientists can predict with certainty how much warming will occur by 2100 under a business-as-usual scenario. How the Trump administration decides to handle the report remains to be seen.The EPA and 12 other agencies have until Aug. 18 to approve the report. During George W. Bush s presidency, federal scientists were discouraged from talking about climate change and even had climate change research altered .

A Manafort spokesman confirmed the raid to ABC News . FBI agents executed a search warrant at one of Mr. Manaforts residences, he said in a statement. Mr. Manafort has consistently cooperated with law enforcement and other serious inquiries and did so on this occasion as well. Manafort had no advance warning about the raid, which took place July 26. According to the Post, documents and other materials were seized. Manafort is a key figure in the investigation into the Trump campaigns ties to Russia. One day before the raid, Manafort met with Senate Intelligence Committee investigators to discuss a meeting of a Russian lawyer and members of Trumps campaign team that took place during the 2016 presidential election. Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni said the former campaign chairmananswered their questions fully. On June 27, Manafort retroactively registered as a foreign agent thanks to$17.1 million his firm was paid from 2012 to 2014 for lobbying work he did on behalf of a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine. Manafort ran Trumps campaign in 2016 from March to August, when he resigned after questions were raised about that work. Special counsel Robert Mueller has enlisted a grand jury in Washington, D.C., to advance his Russia investigation. Grand juries can be used as legal tools in cases where there is the possibility of criminal conduct , but their use doesnt necessarily signify criminal charges will be brought.

274,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/net-neutrality-rules-repealed_us_5a31a282e4b01bdd7659c5c4","In a victory for internet service providers like AT&T, Comcast and Verizon, the Federal Communications Commission voted Thursday to repeal net neutrality rules. FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai , who was appointed by President Donald Trump , forged ahead with the vote,despite widespread opposition and a request from 18 state attorneys general to delay it over concerns that the public comment process was corrupted by fraudulent messages.The repeal proposal passed 3-2 on party lines. The hearing was temporarily delayed  and the room evacuated  by a bomb threat before Pai could cast the fifth and final vote. Commissioners were permitted to continue after police and dogs searched the empty chamber. The repeal rolls back so-called Title II regulations that classified the internet as a public utility, and which, among other things, required internet service providers, or ISPs, to treat all of the data traveling on their networks equally. Without the protections of Title II, those ISPs can now legally begin treating data from some websites differently than others. So Comcast, for instance, could charge customers who use Netflix extra for using so much bandwidth; AT&T could, in theory, decide to block access to some websites entirely; or Verizon, which owns HuffPosts parent company Oath, could hypothetically decide wireless customers wont be charged data when theyre viewing HuffPost content. (HuffPosts union is represented by the Writers Guild of America, East, which supports net neutrality and opposed its repeal.) Immediately after Thursdays vote, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman pledged to sue to halt the FCCs actions. In Congress, Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) joined with 15 other senators to contest the FCC decision via a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution. We will fight the FCCs decisions in the courts, and we will fight it in the halls of Congress, Markey said in a statement . With this CRA, Congress can correct the Commissions misguided and partisan decision and keep the internet in the hands of the people, not big corporations. Large tech companies like Netflix and Twitter also reiterated their support for the now-defunct rules. In a conference call with reporters Wednesday ahead of the vote, telecom industry executives sought to calm the storm of public opinion. Michael Powell, the head of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association and a former FCC chairman, argued that just because its now legal for ISPs to discriminate against internet traffic and create fast lanes doesnt mean they will. We cant live by a principle that just because there isnt a rule banning something, it doesnt mean necessarily that something is going to happen, he said. There are a lot of things in our society we dont expressly prohibit, but it doesnt mean that theyre going to happen, he added. Theres no law that says I cant paint my house hot pink, but I assure you I have no intention of doing it. He called arguments to the contrary  that ISPs are only repealing net neutrality rules so they can engage in the sort of behavior that would otherwise have been prohibited  a very lazy and unfounded way of looking at the problem. While ISPs have previously pledged not to prioritize web traffic in this manner, under the new rules, customers cant do much but take them at their word. And their word is no ironclad guarantee. Last week, Comcast quietly altered a net neutrality pledge that had been on its website since 2014, removing a promise that it wouldnt prioritize internet traffic or create paid fast lanes and replacing it with a much more cautious pledge to not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content. If Comcast decides on a whim to change its pledge again next week,it absolutely can. In addition to repealing net neutrality, the new FCC rules also strip state and local governments of the power to enact their own laws regulating broadband service. That provision alarmed a group of nearly five dozen mayors from across the political spectrum, who signed a public letter last week slamming the FCCs actions as a stark, inexplicable, and unwarranted attack on the constitutional principles that lie at the heart of our system of government. A collective of internet activist groups that have united under the banner of Team Internet  responded to the repeal by calling on Congress to review and overturn the FCCs action. The telecom industry spent millions lobbying and spreading misinformation to pit Internet users against each other and turn net neutrality into a partisan issue, the group said in an emailed statement to HuffPost. They have failed. Net neutrality has more public support now than it ever has before. Internet users are educated, outraged, and strategic, and they know that Congress has the power to overturn the FCC vote, the statement continued. Lawmakers cannot hide from their constituents on this issue. The Internet has given ordinary people more power than ever before. Were going to fight tooth and nail to make sure no one takes that power away.",1,48.33,12.2,13.4,820,36,"FCC Repeals Title II Net Neutrality Protections Amid Uproar",2017-12-14 13:13:00,"Ryan Grenoble","Politics","@health_depression,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_huffpost_now,comcast,federal-communications-commission,huffington-post,industries,net-neutrality,news-and-politics,type: news",284603,228060,284603,411984,36066,171023,1.099,1.271,1.734,2.034,155965,111207,17431,4329,204022,3046,17632,25552,23961,1549,16,2,33128,32623,338,122,45,"FCC Repeals Title II Net Neutrality Protections Amid Uproar",2017-12-14 13:13:00,"Ryan Grenoble","Politics","@health_depression,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_huffpost_now,comcast,federal-communications-commission,huffington-post,industries,net-neutrality,news-and-politics,type: news",284603,228060,284603,411984,36066,171023,1.099,1.271,1.734,2.034,155965,111207,17431,4329,204022,3046,17632,25552,23961,1549,16,2,33128,32623,338,122,45

Schwartzs Twitter tirade was the most recent sign of strife between Scaramucci and Priebus, who first butted heads during the Trump transition in January. The latest spat comes after HuffPosts Vicky Ward wrote that Priebus warned Trump during the transition that Scaramucci played him by cashing in on his association with the president. Hey @Reince, wrote Schwartz, a former public relations executive at MWW Group LLC,on Twitter. Remember when people told you that it was me that was trashing you in the press? They were right. Happy to start again. In another cryptic tweet, Schwartz added, @Reince - youre unemployed now. Keep pushing this crap & Ill start dropping oppo on you. What the tweets were referring to is unclear. Hours later, Schwartz deleted them and said that he had apologized to Priebus. But CNN anchor Jake Tapper on Saturday afternoon contradicted Schwartzs earlier tweet about Priebus receiving an apology from Schwartz.  Schwartz was previously quoted as Scaramuccis publicist and as a GOP operative by The New York Post . After journalists began referring to him as such on Twitter, Schwartz said that was incorrect and threatened legal action. No. I have never worked for Anthony, he said on Twitter, in response to CNNs Jake Tapper. Keep it up and youll be hearing from counsel. In fact, Schwartz continued, [Scaramucci]called to yell at me & told me to cut it out. The bad blood between Scaramucci and Priebus spilled into the open on Thursday, when Scaramucci blasted Priebus in an expletive-laden interview with The New Yorker as a  paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac . Trump was reportedly unhappy with Priebus decision not to fight back, and on Friday decided to appoint a new chief of staff, Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly.",0,62.78,8.7,12.2,321,19,"Scaramucci Friend Threatens To Leak Dirt On 'Unemployed' Reince Priebus",2017-07-30 12:14:00,"Igor Bobic","Politics","@amazonecho,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_national_beats,anthony-scaramucci,arthur-schwartz,reince-priebus,twitter,type: news,us-news",282942,260087,282942,247740,30544,151916,1.05,1.095,1.191,1.38,79073,168770,35099,19175,143752,10063,13372,80435,70867,9422,91,NA,8902,7914,835,147,6,"Scaramucci Friend Threatens To Leak Dirt On 'Unemployed' Reince Priebus",2017-07-30 12:14:00,"Igor Bobic","Politics","@amazonecho,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_national_beats,anthony-scaramucci,arthur-schwartz,reince-priebus,twitter,type: news,us-news",282942,260087,282942,247740,30544,151916,1.05,1.095,1.191,1.38,79073,168770,35099,19175,143752,10063,13372,80435,70867,9422,91,NA,8902,7914,835,147,6
276,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-judicial-nominee-grasz-unqualified_us_59fa1df9e4b0b0c7fa37aa85","WASHINGTON <U+2015> Two days after the American Bar Association rated Leonard Steven Grasz not qualified to be a judge, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a confirmation hearing Wednesday for Graszs nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. It was brutal. With Grasz sitting in front of the committee, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) read aloud passages from the ABAs eight-page statement outlining why Grasz earned such a terrible and rarely designated rating by the nations premier legal society. I assume youre keenly aware that you are the first Circuit Court nominee since 2006 to receive a unanimous not qualified rating from the ABA? Whitehouse asked Grasz. And that the last nominee who had such a rating was withdrawn? That is my understanding, senator, replied Grasz. Awkward! It only got worse. Do you think that this is a matter as to which the committee should have no concern? asked Whitehouse. I have great respect for the amount of time and effort the American Bar Association put into the process, said Grasz. I respectfully disagree with the result. The Rhode Island senator noted that the ABA rated Grasz not qualified in a unanimous 14-0 vote. He asked Grasz if he knew that was the tally. Im not keenly aware of that, said Grasz. I believe there was one abstention. Thats why its 14, Whitehouse replied. There are 15 of them.... Its the full panel of 14 non-abstaining lawyers. The ABA interviewed several colleagues of Grasz, who was Nebraskas chief deputy attorney general for 11 years, as part of its evaluation of his fitness to be a judge. Some described him as gratuitously rude. Others expressed an unusual fear of consequences if they said anything bad about him because of his deep connection and allegiance to powerful politicians in Nebraska. ABA members also raised concerns that Grasz would be unable to separate his role as an advocate from that of a judge, given his record on such issues as abortion. Among other things, he defended Nebraskas ban on partial-birth abortion, and, in a 1999 article, he argued that lower courts should be able to overrule Supreme Court decisions on abortion rights because abortion jurisprudence is, to a significant extent, a word game. In sum, the evaluators and the Committee found that temperament issues, particularly bias and lack of open-mindedness, were problematic, reads the statement submitted by Pam Bresnahan, the chair of the ABAs standing committee that reviews nominees. The evaluators found that the people interviewed believed that the nominees bias and the lens through which he viewed his role as a judge colored his ability to judge fairly. White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley defended Graszs nomination. Steve Grasz is an outstanding lawyer, who has the full-throated support of the President, both U.S. Senators from Nebraska, and lawyers on each side of the political spectrum, Gidley told HuffPost in a Wednesday statement. The ABA claims to be non-partisan, but the facts show it cannot be trusted to fairly evaluate exceptional nominees. Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), who recommended Grasz to Trump, told the Senate committee she was shocked by the ABA rating. She said she didnt come across one single temperament issue when she talked to Nebraskans about Grasz. I am sad to say that, after thoroughly examining the substance of the ABAs report, it is evident to me the ABA evaluation of Mr. Grasz was a baseless political character assassination, Fischer said. But Whitehouse pointed out that 40 of the 42 judicial nominees Trump has put forward so far have gottenqualified or well qualified ratings by the ABA. (Charles Goodwin, Trumps pick for a district court in Oklahoma, was the other nominee rated not qualified.) It would be hard for the committee to ascribe the outcome in this case to a general partisanship of the ABA process, said the Democratic senator. It would not be consistent with the facts. Its up to the White House to decide if it wants to plow ahead with Grasz. If the president doesnt withdraw his nomination, the Judiciary Committee could vote to advance him to the full Senate in a matter of weeks. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who chairs the committee, said Wednesday that he invited ABA representatives to testify at a Nov. 15 hearing about their Grasz rating. They accepted, he said, so that hearing will happen before Grasz is scheduled for his committee vote.

Its up to us to do everything we can (to) build more ladders of success for every child and family thats willing to work hard. Second, American leadership in this world really is indispensable.

Regardless of the push and pull of daily politics, its up to us to leave those instruments of our democracy at least as strong as we found them.

279,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-border-wall-daca_us_59ba570ee4b0edff971983ee","WASHINGTON <U+2015> President Donald Trump gave a series of conflicting statements on Thursday about how he hopes to deal with young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, muddying the waters over whether he will support their bid to gain eventual citizenship and whether he will demand a border wall in exchange. Trumps comments, made both to reporters and on Twitter,came after leading Democrats in Congress said they had reached an informal deal with the president on legislation to help so-called Dreamers, or undocumented young people who entered the country as children. Last week, Trump put the fates of hundreds of thousands of Dreamers up in the air by rescinding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program , which granted two-year work permits and deportation relief. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said on Wednesday that they had reached an agreement with Trump to tie measures to grant Dreamers legal status to border security measures, but not to a wall. They said Trump had made clear he would continue to demand a wall, and that they had told him they would oppose it. Trump denied that a deal had been made, although he initially did not dispute key details of what the Democrats had said. But later, he said Dreamers fates would be tied to the construction of a border wall, even if its not part of legislation that addresses Dreamers. We have to be sure the wall isnt obstructed, because without the wall, I wouldnt do anything.  It doesnt have to be here but they cant obstruct the wall if its in a budget or anything else, Trump told reporters in Florida, according to a pool report. He added that he wouldonly do it if we get extreme security, not only surveillance but everything that goes with surveillance, Trump said. If theres not a wall, were doing nothing. The president also created more confusion by suggesting that he might not support allowing Dreamers to eventually gain citizenship. That would destroy any hope of a deal with Democrats, who want Trump to support the Dream Act, which would allow undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children to eventually become citizens. Were not looking at citizenship, he said. Were not looking at amnesty. Were looking at allowing people to stay here. That doesnt necessarily preclude eventually supporting Dream Act-style measures, however. The bill would not grant citizenship immediately; it would allow Dreamers to gain legal status that would make them eligible for eventual citizenship <U+2015> so theres potential that Trump could eventually back such measures and still claim they were not the amnesty he opposes. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) similarly insisted that there was no deal on Dreamers. He said on Thursday that Trump told him there was no agreement made with Democrats. It was a discussion, not an agreement or a negotiation, Ryan said. Ryan laid out his own conditions on Dreamers: You cannot fix DACA without fixing the root cause of our problem. We do not have control of our borders.So we need border security and enforcement as part of any agreement. Earlier on Thursday,Trump said in a series of tweets that any deal on Dreamers would be contingent on massive border security,although he didnt specify that it had to include a wall. He added that the wall is already under construction in the form of new renovation of old and existing fences and walls and would proceed. Trump also told reporters outside the White House on Thursday that  the wall will come later . Asked if he favors amnesty, the president replied that the word is DACA, referring to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The president also seemed to throw cold water on concerns that he wanted to deport beneficiaries of the DACA program. Pelosi and Schumer confirmed in their statement on Thursday that no final deal had been put in place. But they added,While both sides agreed that the wall would not be any part of this agreement, the President made clear he intends to pursue it at a later time, and we made clear we would continue to oppose it. Many of Trumps staunchest supporters, including Fox News Host Sean Hannity and conservative commentator Ann Coulter, quickly lashed out at reports that president seemed to be softening his stance on immigration. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders later tweeted that excluding the wall was certainly not agreed to , but a spokesman for Schumer shot back that, while the wall wasnt dead yet, it wasnt part of this deal specifically.

As a result, it will be harder for unions and workers to file complaints against fast-food chains or other big companies that rely on franchisees and contractors to oversee work. The two Democratic members dissented. Earlier this year, McDonalds was put on trial as a potential joint employer so that it might be held responsible for violating the rights of workers employed by its franchisees. That case has not been ruled on yet, and the change in precedent Thursday could knock a hole in the workers argument. While business groups cheered the policy change, labor groups and Democrats condemned it as a setback for worker rights. This shocking and brazen decision to overturn pro-worker precedent is further proof the Trump Administration will stop at nothing to line the pockets of corporations  no matter what price workers and their families are forced to pay, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the Senates labor committee, said in a statement after the ruling. The NLRB is an independent agency that referees disputes between employers and unions, though the policies it sets affect all private-sector workers, whether theyre in unions or not. Trump recently filled two vacancies on the board with Republican picks, flipping the board from liberal to conservative for the first time in eight years. The board under President Barack Obama issued a number of decisions that enraged employer groups, the joint employer ruling chief among them. The then-liberal majority said that companies shouldnt be able to dodge their responsibilities to workers by using subcontractors or franchisees. If a company at the top of the contracting chain exerts control over the working conditions at the bottom, they reasoned, then it should qualify as an employer. The ruling Thursday reverts to an older standard for joint employment that makes it harder to hold the company at the top accountable. The National Restaurant Association, a leading industry lobby, said Thursday that it applauds the new ruling. Todays decision restores years of established law and brings back clarity for restaurants and small businesses across the country.",0,48.64,12.1,13.8,405,18,"Trump Delivers A Favor For The Fast-Food Industry",2017-12-14 22:17:00,"Dave Jamieson","Politics","@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_enterprise_business,barack-obama,business-and-finance,donald-trump,mcdonalds,national-labor-relations-board,national-restaurant-association,trade-unions,type: news,workers-rights",280017,152596,280017,92013,21339,122602,1.065,1.139,0.598,0.644,183467,75503,21047,6369,123028,4186,114005,8093,5166,2787,13,2,3925,3786,65,46,28,"Trump Delivers A Favor For The Fast-Food Industry",2017-12-14 22:17:00,"Dave Jamieson","Politics","@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_enterprise_business,barack-obama,business-and-finance,donald-trump,mcdonalds,national-labor-relations-board,national-restaurant-association,trade-unions,type: news,workers-rights",280017,152596,280017,92013,21339,122602,1.065,1.139,0.598,0.644,183467,75503,21047,6369,123028,4186,114005,8093,5166,2787,13,2,3925,3786,65,46,28

However, the validity of those comments was questioned on Monday when The Washington Post reported that Trump had personally dictated the response his elder son would use to address the media. The presidents lawyer Jay Sekulow appeared on a series of Sunday news shows last month to defend the commander in chief following reports that Trump Jr. had met with attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya after being promised damaging information about 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton . At least twice Sekulow denied that the president had anything to do with the statement his elder son had issued. The statement caused a firestorm in the media because it was so different from those Trump Jr. had made in the previous 24 hours . I do want to be clear <U+2015> the president was not involved in the drafting of the statement and did not issue the statement, Sekulow told NBCs Chuck Todd on July 16. It came from Donald Trump Jr. ... It was, in fact, from him and I believe it was his lawyer was in consultation. Four days earlier, in an interview on ABCs Good Morning America, Sekulow said the president didnt sign off on anything and wasnt involved with the statement. Donald Trump intervened in his teams planned response to the Trump Jr. revelation and crafted it himself while aboard Air Force One, according to The Washington Post. This was . . . unnecessary, a Trumps adviser told the Post. Now someone can claim hes the one who attempted to mislead. Somebody can argue the president is saying he doesnt want you to say the whole truth. Many Twitter commentators pointed out the paradox between Sekulows words and the Posts reporting, which cited several people with knowledge of the event. On July 11, one day before Sekulow first hit the airwaves, The New York Times had reported that the president signed off on Trump Jr.s original statement . It was only after the Times followed up in preparation for another article that Trump Jr. issued a second (conflicting) statement. Sekulow issued a one-line statement in response to the latest story in the Post. Apart from being of no consequence, the characterizations are misinformed, inaccurate and not pertinent, it reads. Alan Futerfas, an attorney for Trump Jr., did not comment specifically on the report. But he told the Post he had no evidence to support that theory of the president intervening to write the statement.

In fact, the only public event on the presidents schedule on Tuesday is a photo op before a meeting with GOP congressional leaders on tax reform. Big week coming up! Trump said in a Twitter post on Monday evening. Many unanswered questions remain about the administrations plans for the program, such as whether any of the approximately 800,000 current DACA recipients can continue renewing their permits, or whether young undocumented immigrants can still apply for a permit within the next six months. Then there is the matter of a legislative fix <U+2015> will Republicans in Congress pass a bill to shield so-called Dreamers from deportation? Will the president sign it into law?

Franken, who is now the junior Democratic senator from Minnesota, was headlining the event. Tweeden was emceeing. Tweeden said Thursday that she knew ahead of time that Franken had written a skit where his character tries to kiss her. On the day of the show Franken and I were alone backstage going over our lines one last time,Tweeden wrote in a post for 790 KABC, the radio station she works for in Los Angeles. He said to me, We need to rehearse the kiss. I laughed and ignored him.Then he said it again. I said something like,Relax Al, this isnt SNL... we dont need to rehearse the kiss. He continued to insist, and I was beginning to get uncomfortable. She finally relented, she said: We did the line leading up to the kiss and then he came at me, put his hand on the back of my head, mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth. I immediately pushed him away with both of my hands against his chest and told him if he ever did that to me again I wouldnt be so nice about it the next time. I walked away. All I could think about was getting to a bathroom as fast as possible to rinse the taste of him out of my mouth. I felt disgusted and violated. She did end up performing the skit as written, she continued, turning her head away while on stage so Franken couldnt kiss her. When Tweeden was on her way home to Los Angeles, she said, she fell asleep on the plane. While she slept, Franken grabbed her breasts and had a photo taken. I couldnt believe it. He groped me, without my consent,while I was asleep, she wrote. I felt violated all over again. Embarrassed. Belittled. Humiliated. How dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think its funny? Franken, who was elected to the Senate in 2008, responded to Tweedens account in a press statement Thursday. I certainly dont remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann, he said. As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasnt. I shouldnt have done it. He later issued a longer statement,apologizing to Tweeden and calling for an ethics investigation of his behavior. I respect women. I dont respect men who dont. And the fact that my own actions have given people a good reason to doubt that makes me feel ashamed, Franken said. USO confirmed to HuffPost that the incident was never reported to them. We have no knowledge of it, public relations director Ashley McLellan said in a statement. The report is deeply disturbing and does not reflect the values of the USO. At a news conference Thursday afternoon , Tweeden explained why she didnt speak out at the time. I wanted to speak out 11 years ago, but people said, You will get annihilated and never have a career again, Tweeden said. And I was afraid of that. But Im not afraid of that anymore. This is happening in Middle America... to women who have no power and say to speak up, she added. I think the tide is turning. But what about all the women who dont have microphones and a voice? Tweeden also described the aftermath of the USO performance. I had to act my way through the rest of the shows, she said. I made sure I was never alone with him again. I didnt tell the sergeant of the Army. What was I gonna do, be the troublemaker? I just sucked it up. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called for an Ethics Committee review of the allegation. Regardless of party, harassment and assault are completely unacceptable <U+2015> in the workplace or anywhere else, McConnell said. Democratic senators including Sherrod Brown (Ohio), Richard Blumenthal (Conn.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) reacted to Tweedens account. I know [Franken] said it was inappropriate, and I agree, Brown reportedly told CNN . Sexual harassment and groping are never okay and are never funny, Blumenthal said . Gillibrand reportedly expressed support for an investigation into Tweedens allegations. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) echoed the call for an ethics investigation. Sexual harassment is never acceptable and must not be tolerated, Schumer said in a statement. I hope and expect that the Ethics Committee will fully investigate this troubling incident, as they should with any credible allegation of sexual harassment. Last month, following a whirlwind of accusations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, Franken wrote in a Facebook post about the disappointing responses women often receive after sharing their stories. He also said he was working to pass the Arbitration Fairness Act, which would allow people who have faced workplace harassment to go to court. Mike Sacks, a political correspondent for Scripps and former producer for HuffPost, noted on Twitter that in Frankens book Giant of the Senate , he says he decided to run for public office after the 2006 USO tour. Sgt. Thomas Day was stationed at Camp Arifjan in Kuwait in 2006 and took photographs of Franken the day he performed at the base with Tweeden, he told HuffPost. He said he doesnt recall the skit itself, but does distinctly remember a conversation he had with one of Frankens staffers about his plans to run for Senate. It was certainly a political move taking that trip. I recall that he was friendly, he was very in character, Day said. He was never untoward toward any of the troops or any of the women that were accompanying him. I guess Im as shocked as anybody to see some of the stuff but I didnt follow him around throughout the day. Day said it was common for celebrities and elected officials to perform acts that included sexual innuendos. Folks would kind of say things that [troops] would perceive as allowing them to be one of the guys, meaning that I am quite sure that things would be said that they certainly would not say or do in social circles in Manhattan or Los Angeles that they thought would be acceptable in social situations among the troops, he said. Perhaps thats because 85 to 90 percent of the folks they would interact with were young men. Jennifer Bendery and Sarah Ruiz-Grossman contributed reporting.

The lesson was delivered during a Tuesday interview with CNNs Jake Tapper. When Tapper asked why Moore believed that Muslim Americans should be barred from Congress, Crockett said it was because the former judge thinks its unethical for Muslims to swear on the Bible. You have to swear on the Bible to be an elected official in the United States of America, Crockett claimed. Then Tapper informed the campaign spokesman that elected officials can be sworn in on any text of their choosing. Crockett, a former county commissioner, was left speechless. He froze for over seven seconds, which can feel like forever on live TV. You dont actually have to swear on a Christian Bible, Tapper told Crockett. You can swear on anything, really. Crockett pushed back: Oh no, I swore on the Bible. Ive done it three times, Jake. Tapper replied by reminding Crockett that the Constitution does not require officials to use a Bible during their oath ceremonies: The law is not that you have to swear on a Christian Bible. That is not the law. After the excruciating silence, Crockett attempted to redeem himself by pointing out that President Donald Trump was sworn into office with the Bible, but Tapper noted that was Trumps own choice <U+2015> not the Constitutions. And the CNN host is absolutely right. Article VI, clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution says that state and federal officials in the legislative, executive and judicial branches are required to take an oath or make an affirmation that they will support the Constitution. But they are not required to identify with any religion, including Christianity: The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States. When Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), a Muslim, took office in 2007, for example, he exercised his constitutional right to religious freedom and took a ceremonial oath using a Quran once owned by Thomas Jefferson . Other lawmakers have taken their oaths on the Constitution itself. After Crocketts interview aired, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), the first Hindu elected to Congress, pointed out which religious text she used to take her oath: the Bhagavad-Gita.

We are actively investigating this situation and I am personally involved in getting to the bottom of this. Verizon declined to share the photo or video that showed the marcher, and neither turned up in a search of wire service images and social media networks. The protest became a political flashpoint this week after President Donald Trump initially refused to condemn, then later defended, the white nationalist demonstrators and said some very fine people had been among them. One rally attendee is accused of killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer by driving his car into a crowd of counterprotesters. Verizon owns Oath, HuffPosts parent company. McAdam did not specifically call out Trump in his short statement. The 63-year-old has remained mostly silent on the presidency, although he warned last October that Trump would be unpredictableand said the election made him want to put my head through the wall. He gave two $2,700 donations to the presidential campaign of 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, according to data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics. He has contributed regularly to Democrats and Republicans running for Congress. The president came under blistering criticism from major corporate allies this week. The White House disbanded two advisory councils on Wednesday after members began quitting en masse in protest of Trump. Together, they had been stacked with more than two dozen chief executives from companies including Walmart, Under Armour and JPMorgan Chase. In a separate crackdown against white supremacists, tech companies began shuttering services to people involved in the so-called Unite the Right rally. Alphabet Inc.s Google and GoDaddy banned The Daily Stormer, a prominent neo-Nazi website, from their hosting services. Web security provider CloudFlare also dropped the site. PayPal and Apple cut off their payment services to suspected white supremacists. Some smaller companies, including a hot dog shop in Berkeley, California, moved quickly to terminate employees who participated in the march . Verizon, however, appears to be the first major corporation investigating a potential marcher in its ranks. The company has more than 163,400 employees worldwide. The leadership team and I cannot be more committed to the values of diversity and inclusion, McAdam wrote. And we will continue to live those values through our actions. Verizons announcement comes shortly after members of the far-right criticized Google for firing James Damore, an engineer who wrote a memo railing against the value of workplace diversity. The company was forced to cancel a town hall on gender diversity <U+2015> Damore specifically called out women for being biologically unsuited for the same jobs as him <U+2015> amid threats from right-wing commentators.

Guthrie expressed skepticism that the bill would lead to higher pay for workers, and to buttress her point she quoted former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg: CEOs arent waiting on a tax cut to jump-start the economy <U+2015> a favorite phrase of politicians who have never run a company <U+2015> or to hand out raises, wrote Bloomberg in an op-ed earlier this month . Its pure fantasy to think that the tax bill will lead to significantly higher wages and growth. Guthrie then pushed Ryan, asking: Ill ask you plainly, are you living in a fantasy world? Ryan insisted surveys show that the huge corporate tax cuts at the center of the GOP bill will spur business leaders to pay people more money, higher wages. Senate Republicans passed the bill early Wednesday , and the House is poised to give it final approval later in the day and send it to President Donald Trump. Ryans efforts to defend the measure come amid one new poll showing only 24 percent of Americans think its a good idea. Attacks on the bill include that it benefits the wealthy, as opposed to the dwindling middle class, and that it will add an estimated $1.6 trillion to the governments deficit. On ABCs  Good Morning America  on Wednesday, Ryan rebuffed the criticism about the bill not helping the middle class. I think minds are going to change and I think people are going to change their view on this, he said. On the Today show, he told Guthrie that it isnt possible to predict how the tax bill would affect the deficit. Guthrie referred to Ryan as a longtime budget hawk, and asked:Are you saying that the growth youre going to get from this tax cut will equal the amount it would cost on the deficit side so that its a wash, so that youre not adding to the deficit at all because of this? she asks. Nobody knows the answer to that question because thats in the future, he said. But what we do know, this will increase economic growth. He went on to say that many Americans areliving paycheck to paycheck, and that another group of people in this country are about one check away from living paycheck to paycheck, and the U.S. needs faster economic growth so that people can get ahead. Thats what were doing, Ryan said. The average tax cut for the median family of four in America is going to be $2,059. $2,000, if youre living paycheck to paycheck, is a serious tax cut. Journalist Soledad OBrien responded to Ryans comment with a tweet noting that a family of four that gets a $1 million dollar tax cut and a family of four with zero tax cut has an average of half a million in tax cuts. Projecting deficits, meanwhile, is always a matter of looking into the future, so Ryans answer on the issue skirted the key question of the tax bills impact of the governments red ink. Rep. Rod Blum (R-Iowa) told HuffPost in October that, sadly, it doesnt seem in [Washington] that people are very concerned about the debt or the deficit anymore. Blum, though, has supported the tax bill. And as the clock runs down to the measure becoming law,it doesnt seem as if Blum or Ryan are concerned either.",0,65.25,9.8,10.4,594,26,"Paul Ryan Asked If He's 'Living In A Fantasy World' Amid His Defense Of Tax Bill",2017-12-20 10:52:00,"Jenna Amatulli","Politics","@health_depression,@health_gad,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_huffpost_now,paul-ryan,personal-taxes,political-science,type: news,us-news",277074,230576,277074,375210,28411,170658,1.093,1.145,1.573,1.907,157755,102453,16866,9754,184618,6082,25524,23347,21425,1797,8,6,17823,17674,75,12,62,"Paul Ryan Asked If He's 'Living In A Fantasy World' Amid His Defense Of Tax Bill",2017-12-20 10:52:00,"Jenna Amatulli","Politics","@health_depression,@health_gad,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_huffpost_now,paul-ryan,personal-taxes,political-science,type: news,us-news",277074,230576,277074,375210,28411,170658,1.093,1.145,1.573,1.907,157755,102453,16866,9754,184618,6082,25524,23347,21425,1797,8,6,17823,17674,75,12,62
290,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jared-kushner-russian-lawyer_us_59664aa9e4b005b0fdca6b34","As attention focuses on Donald Trump Jr. for meeting with a Kremlin-connected lawyer to obtain negative information about Hillary Clinton, its easy to overlook how damaging and embarrassing the episode is for Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump s son-in-law and one of his closest advisers. Kushner attended the June 2016 meeting in New York, along with Trumps then-campaign manager, Paul Manafort. Kushners lawyers recently discovered he failed to disclose it on a form he submitted to obtain a security clearance, according to The New York Times. Last Saturday, the Times broke the story on the meeting. Trump Jr. told Fox News Sean Hannity on Tuesday night that Kushner attended the meeting with the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, for just a few minutes before he left. Kushners lawyers reportedly have amended his security clearance form to disclose the meeting. But that wasnt the only such omission by Kushner. He maintains a security clearance even though he failed to mention multiple meetings with Russian officials on the form he submitted before the Trump administration took office. Those meetings were with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the U.S., and the head of a Russian-owned bank. Knowingly omitting such information is a crime; Kushners lawyer has said the omissions were just an error . Also raising questions about Kushners security clearance is a McClatchy report detailing investigations in Congress and by the Justice Department into whether the Trump campaigns digital team, overseen by Kushner, directed Russian operatives to key states. McClatchy reported DOJ investigators are skeptical that Russians spreading fake news would have known the areas to target on their own. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Wednesday called on Kushner to resign, saying he knowingly allowed Trump and Vice President Mike Pence to falsely say that no one in their campaign had contacts with Russian officials. You dont think the Republicans would be calling for the resignation of an Obama official who allowed the president and vice president to openly lie about a major national security issue? Murphy told reporters on Capitol Hill. He watched his father-in-law on TV say no one in [Trumps] campaign talked to the Russian government. Kushner knew that was false, Murphy said. Either he didnt alert the president and vice president, or there is a much bigger problem, and the president and vice president knew they were lying. There is a crisis of trust that the White House has to deal with. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said Kushner should probably lose his security clearance. Thats the decision the president gets to make, he said,in response to a question about whether Kushner should step down. Let me put it this way: If he were not related by marriage to the president, I think hed already be gone. Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.)also called on Kushner to resign on Monday. The presidents legal team is reportedly frustrated by the way Kushner has advised Trump on the probes into alleged collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign while not being entirely forthcoming about his own activities that have drawn scrutiny. The New York Times reported Trumps legal team sees Kushner as an obstacle more concerned with his own self-interest than that of the president. Like his father-in-law, Kushner had no direct experience with a presidential campaign prior to the 2016 race. He was one of Trumps most trusted advisers on the campaign trail and has continued to serve in that capacity in the White House. But Kushner allies now believe his lack of political experience may be hurting him . Everything is being treated as bigger than it is, but hes in the big leagues now, a Republican Kushner ally told Axios . Hes trying to bravado his way through his lack of experience. The president has given Kushner an expansive White House portfolio that includes working on peace negotiations in the Middle East and overhauling government bureaucracy. CORRECTION: This article has been amended to reflect that Schatzs remark about the decision the president gets to make came in response to a question about whether Kushner should step down, and was not in reference to whether he should retain his security clearance.",0,52.09,10.7,13.6,687,36,"Meeting With Russian Lawyer Just Latest Alarming Revelation About Jared Kushner",2017-07-12 14:11:00,"Sam Levine,Igor Bobic","Politics","@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_gad,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_ga,donald-trump,jared-kushner,legal-issues,republican-politics,type: news,us-news,us-presidential-elections",276501,236230,276501,437103,38635,188468,1.065,1.198,1.782,1.949,154431,95692,26378,6890,210159,20089,15766,2765,2219,529,NA,7,2716,2567,121,3,25,"Meeting With Russian Lawyer Just Latest Alarming Revelation About Jared Kushner",2017-07-12 14:11:00,"Sam Levine,Igor Bobic","Politics","@health_depression,@health_erectile,@health_gad,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_ga,donald-trump,jared-kushner,legal-issues,republican-politics,type: news,us-news,us-presidential-elections",276501,236230,276501,437103,38635,188468,1.065,1.198,1.782,1.949,154431,95692,26378,6890,210159,20089,15766,2765,2219,529,NA,7,2716,2567,121,3,25

Charlie Rose asked Bannon, appearing on 60 Minutes in his first televised interview since departing the Trump administration on Aug. 18, if rumors were true that he had described Comeys firing as the biggest mistake in political history. That probably would be too bombastic, even for me,Bannon said, but maybe modern political history. He added that Comeys departure directly spawned the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation into possible collaboration between the Trump administration and Russia to interfere in the 2016 election. I dont think theres any doubt that if James Comey had not been fired, we would not have a special counsel, Bannon said. We would not have the Mueller investigation and the breadth that clearly Mr. Mueller is going for. Bannon, largely credited with shaping the White Houses policy since Trumps inauguration, left the administration last month and returned to Breitbart News, the right-wing website he ran from 2012 until he took a leave of absence in 2016 to join the Trump campaign. During the interview, Bannon also lambasted the pearl-clutching mainstream media and said he is absolutely going to war with Republican leaders, who he said were trying to nullify the 2016 election. Theyre not gonna help you unless theyre put on notice, Bannon said, specifically pointing to Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Theyre gonna be held accountable if they do not support the president of the United States. Right now, theres no accountability. Earlier on Sunday, Politico reported that Bannon was planning to aid primary challenges against GOP senators who are unsupportive of Trumps agenda. Bannon, who described himself in the interview as a street fighter, also said the government needed to focus on American citizens when Rose asked about his position on DACA , the Obama-era program that offers some protections to young undocumented immigrants. America was, in the eyes of so many people, and its what people respect America for, it is people have been able to come here, find a place, contribute to the economy, Rose said. Thats what immigration has been in America. And you seem to want to turn it around and stop it. You couldnt be more dead wrong, Bannon countered. America was built on her citizens ... This countrys gonna be greater, more united, more powerful than its ever been ...This is not astrophysics, ok? And by the way, thats every nationality, every race, every religion, every sexual preference. As long as youre a citizen of our country.

Newman appeared on Trumps reality TV show The Apprentice and later on the sequel Celebrity Apprentice.

Kelly said the president was already informed and he signed off [on her firing]. Newman allegedly began acting very vulgar and eventually had to be escorted from the premises.

293,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-voter-fraud-investigation_us_5957c971e4b0da2c7323d93c","President Donald Trump cast doubt about the neutrality of a commission he created to investigate election integrity, tweeting that it was a probe focused on voter fraud. Critics have warned that the creation of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity is just a way of looking for voter fraud, which several previous probes have found is not a widespread problem. Trump himself confirmed those fears when he labeled the probe a voter fraud panel in a tweet Saturday morning and suggested election officials <U+2015> including at least one Republican <U+2015> were concealing information about illegal voters. The White House has sought to present the panel, created in May, as a bipartisan, neutral effort to investigate confidence in elections. In a conference call mapping out logistics for the commission this week, Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), who are leading the commission, told commissioners they were open to whatever the commission would find and didnt want anyone to have preconceived notions about what its conclusions would be. Appearing on MSNBC Friday, Kobach, who has a history of stoking fears about voter fraud , said the purpose of the panel wasnt to confirm Trumps unsubstantiated claim that millions voted illegally in the 2016 election. Kobach said Friday we may never know if thats true. Trumps revealing tweet came after several states refused to comply with the commissions request for voter information, saying they would not assist the commission in painting an inaccurate picture of fraud. Some states, including Kobachs Kansas, have said they are legally prohibited from providing the commission with some of the sensitive information requested, such as the last four digits of voters Social Security numbers. Kristen Clarke, the president of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, immediately seized on Trumps tweet to urge states not to comply with the commissions work, which she called a sham. Earlier this week, voting advocacy groups raised alarm after Trump appointed Hans von Spakovsky, a former Justice Department lawyer, to the commission. Von Spakovsky has long suggested widespread fraud is a problem and advocated more restrictive voting measures. Trumps Saturday tweet was the latest example of the president undermining the work of the White House on Twitter. After White House press secretary Sean Spicer insisted Trumps executive order on immigration didnt constitute a travel ban earlier this year, Trump called it a travel ban in a tweet. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit cited Trumps tweet in a June ruling saying the ban was unconstitutional.",0,42.85,14.3,16,423,15,"Trump Just Undermined The Work Of His Own 'Election Integrity' Probe",2017-07-01 13:09:00,"Sam Levine","Politics","@amazonecho,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_ga,donald-trump,elections,fraud,political-science,republican-politics,type: news,us-news",275464,245686,275464,324262,32483,197714,1.086,1.139,1.186,1.471,121649,115323,38492,5737,222464,8125,9410,12967,10774,1999,1,9,4354,4182,150,4,18,"Trump Just Undermined The Work Of His Own 'Election Integrity' Probe",2017-07-01 13:09:00,"Sam Levine","Politics","@amazonecho,@health_ibs,@health_models,@team_us_news_ga,donald-trump,elections,fraud,political-science,republican-politics,type: news,us-news",275464,245686,275464,324262,32483,197714,1.086,1.139,1.186,1.471,121649,115323,38492,5737,222464,8125,9410,12967,10774,1999,1,9,4354,4182,150,4,18

The study, conducted by economics professor Analisa Packham (now at Miami University), shows that in the first three years after Texas Republicans slashed the family planning budget in 2011 and shut down more than 80 womens health clinics , the abortion rate among teenagers in the state rose 3 percent over what it would have been had the clinics remained open.After cutting Planned Parenthood out of the states subsidized womens health program, then-Gov.Rick Perry (R) said his goal was to ensure abortions are as rare as possible under existing law . But the move actually interfered with an overall downward trend in abortions in Texas. This certainly isnt the way to have fewer abortions, said Dr. Diane Horvath-Cosper, an OB-GYN in Maryland and an advocate with Physicians for Reproductive Health. The abortion rates nationally have decreased and are at a historic low. So for Texans to see an increase in adolescent abortions is really telling <U+2015> it seemed to have followed the national trend until these clinics were defunded. The greatest rises in abortion rates occurred in rural areas, where access to affordable family planning care was already scarce.In Gregg County, where the local health center lost 60 percent of its family planning funding, the abortion rate increased by 191 percent between 2012 and 2014 . The Austin American-Statesman reported that at least five counties in East Texas also saw considerable increases in abortions over that two-year period. The overall abortion rate in the state dropped 14 percent between 2013 and 2016 <U+2015> but this was largely because in some low-income rural areas, like the Rio Grande Valley, women would have had to drive over 100 miles to find the nearest safe and legal abortion provider. Those women either had to seek out unsafe, do-it-yourself procedures or simply have babies they didnt want or couldnt afford. President Donald Trump and the Republicans in control of Congress now want to defund Planned Parenthood nationwide by preventing Medicaid recipients <U+2015> who account for more than half of Planned Parenthoods patients <U+2015> from going there for birth control and cancer screenings. The Congressional Budget Office estimates this would cause 15 percent of women in rural areas to lose access to family planning care entirely, which in turn would lead to more unplanned pregnancies and likely more abortions. Studies show that 40 percent of unintended pregnancies end in abortion, so cutting access to birth control is not the way to reduce the overall abortion rate. Only a few moderate Republicans, like Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), seem to understand the flaw in this plan. If youre serious about trying to reduce the number of abortions , Collins told reporters in March , the best way to do that is to make family planning more widely available.

Many states flatly said they would not comply with the administrations request for sensitive voter information, including birth dates, Social Security numbers, drivers license numbers, and email addresses. Other states , however, said they were willing to do the bare minimum to comply with the request by only providing voter information that was already available to the public. In every state listed below, however,election officials from both parties are putting up some form of resistance to the Trump administrations demands for voter information. Some are pushing back against the commission despite the fact that they have yet to receive its actual letter requesting the information.

All year long, outlets parachuted reporters into Trump Country to observe his voters in their habitat Cletus safari is the derisive term of art  and the reporters returned with tenderly crafted soft-focus portrait after tenderly crafted soft-focus portrait of people aching to say the n-word. Trump supporters are mad, reporters told us. Maybe youve heard? Theyre mad at the establishment, theyre mad at Democrats, and most of all, theyre mad that theyve been left behind. (And of course a lot of them are mad at black people, and many even say as much, but we try not to talk about that part.) These stories were a sort of pornography. They existed less as a way of explaining the country to their audience than as a way for media outlets to gratify themselves, or perhaps to atone for the perceived sin of overlooking Trump supporters the year before. Some profiles offered insight; many more did not. But together, in their sheer bulk, they illuminated a larger story: the longstanding media habit of indexing the American political narrative to the sanctified yearnings of a narrow slice of white voter. Reagan Democrats, independent voters, the undecided,soft Republicans  no matter how small their number, no matter how wide the electoral margin,these groups always become the axis on which the story of every election turns. In 2017, the story was deemed to be the rural Trump diehard and his or her unflagging support for the president.

299,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/j20-inauguration-rioting-felony-charges-journalist-alexei-wood_us_5a0cb991e4b0c0b2f2f78aed","Editors note: Taking a cue from Slate , this article describes an American news story  the virtually unprecedented prosecution of nearly 200 protesters on felony charges  using language the American media typically reserves for news stories written about more repressive countries. Felony charges against American journalists are jarring. Our approach to this story is meant to be as well. WASHINGTON  An American photojournalist swept up in a mass arrest of hundreds of demonstrators conducted by security forces in the nations capital earlier this year during a protest of a regime change ceremony will face a criminal trial here Monday. Alexei Wood, a 37-year-old freelance photojournalist based in the American southwest, has been charged with multiple felonies. If found guilty, he could face decades inside a mammoth prison system in the worlds most incarcerated nation. Wood was one of more than 200 citizens captured en masse by police forces quelling demonstrations held at the same time as President Donald Trumps inauguration. Just weeks before, the tough-talking real estate magnate and reality television star shocked the nations political class when his rightward, populist campaign beat out that of a candidate from Americas predominant center-left political dynasty. The continued prosecution of Wood and nearly 200 protesters has raised alarm among many who worry it will have a chilling effect on dissent in America, a country that holds itself up as a beacon of free speech and political expression. Trumps inauguration here on Jan. 20 sparked mass protest, much of which was peaceful.But police forces quickly moved in when members of a loosely organized far-left rebel group dressed in black smashed business windows in the capitals downtown. Later that day, some set fire to a limousine, which they viewed as a symbol of the countrys elites. The unrest resulted in more than $100,000 of property damage, and several members of the security force sustained minor injuries. The protests have been referred to as the J20<U+2033> protests, short for the date. The demonstrations were organized by a group called DisruptJ20, whose website had been subject to search warrants that critics called a fishing expedition. In recent years, security forces in Washington, also known as the District of Columbia, have generally exercised restraint in their response to demonstrations, which are more common here in the nations capital than in most parts of this vast country of more than 300 million people. But once property damage began on the day of Trumps installment, the Metropolitan Police Department responded to the demonstrations with significant force. They threw stinger grenades, fired pepper balls and sprayed chemical agents that are banned in warfare . Following the lead of police, prosecutors also responded aggressively, moving to charge protesters using a rarely invoked riot act, which holds members of an entire group responsible for the actions of a few. Wood is now among nearly 200 defendants who, if convicted on charges of rioting, conspiracy to riot, inciting others to riot, and multiple acts of property destruction, could potentially each be sentenced to over 60 years in prison. Though such extreme sentences are unlikely, human rights observers point to the aggressive prosecution of those rounded up during the demonstration as yet another excess of the American criminal justice system, which has come under increased scrutiny in recent years especially in regard to its treatment of ethnic minorities. Wood and five co-defendants will be the first of those arrested during the protests to go on trial, with the remainder of the cases scheduled in the coming months. The trials will pit two groups routinely demonized by Trump <U+2015> journalists and protesters <U+2015> against security forces the American law and order president has sought to embolden both through his rhetoric and through official government policy . Over the past year, prosecutors cracked into at least eight of the cellphones confiscated from defendants, extracting some of their internet histories, communications and pictures to be used as evidence in court. In April, security forces with judicial branch approval broke into the D.C. home of one protest organizer <U+2015> a tactic more commonly associated with investigations of drug rings and criminal enterprises <U+2015> seizing thousands of dollars worth of personal property, including computers, cellphones and art supplies. Media advocates and civil rights groups are particularly alarmed by the continued pursuit of severe felony charges against Wood, an eccentric photographer and videographer who has described his beat as resistance cultures and conflicts and has covered political unrest and sectarian violence across the country. Prosecutors had dropped charges against seven other journalists arrested that day, most of whom had connections to established media outlets. But the charges against two freelance journalists, Wood and Aaron Cant , remain. Wood livestreamed his experience on Facebook, a 13-year-old social media network which initially catered to college students and now has a great influence over the countrys political discourse. Woods video will likely play a prominent role in the case against him and other protesters, and may offer some insight as to why prosecutors continued pursuing charges against him and not other journalists. In the video, Wood appears to express support for those engaged in destruction. In one part, Wood shouts wooo as someone tries to smash the window of a bar called Maddys Taproom. At another point, Wood appears to celebrate as a masked individual spray-paints revolution or death on a garage door. Weve got some gra-fee-taaay, he says, adding an approving wooo as the spray painter finishes. Such expression, especially in support of property destruction, is widely considered unacceptable by the standards of American journalism, which typically encourages avoiding direct advocacy for political causes, and would be grounds for dismissal at most of the nations mainstream outlets. But constitutional rights arent exclusively for journalists in this 241-year-old democracy, and press advocates like the Committee To Protect Journalists say Woods political utterances during his documentation of the event should not result in any charges, let alone severe felonies. The countrys constitutional protections, in theory at least, are supposed to protect the right to peacefully assemble and express oneself in a country that holds itself up as a bastion of freedom. In interviews with HuffPost outside the aging, fortified courthouse, not far from the U.S. Capitol, Wood acknowledged his behavior that day might not sit well with other journalists, adding that he did nothing illegal. My professionalism is certainly up to be criticized, and Im open to it and Im welcoming of it, he said. But I absolutely stand by that I did nothing illegal and I did nothing wrong. He says he was there as a journalist and had been hoping to sell his photos. I went there to document, he said. The United States generally has a better track record on press freedom than most other countries. But arrests of journalists across the nation have seemingly been more common in recent years, with the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker logging 31 arrests of journalists in 2017 alone. Just over three years ago, for example, one of the authors of this story was arrested by local police inside one of the countrys ubiquitous McDonalds restaurants in the American Midwest, where hed been covering demonstrations that broke out after a police officer shot and killed an 18-year-old ethnic minority. The demonstrators were protesting the suburban security force accused of rampant discrimination and corruption. Law enforcement isnt the only threat, as journalists have also been targeted and subject to harassment at political rallies and demonstrations. Earlier this year, a politician from the American West body-slammed a reporter from The Guardian, shattering his glasses. Voters elected him anyway. Trump has been particularly vocal in his condemnation of journalists, calling them enemies of the American people. His top law enforcement official, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a conservative from the American South, has declined to rule out jailing journalists and greatly expanded the number of federal investigations into leaks to the news media. Earlier this year, prosecutors even secured the conviction of a woman who laughed during Sessions appearance before the countrys legislative branch, though authorities declined to put her on trial yet again when a member of the judicial branch tossed out the conviction based on the governments misconduct. Trumps response to protests has skewed authoritarian over the past two years. As a presidential candidate, he routinely called on his supporters to engage in violence against anybody disrupting his rallies. But after a resurgent neo-Nazi and white supremacist movement held a pro-Trump rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August, which culminated in a neo-Nazi driving his car through a crowd of counterprotesters, killing one woman, Trump was slow to condemn his supporters, eventually blaming the violence there on both sides. Woods trial Monday will be held before District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Lynn Leibovitz, who was appointed by the second president in the conservative Bush political dynasty, factions of which have tried to distance themselves from the current de facto leader of the Republican Party, Trump. Leibovitz, a former homicide prosecutor during the 1990s when Washington was known as the nations murder capital, is a widely respected official some consider  D.C.s toughest judge . She once sentenced a 79-year-old demonstrator whod been arrested multiple times to 25 days in jail, and she thus far has denied defense motions to dismiss cases against the defendants who argued the capital citys rioting laws were too broadly written. Wood and his co-defendants appeared before Leibovitz in court last week, watching over the course of two days as members of the jury panel of D.C. residents came in to tell the judge and attorneys a bit about themselves. The trial is likely to stretch out over the course of four weeks. Quick in this case is going to be a relative term, Leibovitz said in court last week. The case is being prosecuted by the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, which is part of the executive branchs Justice Department. In the nations capital, the U.S. attorney plays a unique role in that the office prosecutes both federal crimes and local crimes, which means prosecutorial decisions are made by an appointee of the countrys ruling party rather than a prosecutor chosen by local voters. The vast majority of this rapidly gentrifying citys residents, many of whom are employed within the American bureaucracy, oppose the countrys ruling party. Several were removed from the jury due to their close connections to the government and law enforcement agencies <U+2015> one potential juror, for example, was quickly dismissed because her nephew was a D.C. police officer and was injured during the protest. Even if jurors dont convict Woods on any charges, the journalist said the prosecution has already taken a serious toll on him. Getting arrested was traumatic. The pepper spray was traumatic. Honestly the whole experience was traumatic, he said. The machinery and the inhumanity of pretty much every single bit of it. Wood, who lives over 1,600 miles away in San Antonio, Texas, said hes already had to attend numerous pre-trial hearings, and had to either fly or drive the distance each time. This security forces response to the Jan. 20 protests is currently being investigated by local authorities in Washington. The heavily armed police that day never warned protesters they could face arrest if they didnt disperse, as is required by the departments own policies. Instead, they surrounded the protesters, an aggressive policing technique known as kettling, often used at protests over the police killings of unarmed African-Americans. A recent kettling incident in the Midwest city of St. Louis swept up several journalists, and a member of the judicial branch found that the aggressive security force tactics there had likely violated the bedrock principles of American democracy. In Washington, protesters were trapped and deprived of food, water and bathroom access for hours before eventually being detained and arrested. The zip ties used to bind their wrists dug into their flesh, causing them to bleed. And for weeks after, some said their skin peeled from the pepper spray with which security forces had sprayed them. Journalist Shay Horse alleged in a lawsuit here that he and four protesters were subjected to cavity searches during their detention that could be considered sexual assault. The five men were forced to take off their pants, Horse said. An officer then grabbed the testicles of the five men, Horse alleges, before sticking a finger in each of their rectums, as other officers laughed. Horse said in a press conference earlier this year that it felt like police were using molestation and rape as punishment. Although the city has since launched an independent investigation into how the protest was policed, few of the defendants have hope for real accountability. The organization hired by the city to conduct the investigation is a decidedly pro-police organization called the Police Foundation. Still, a dissident named Kris Hermes told HuffPost, If the investigation proves that people were unfairly arrested, what does that mean for people that have already been tried? Hermes is a longtime legal activist affiliated with the National Lawyers Guild, which has been working with the defendants in this case. Hes worried the charges against the defendants in this case are part of a government effort to crack down on protests. I think its already sent a chilling message, Hermes said. If all its gonna take is people going on the streets and being near some property destruction or near people engaged in alleged criminal activity for them all to get felony charges, thats going to stifle free expression in the streets, and prevent people coming out and protesting when they have every right to do so.

300,"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-daca-bannon-breitbart_us_59af0836e4b0354e440d62a3","WASHINGTON <U+2015> Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is still notching policy wins after his return to the right-wing website Breitbart. President Donald Trumps decision to end Obama-era protections for undocumented immigrants brought as children to the U.S. by their parents is a major victory for Bannon and Breitbart  and they know it. As Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced plans Tuesday to terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program with a six-month delay on enforcement, Breitbarts chief White House correspondent celebrated: This is a huge step in the right direction for the Trump administration, and for Breitbart as we cover the stories that most of the rest of the media ignore on immigration like crimes committed by illegal aliens including so-called Dreamers, the economic and cultural effects on American workers of large scale legal and illegal immigration, and the forgotten man and woman President Trump honed in on during the 2016 race and in his inauguration speech, a senior Breitbart editor who was not authorized to speak on the record told HuffPost. Breitbart was a primary source of the push to repeal DACA, which covers approximately 800,000 people. The site has sometimes published multiple stories per day promoting repeal and praising DACA opponents , while attacking Democrats and Republicans who support the program. At one point on Tuesday, nine of the sites 10 most popular stories were about Trumps DACA repeal (or, in one case, about Hillary Clintons DACA support ). Its no surprise that Breitbart sees a victory here: The site has served for years as the most prominent platform for anti-immigration organizations and politicians to promote their views. Breitbarts celebration also shows that the right-wing populist movement Bannon represents is still influential in the administration, even after Bannons departure . Strong supporters of these policies remain in power: Sessions, who Bannon convinced to endorse Trump in 2016 , remains in charge of the Justice Department. Stephen Miller, a former Sessions aide, is the presidents top domestic policy adviser. And former Breitbart writer Julia Hahn remains in the White House working on policy with Miller. Bannon can now provide them support from his perch at Breitbart. Trumps decision on DACA could result in a congressional push to pass legislation reinstating the program. But Breitbart is already planning to work to defeat any such legislative action, should it arise. Over the next six months as Congress considers whether to legislatively grant amnesty to the 800,000 plus illegal aliens that Obama illegally granted DACA executive amnesty to, we will be vigilant in how we cover and expose any career politicians who run counter to the will of the American voting public and the citizens of this country who very clearly stated in November 2016 that amnesty in any form is not acceptable public policy, the senior Breitbart editor told HuffPost. The idea of a fight against congressional Republicans who favor immigration reforms that would legalize undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. dovetails with Breitbarts larger political mission of remaking the Republican Party. The news organization, particularly under Bannon, is openly hostile to both House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). In 2013, Bannon, Sessions and Miller, then a staffer for Sessions, successfully joined forces to beat a bipartisan immigration reform bill. Bannon and Miller teamed up again in 2014 to orchestrate the shock defeat of then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.). Cantors support for immigration reform, and the backing he received from Wall Street donors who supported the policy, were the main issues that brought him down. Breitbart now backs former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore in the special Republican Senate primary runoff election against Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.), who was appointed to fill the seat Sessions left when he became attorney general. This position puts the site at odds with Bannons former boss, Trump, who endorsed the incumbent Strange in early August. Just as it did in Cantors race, the website has dispatched reporter Matt Boyle to cover the final weeks of the contest. One such dispatch favorably compares Moore to Sessions , noting that their respective positions on immigration and trade are no different. The Moore-Strange primary fight is only a piece of the larger battle Breitbart is waging. The big fight is to oust Ryan from his position as House speaker and replace him with a congressman more favorable to the Breitbart agenda. Axios reported on Tuesday that Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who heads the conservative House Freedom Caucus, met with Bannon and Boyle at Breitbarts offices in Washington on Monday to discuss the caucus plans to take control of House leadership. Meadows appeared the next day as a guest on Breitbarts radio show , hosted by Boyle, to tell listeners how they should pressure Ryan, House Republican leadership and their own representatives. Meadows laid out the big fights to come on the debt ceiling and the budget, and urged Breitbart followers to press their lawmakers to oppose linking a debt ceiling increase to Hurricane Harvey relief funds. He called on listeners to tell lawmakers only to pass a government funding bill that would defund sanctuary cities and Planned Parenthood and include money for Trumps border wall, and to put a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare on the presidents desk. If they do that, we will hopefully avoid this bloody September, Meadows concluded.
