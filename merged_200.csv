The accident occurred on the fair’s opening day at 7:19 p.m. local time at the Ohio Expo Center grounds on the Fire Ball ride, Scripps News reported. Battalion Chief Steve Martin of the Columbus Fire Division told the Record-Courier that some victims had been thrown from the ride during the accident. Tyler Jarrell , an 18-year-old passenger who was on the Fire Ball at the time, landed 50 feet from the ride and died on impact . Jarrell’s girlfriend, Keziah Lewis, 19, was also a passenger and was severely injured during the accident. As seen in a bystander’s video, a part of the mechanical ride came loose as the fast-moving ride swung, sending a carriage of passengers flying into the air. The other victims injured Wednesday included three men and two women, as well as a 14-year-old boy, the Columbus Dispatch reported. At least two of the injured remained hospitalized Thursday in critical condition, according to The Associated Press. Ohio Gov. John Kasich called it “the worst tragedy in the history of the fair,” adding, “it’s a very, very sad night for all of us.” The governor ordered all rides at the fair shut down until each one could be inspected. Warning: The video below is graphic. David Evans, medical director of the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, where three victims were taken, told CBS News that bystander videos of the incident helped medical staff to better understand the injuries. The victims, Evans said, appeared to have been ejected at a high rate of speed from 30 feet in the air. “Having that video really showed us that this was a great force and a great mechanism, really consistent with a high-speed motor vehicle crash with an ejection, really something more along those lines,” Evans explained to CNN . At a news conference Wednesday night, Kasich announced that the fair will be open Thursday but all the rides would remain closed. The governor added that he would be at the fairgrounds Thursday to speak with people who were affected by the accident. Organizers of the Ohio State Fair confirmed reports of a “ride incident” and said they have launched an investigation. The governor’s office, along with the state highway patrol and the Ohio Department of Agriculture will also be investigating the fatal accident , the Dayton Daily News reported. The Fire Ball, also known as the Afterburner, is a mechanical ride that swings and spins passengers back and forth, according to Amusements of America , the carnival company in charge of the fair’s rides . The Fire Ball can swing passengers 40 feet above the midway while spinning at 13 revolutions per minute. Amusements of America is a New Jersey-based traveling carnival company with a route that stretches from Miami to New York and to Ohio, Tennessee and the Carolinas. The company has held the Guinness World Record for the largest traveling carnival in the U.S. KMG, the Dutch company that manufactured the Fire Ball ride, said in a statement to HuffPost that the accident involved a “passenger carrying gondola” that “detached from the supporting sweep arm.” There are 43 rides in the world that are the same model as the Fire Ball, including 11 that are in the U.S. KMG project leader Albert Kroon told Dutch National broadcaster NOS that KMG staffers were on the phone with rescuers on Wednesday helping to free passengers who were still stuck in their seats after the accident, according to the AP. Kroon said this is the first time a serious accident has happened with a KMG machine, according to the English-language Dutch news site the Netherland Times English. In a statement sent to HuffPost on Thursday, KMG called for fairs around the world to cease operating the ride immediately as they investigate: “Our deepest sympathies go out to all who were involved or affected by this tragic accident. We are currently gathering information on the accident and investigating the cause and circumstances of the accident. Until further details are known, operators of Fireball/Afterburner (FRB24) and Move-it (MVT24/MVT32) type amusement rides are instructed to cease operation of the ride until further notice.” Before the fair opened Wednesday, amusement ride inspectors from the Ohio Department of Agriculture told the Record-Courier that they worked long hours this week to complete safety inspections on the 72 rides after rain and flash flooding caused delays. State inspectors are responsible for making sure that each ride is constructed properly and for checking the ride’s safety systems and restraint mechanisms before, during and after the ride is set up, according to the newspaper. Michael Vartorella, the Ohio State Fair’s chief ride inspector, said he and a four-person crew inspected and signed off on the Fire Ball on Wednesday , according to the Dayton Daily News. Amusement ride owners are required to have insurance of no less than $500,000 in the event of an accident in which at least one person is injured or killed and at least $1 million coverage for incidents involving more than one person, according to the agricultural department’s Amusement Ride Safety Division . Kasich and several other local lawmakers, including Sens. Rob Portman (R) and Sherrod Brown (D), issued statements on the tragic incident. “I am terribly saddened by this accident, by the loss of life and that people were injured enjoying Ohio’s fair,” Kasich tweeted shortly after the incident. “Our thoughts and prayers go out to those grieving and injured. I have ordered a full investigation into this incident and have ordered that all fair rides be shut down until additional safety inspections can be completed.” The fair is scheduled to run until Aug. 7. This article has been updated throughout with information on the victims, responses and other details.

But some onlookers apparently thought this one, of Prince Harry and Melania Trump at the Invictus Games in Toronto over the weekend, is worth 666 . Harry and the first lady posed for a series of photos together before sitting down for a chat. Trump stood with her arms at her sides, while Harry’s hand was half-tucked into his jacket in a very unusual way: His ring and middle fingers were tucked inside his coat along with his thumb, while he held his pinky and pointer fingers outside. His unusual gesture ― and whether or not it was intentional ― became a hot topic over the weekend, even eclipsing Harry’s first official appearance with his American girlfriend Meghan Markle. People on Twitter and some media outlets noted it looks like Harry was giving a symbol of the devil, either signaling that he himself is the devil or that the spirit of the devil surrounded him . But two body language experts think the gesture was misread in two very different ways. Patti Wood , body language expert and author of Snap: Making the Most of First Impressions, Body Language & Charisma , told HuffPost that while Harry has held his jacket in photos before, this specific hand position is new. “This is called the horn or the devil’s horn, and what people are saying in the media about it is not correct,” she said. “It is not a sign that he’s the devil, but rather a warning off of evil spirits. It’s a protective gesture against evil or darkness and illness.” Huh. Wood said putting one’s hand on one’s stomach is an act of self-comfort, and she has previously noticed other world leaders exhibiting self-comfort in photo ops with President Donald Trump. “I’ve seen world leaders in photo shoots with Trump and I see a lot of what are called self-comfort cues,” she said. “This would be considered one of those. It looks like the devil’s horn but it is also hand to belly,” she said. “At the very least it would be a comfort cue, and show a lot of tension and a need to protect his central core.” Joe Navarro , body language expert and author of What Every Body is Saying: An Ex-FBI Agent’s Guide to Speed-Reading People , is skeptical of reading any intention in Harry’s body language. He pointed out to HuffPost that a photo is a moment in time, and a number of factors could have led to this particular positioning. “Had the photographers loitered too long? Is there something else going on?” he asked, adding, “I have to wonder, was he going to unbutton his jacket and then changed his mind? Was he in prep for sitting and then they asked him to stand again to do more photos? To me, you can’t draw too many inferences from the photo. I wouldn’t personally read too much into that.” But both experts agree that there is a level of tension visible in Harry, and both pointed out the prince usually looks much more relaxed and happy in such situations. “There was some psychological discomfort,” Navarro said. “The look of his face, the look of his hand is very unusual, except for the fact that he and his brother have a tendency to cover their belly which is a self-soothing behavior to deal with a bit of tension.” “His normal facial expression is actually typically a smile, which is wonderful and warm and engaging,” Wood said. “Here, the mouth is more closed, lips more pulled back and he’s not smiling.” Wood also noted that Melania Trump, who kept her arms pressed closely to her body the whole time (“a fear response”), looked tense, too. “If you look at their smiles, hers has enormous amount of tension. Her look is slitted eyes, closed eyes, which we do in tension. We also close our eyes when we want to attack.” Still, Navarro was firm that when it comes to Harry, we can’t draw conclusions from a weird-looking hand position. “All we can say is that it is unusual, but we can’t automatically say he intended it to be this or that,” he said. That didn’t stop Twitter users from saying it. They flooded the site with responses to the awkward photos, with many suggesting Harry was sending a subliminal message. Is the devil in the details? Unless Harry ever address his strange stance, we may never know.",69.11,8.3,10,740,740,"looks

Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) asked a panel of Trump’s judicial nominees to indicate if they had never tried a case to verdict in a courtroom. Matthew Spencer Petersen, a nominee for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, raised his hand. Kennedy proceeded to press him on legal matters. KENNEDY: Have you ever tried a jury trial? PETERSEN: I have not. KENNEDY: Civil? PETERSEN: No. KENNEDY: Criminal? PETERSEN: No. KENNEDY: Bench? PETERSEN: No. KENNEDY: State or federal court? PETERSEN: I have not. It only got worse from there. Petersen, who is currently the chairman of the U.S. Federal Election Commission, struggled to answer more questions as it became clear he did not have the experience typically expected of a federal judge. KENNEDY: As a trial judge, you’re obviously going to have witnesses. Can you tell me what the Daubert standard is? PETERSEN: Sen. Kennedy, I don’t have that readily at my disposal but I would be happy to take a closer look at that. That is not something I’ve had to contend with. KENNEDY: Do you know what a motion in limine is? PETERSEN: Yes.. I haven’t, I’m, again, my background is not in litigation as when I was replying to Chairman (Chuck) Grassley (R-Iowa), I haven’t had to um, again, do a deep dive. Petersen then began ticking off his experience “in a decision-making role” at the FEC. Kennedy interrupted him: KENNEDY: Yes, I’ve read your resume. Just for the record, do you know what a motion in limine is? PETERSEN: I would probably not be able to give you a good definition right here at the table. KENNEDY: Do you know what the Younger abstention doctrine is? PETERSEN: Um, I’ve heard of it... but I, again. KENNEDY: How about the Pullman abstention doctrine ? PETERSEN: I... I heard... KENNEDY: Y’all see that a lot in federal court. A number of Trump’s judicial nominees have come under fire for not being fit to serve on the federal bench. Four of his court picks have been rated “not qualified” by the American Bar Association ― an embarrassingly high number to receive the abysmal rating in a president’s first year. One of them, district court court nominee Brett Talley, withdrew his nomination this week. Part of the reason this keeps happening is that Trump is nominating judges at a breakneck pace without taking the time to thoroughly vet their backgrounds.

Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) asked a panel of Trump’s judicial nominees to indicate if they had never tried a case to verdict in a courtroom.
Matthew Spencer Petersen, a nominee for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, raised his hand.
PETERSEN: No. KENNEDY: State or federal court?
Petersen, who is currently the chairman of the U.S. Federal Election Commission, struggled to answer more questions as it became clear he did not have the experience typically expected of a federal judge.

KENNEDY: Do you know what the Younger abstention doctrine is?
PETERSEN: Um, I’ve heard of it...
KENNEDY: Y’all see that a lot in federal court.

The picture, snapped by a White House photographer traveling with the president as he left his golf course in Sterling, Va., went viral almost immediately. News outlets picked up the story when it appeared in a White House pool report. Late-night talk show hosts told jokes about the encounter and people on social media began hailing the unidentified woman as a “she-ro,” using the hashtag #Her2020 . The woman’s name is Juli Briskman. Her employer, government contractor Akima LLC, wasn’t so happy about the photo. They fired her over it. In a Saturday interview with HuffPost, Briskman, a 50-year-old mother of two, said she was stunned that someone had taken a picture of her giving Trump the middle finger. As the photo circulated online, Briskman decided to tell Akima’s HR department what was happening when she went to work on Monday. By Tuesday, her bosses called her into a meeting and said she had violated the company’s social media policy by using the photo as her profile picture on Twitter and Facebook. “They said, ‘We’re separating from you,‘” said Briskman. “Basically, you cannot have ‘lewd’ or ‘obscene’ things in your social media. So they were calling flipping him off ‘obscene.’” Briskman, who worked in marketing and communications at Akima for just over six months, said she emphasized to the executives that she wasn’t on the job when the incident happened and that her social media pages don’t mention her employer. They told her that because Akima was a government contractor, the photo could hurt their business, she said. Virginia is an employment-at-will state, meaning employers can fire people anytime and for any reason. But Briskman said what’s been particularly infuriating is that a male colleague kept his job after recently posting lewd comments on his Facebook page that featured Akima LLC as his cover photo. She said this colleague was reprimanded for calling someone “a fucking Libtard asshole” on Facebook, but was allowed to delete the post and keep his job. “How is that any less ‘obscene’ than me flipping off the president?” she asked. “How is that fair?” Akima did not respond to requests for comment via email and phone. Asked what she was thinking when she saw Trump’s motorcade roll up next to her, Briskman said it was a gut reaction to flip him off. “He was passing by and my blood just started to boil,” she said. “I’m thinking, DACA recipients are getting kicked out. He pulled ads for open enrollment in Obamacare. Only one-third of Puerto Rico has power. I’m thinking, he’s at the damn golf course again.” “I flipped off the motorcade a number of times,” she added. Briskman, a Democrat, said she plans to look for a new job with an advocacy group that she believes in, like Planned Parenthood or PETA. Despite getting fired, she said she has no regrets about the attention her public show of displeasure with Trump received. In fact, she said she’s happy to be an image of protest that resonates with many Americans. “In some ways, I’m doing better than ever,” she said. “I’m angry about where our country is right now. I am appalled. This was an opportunity for me to say something.” UPDATE: 11:54 a.m. Monday ― Akima’s website went down later Monday . Here’s a screenshot . UPDATE: 11:41 a.m. Tuesday ― Briskman’s friends have started a GoFundMe campaign to help her raise money while she looks for a new job.",73.68,6.6,9.3,609,609,"briskman

She only needed 15: “I think that the white supremacist issue, it was very obvious that it was a terrorist attack. And I think that President Donald Trump should’ve made a statement earlier addressing the fact, and in making sure all Americans feel safe in this country. That is the number one issue right now.” Wood’s comments were in line with other statements she’s made. As Miss Texas, she called her platform “ You Belong ” and spoke out against bullying and for equality and inclusion. “It’s important for everyone to hear the phrase because they do ― everybody belongs ,” Wood told Out Smart, a Houston-based magazine for the LGBTQ community.

In the process, she gave many Twitter users a chance to engage in what they do best: get good and snarky. Trump’s tweets may have been truly sincere, but many people thought she had a motive behind her posts. Other people pointed out that Harry already has a close friendship with another American political family. One person noted that it may not be anything personal, just simply that Harry’s family has little in common with the Trumps. To be honest, Harry may have antipathy for the Trumps that goes back to 2000, when Donald Trump told Howard Stern in a radio interview that he would have slept with Princess Diana as long as she had an HIV test first. Markle has historically had more of a mixed reaction toward the first family. In 2014, she wrote on her blog The Tig that Ivanka Trump was “staggeringly beautiful, no question, but so incredibly savvy and intelligent.” However, during a May 2016 appearance on Comedy Central’s “The Nightly Show,” Markle said she thought Donald Trump was misogynistic and that she might consider permanently moving to Canada should he be elected. A spokesperson for the royal family declined to comment to People on whether any Trumps would get a wedding invite. If they don’t, it might not be entirely personal. Newsweek points out that security concerns were a reason Obamas weren’t invited to Prince William and Kate Middleton’s 2011 ceremony. However, considering the former president’s friendship with Harry, perhaps he’ll be on the invitation list for the May wedding.

Police could not immediately determine a motive for the attack. LAS VEGAS ― At least 58 people were killed, plus the gunman, and more than 500 wounded after a gunman unleashed a storm of bullets on an outdoor country music concert in Las Vegas late Sunday. It was the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Singer Jason Aldean was performing in the final act of the Route 91 Harvest Festival, a massive three-day country music event, when his set was interrupted by rapid gunfire around 10 p.m. Stephen Craig Paddock , 64, was shooting at the approximately 22,000 concertgoers from a room on the 32nd floor of the nearby Mandalay Bay Hotel, police later said. Hordes of panicked fans rushed to flee the scene, hiding under cars and bleachers to escape the bombardment. SWAT team members stormed the hotel and found Paddock in his room, dead of apparent self-inflicted wound and surrounded by at least 20 firearms , including “long rifles,” police said. The windows of his room were smashed open. Police later found 18 additional firearms, “some” explosives and several thousand rounds of ammunition at Paddock’s home in Mesquite, Nevada. Victims, including some in critical condition, were taken to five nearby hospitals. Police said they expected the death count to rise in the coming hours and days. The Mandalay Bay casino was largely empty Monday afternoon with a heavy security presence throughout the casino floor. Guards blocked exists to the famed Las Vegas Strip. The tense feeling hovering over the main casino floor was offset by friendly staff ready for gamblers to resume their usual activities. The main casino floor bars, still at low capacity but busier than all other areas of the casino floor, were serving the guests who remained. Occasional applause and cheering trickled out of the casino floor, celebrations of those still gambling. Some staff said the lack of guests in the casino was normal for a Monday afternoon, but others said they saw an unusual number of guests with luggage checking out. Some nearby shops were closed; others remained open for business as usual. Officials are still investigating the motive behind the attack. Paddock, a white male who was described as the “sole aggressor,” had no serious criminal record, police said. He lived in a retirement community in Mesquite, Nevada, with a female companion, Marilou Danley , but he had been staying in the Mandalay hotel room since Sept 28. Authorities said that Danley, 62, was not a suspect. Eric Paddock, the suspect’s brother, said Stephen Paddock was a retired accountant with “no religious affiliation, no political affiliation,” and no history of mental illness. Family and friends described the suspect an an avid gambler. “We are completely dumbfounded,” Eric Paddock told the Orlando Sentinel. “We can’t understand what happened.” The owner of the gun shop that recently sold Paddock a shotgun offered a similar assessment. “He didn’t set off any of my alarms, anything than I felt like there’s a problem in any way shape or form with him,” he told an ABC affiliate . “He was a normal, everyday guy.” ISIS on Monday claimed responsibility for the attack through its Amaq News site, but an FBI spokesman said that authorities had found “no connection to an international terrorist group.” “We don’t understand what’s happened... but as we move on we’ll learn more” Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval (R) said Monday at a press conference. “It was a cowardly despicable act that I am very angry about. There is not much we can do but learn.” Witnesses to Sunday’s attack described frantic concertgoers running for their lives as intermittent rounds of bullets rained down on the crowd. Many thought the pops were coming from fireworks. “The concert was going on and we heard what sounded firecrackers going off,” witness Megan Kearny told NBC News . “All of a sudden we heard what sounded like a machine gun and people just started screaming that they were hit and to get down, and about every 20 seconds after that you would hear a round of machine guns, and people just dropping, hundreds of bodies over the ground.” Joseph Ostunio told the Las Vegas Review Journal that he and his friends “heard shots ring out and we thought they were fireworks so we stayed. And then all of a sudden they just kept coming and coming.” Ostunio said he realized something was wrong after Aldean abruptly left the stage. Justin Leyva, a 22-year-old graphic designer from Riverside, California, was at the concert with his girlfriend, Jenna Newton, and her family when he heard the initial gunfire. “I look back to my girlfriends father who just yells to get down ― and we did,” Leyva said. “My instinct kicked in and I knew I had to get myself as far away from the firing as possible. I grabbed my girlfriend as she was staying down for cover and began throwing chairs out of our path until we finally decided to make a break for it.” Aldean and his crew were unharmed, he said in an Instagram post, calling the incident “beyond horrific.” One off-duty police officer was killed and multiple others were injured, including one from the Bakersfield Police Department in Bakersfield, California, authorities said. The Bakersfield officer’s injuries were not life-threatening. Police said that two on-duty police officers were also injured in the shooting, one critically. President Donald Trump called the shooting an “act of pure evil” and said he would travel to Las Vegas on Wednesday. “This was a day I wish I had never had to see here in my 27 years of law enforcement,” Las Vegas Police Department Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said. “Seeing that scene was probably the most disturbing thing I have had to see in those 27 years.” The shooting was the third attack on a major music event in recent years. Earlier this year, 22 people were killed at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester in the United Kingdom. And 90 people died in 2015 during a suicide attack at a performance by the Eagles of Death Metal at the Bataclan theatre in Paris. Authorities shut down parts of the Las Vegas Strip and the nearby Interstate 15 highway as they responded to the incident. McCarran International Airport said some flights had been diverted overnight due to the incident and that travelers should expect ongoing delays. Several videos posted online contained what sounded like rapid gunfire: Footage from someone who said he was at the Mandalay Bay hotel appeared to show people running from the event: Some of the festival’s performers tweeted about the incident: Mandalay Bay said in a statement that it was “grateful for the immediate actions of our first responders.” CORRECTION: A previous version of this story reported that an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester was attacked last year.

But some onlookers apparently thought this one, of Prince Harry and Melania Trump at the Invictus Games in Toronto over the weekend, is worth 666 . Harry and the first lady posed for a series of photos together before sitting down for a chat. Trump stood with her arms at her sides, while Harry’s hand was half-tucked into his jacket in a very unusual way: His ring and middle fingers were tucked inside his coat along with his thumb, while he held his pinky and pointer fingers outside. His unusual gesture ― and whether or not it was intentional ― became a hot topic over the weekend, even eclipsing Harry’s first official appearance with his American girlfriend Meghan Markle. People on Twitter and some media outlets noted it looks like Harry was giving a symbol of the devil, either signaling that he himself is the devil or that the spirit of the devil surrounded him . But two body language experts think the gesture was misread in two very different ways. Patti Wood , body language expert and author of Snap: Making the Most of First Impressions, Body Language & Charisma , told HuffPost that while Harry has held his jacket in photos before, this specific hand position is new. “This is called the horn or the devil’s horn, and what people are saying in the media about it is not correct,” she said. “It is not a sign that he’s the devil, but rather a warning off of evil spirits. It’s a protective gesture against evil or darkness and illness.” Huh. Wood said putting one’s hand on one’s stomach is an act of self-comfort, and she has previously noticed other world leaders exhibiting self-comfort in photo ops with President Donald Trump. “I’ve seen world leaders in photo shoots with Trump and I see a lot of what are called self-comfort cues,” she said. “This would be considered one of those. It looks like the devil’s horn but it is also hand to belly,” she said. “At the very least it would be a comfort cue, and show a lot of tension and a need to protect his central core.” Joe Navarro , body language expert and author of What Every Body is Saying: An Ex-FBI Agent’s Guide to Speed-Reading People , is skeptical of reading any intention in Harry’s body language. He pointed out to HuffPost that a photo is a moment in time, and a number of factors could have led to this particular positioning. “Had the photographers loitered too long? Is there something else going on?” he asked, adding, “I have to wonder, was he going to unbutton his jacket and then changed his mind? Was he in prep for sitting and then they asked him to stand again to do more photos? To me, you can’t draw too many inferences from the photo. I wouldn’t personally read too much into that.” But both experts agree that there is a level of tension visible in Harry, and both pointed out the prince usually looks much more relaxed and happy in such situations. “There was some psychological discomfort,” Navarro said. “The look of his face, the look of his hand is very unusual, except for the fact that he and his brother have a tendency to cover their belly which is a self-soothing behavior to deal with a bit of tension.” “His normal facial expression is actually typically a smile, which is wonderful and warm and engaging,” Wood said. “Here, the mouth is more closed, lips more pulled back and he’s not smiling.” Wood also noted that Melania Trump, who kept her arms pressed closely to her body the whole time (“a fear response”), looked tense, too. “If you look at their smiles, hers has enormous amount of tension. Her look is slitted eyes, closed eyes, which we do in tension. We also close our eyes when we want to attack.” Still, Navarro was firm that when it comes to Harry, we can’t draw conclusions from a weird-looking hand position. “All we can say is that it is unusual, but we can’t automatically say he intended it to be this or that,” he said. That didn’t stop Twitter users from saying it. They flooded the site with responses to the awkward photos, with many suggesting Harry was sending a subliminal message. Is the devil in the details? Unless Harry ever address his strange stance, we may never know.",69.11,8.3,10,740,740,"looks

They’re trying to get everything they can, looting the store, taking everything off the shelves like it’s the end times. The walls are closing in as the special counsel investigation continues unabated ― causing some in the GOP to to try to damage it ― and as the Resistance becomes supercharged, expanding the Democrats’ chances of making big wins in 2018. The GOP has even lost its last fig leaf of moderation―Maine senator Susan Collins―who’s been having a meltdown in the past few days after being exposed in much of the media, having voted for the Trump tax scam and not received in return promised votes on shoring up Obamacare markets. (Now GOP leaders are telling her they will come in 2018 ...sure.) Collins, who voted for Trump’s most misogynistic judicial nominees, hostile to a woman’s right to choose, has devolved into claiming she’s now a victim of an “unbelievably sexist” media, sounding every bit like what the alt-right would call a whiny snowflake. There’s been much speculation about why Republicans would pass an enormously unpopular tax bill knowing that the narrative of a tax bill at the time of its passage usually doesn’t change later, no matter what the reality turns out to be. Many have pointed to the White House and GOP leaders wanting a win of any kind, and needing to placate donors ― and even being honest about it ― taking a risk with voters. That’s certainly true for some. Others have pointed to GOP senators, some of whom are leaving Congress, benefiting personally from the bill , the most notable example being Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee flipping his vote after additions to the bill benefited real estate investors like himself (He has adamantly denied this). I’ve been saying for a while that much of the motivation, however, also seems to be desperation among many Republicans who see the handwriting on the wall. Between the Russia investigation and Trump’s plummeting approval, they know Trump will fall, or that they will soon lose control of the House and possibly the Senate ― or both. This would explain why even White House officials like Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and White House economic advisor Gary Cohn backed a plan that will hurt Trump with his base and will further his downfall: These Goldman Sachs alums, too, stand to benefit greatly from the tax bill , and they likely see that this might be the last thing they get before the Trump administration collapses. Cohn has certainly both criticized and mocked Trump enough behind his back (in addition to faking bad reception to hang up on Trump) for us to imagine he is not acting in Trump’s best political interests. Trump, too, is clearly freaking out about the Russia investigation and is desperately trying to cling to his base, no matter what the costs. The reckless announcement to r ecognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel , while it played well to several factions in Trump’s shrinking base, has caused reverberations around the world, forcing Mike Pence to cancel his trip to the Middle East , bringing a rebuke from the United Nations General Assembly and seriously raising tensions in a way that will come back to haunt Trump and the U.S. Banning transgender people from the military (though courts have put this on hold ) and the news reported last week that the Centers for Disease Control has been told by the Trump administration to ban in budget documents words and terms like “transgender,” “fetus” and “science-based,” plays to evangelicals ― whose support for Trump has dropped by 17 percent in a recent Pew poll ― but horrifies most Americans who can see signs of a turn toward fascism. But while Trump may believe these desperate moves will help him, the GOP in Congress knows that Trump can’t win again by only playing to his decimated base. Trump’s 2016 win ― without the popular vote and with Russian interference and James Comey’s recklessness ― was a fluke in which he won the Electoral College by less than 85,000 votes in three states ; his base has shrunk (and slowly keeps eroding) and nothing is bringing it back. By placating some aspects of the base ― like evangelicals ― with the aforementioned actions, he’s actually scaring away others in the base, and GOP leaders see this. From Virginia to Alabama, they know the blue wave is building into a possible tsunami next fall. They will use every sleazy tactic at their disposal, from voter suppression and ID laws to looking the other way of more possible Russian interference , but it may not be enough to overcome the wave. That will be compounded by the corruption and misjudgments of some of the candidates that the GOP’s base, often with the help of Steve Bannon and other extremists, will back in primaries ― as we saw in Virginia and Alabama. All of this means that, as horrifying and demoralizing as the current climate is, and as damaging as this tax scam will be for years to come, progressives and Democrats must stay committed and determined because of a very real shot at beating the crap out of the GOP at the ballot box in 2018. And Trump may be taken down, either before finishing his term or in 2020 (if he’s not taken down by the GOP first in GOP presidential primaries). Undoing the catastrophic damage that Trump and the GOP have created since the start of the Trump presidency will take years. Some of it may be impossible to undo, something the GOP is banking on. But it seems pretty clear that if progressives stay energized and don’t let up, Democrats will take back power. And it seems even more clear the GOP knows that.

Grady has a 7-year-old son and 2-year-old daughter. His comic offers a humorous take on classic parenting struggles, from noisy toys to toddler tantrums. Many of his drawings, however, also feature more earnest messages about tolerance, empathy and being a force for good in an often dark world. Grady, who works as an elementary school teacher in Toronto, told HuffPost he created Lunarbaboon as a form of therapy to deal with his anxiety. “I needed a positive place to focus all my thoughts and found that when I was making comics I felt a little bit better,” he said. “After posting the comics on social media for a few months, I began getting messages from many people about how they connected to the comics and it gave them hope and strength as they went through their own dark times.” As Lunarbaboon gained a bigger following, Grady decided to use his popularity for good. He often draws comics with positive messages that touch on social justice, gender issues, xenophobia and more. “I think it is impossible not to be influenced by the world around you. There is a lot of bad things happening in the world, but there is also a lot of good,” he said. “I try to find the good or humorous in the difficult things that happen to us every day.” Grady noted that his wife influences his work as well. “I am very lucky to be married to a very smart, strong, opinionated person who is constantly fighting against injustice,” he explained. “A lot of what she and I talk about on a daily basis makes it into the comics.” The response to Grady’s work has been positive. “People like knowing they aren’t alone in life’s daily struggles,” he said. Today, Lunarbaboon has more than 900,000 followers on Facebook . In April, Andrews McMeel Publishing released a book compilation of Grady’s comics called Lunarbaboon: The Daily Life of Parenthood . As a teacher and a father, Grady aims to mold young minds into caring, thoughtful members of their communities. “I want both my kids and my students to grow up to be good people,” he explained. “Kids are always watching adults, and they look to the adults as role models. I try to show them that even with all my flaws and weaknesses, I am still a good person, and I can still make a positive change in the world.” “Nobody is powerless in this world, as humans we have the ability to change another person’s day by what we put out,” he added, noting that this mindset sometimes seeps into his comics. Grady told HuffPost he hopes his comic brings people joy and inspires them to spread positivity to those around him, even in difficult times. “Although we don’t have complete control over our thoughts and emotions as we go through life, we do have control over our actions,” he said. “So do good things with your life.” Keep scrolling and visit Lunarbaboon’s website and Facebook page for more of Grady’s empowering comics.

Some passengers on flights within or bound for the U.S. may find “SSSS” printed on their boarding passes , Business Insider pointed out this week. That stands for “Secondary Security Screening Selection,” and it entails a 10- to 30-minute additional screening that may involve a thorough search of your bags , a full-body pat down , questioning about your travel plans and additional body scans . Unless something sketchy turns up, you’ll board as usual after the screening. The Transportation Security Administration ’s Secure Flight program , which is currently responsible for that “SSSS” code, has been around since 2010 and stems from laws passed after 9/11 . Travelers report seeing the ""SSSS"" code on their boarding passes years before that, so it's likely that another government program used the code earlier, according to TSA spokesman Mike England. Today, the “SSSS” code is printed on travelers’ boarding passes if they appear on an FBI counterterrorism watchlist called the Selectee List , England said. Others are assigned the “SSSS” code at random. “Secure Flight is a risk-based passenger prescreening program that enhances security by identifying low and high-risk passengers before they arrive at the airport by matching their names against trusted traveler lists and watchlists,” England told HuffPost. You may be more likely to wind up with the code if you booked your flight last-minute , booked a one-way ticket or are returning from a high-risk country , travel expert Ben Schlappig writes. Experienced flyer The Points Guy noted he seemed to get the “SSSS” code on every airport visit after taking a trip to Turkey, for reasons unknown. It’s normal for travelers to get the “SSSS” code every once in a while, but if it happens frequently, you may be on a watchlist by mistake, Lifehacker notes. You can contact the government’s Traveler Redress Inquiry Program for any issues related to screening delays and request a review, England said. Meanwhile, cross your fingers and read up on how to breeze through security with ease. CLARIFICATION : A previous version of this story said the “SSSS” code came into use in 2010. While that was when the TSA’s Secure Flight program began using the code, the TSA says another government program may have been using it before that, as travelers reported seeing it years earlier.",56.18,11.2,12.3,398,398,"secure

Al Franken (D-Minn.) touched their butts in separate incidents. These are the third and fourth such allegations against Franken in the past week. Leeann Tweeden, a radio host, wrote last week that Franken had kissed and groped her without her consent during a 2006 USO tour. On Monday, Lindsay Menz accused Franken of groping her at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. The two additional women, who said they were not familiar with each others’ stories, both spoke on condition of anonymity. But their stories, which describe events during Franken’s first campaign for the Senate, are remarkably similar — and both women have been telling them privately for years. In a statement to HuffPost, Franken said, “It’s difficult to respond to anonymous accusers, and I don’t remember those campaign events.” The first woman, who spoke to HuffPost on condition of anonymity because she’s worried she’ll be harassed online for making the allegation, said Franken groped her when they posed for a photo after a June 25, 2007, event hosted by the Minnesota Women’s Political Caucus in Minneapolis. “My story is eerily similar to Lindsay Menz’s story ,” the first woman said. “He grabbed my buttocks during a photo op.” The second woman told HuffPost that Franken cupped her butt with his hand at a 2008 Democratic fundraiser in Minneapolis, then suggested the two visit the bathroom together. She spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear that the allegation could affect her position at work. “My immediate reaction was disgust,” the second woman said. “But my secondary reaction was disappointment. I was excited to be there and to meet him. And so to have that happen really deflated me. It felt like: ‘Is this really the person who is going to be in a position of power to represent our community?’” “I can categorically say that I did not proposition anyone to join me in any bathroom,” Franken told HuffPost. ‘We Stood Next To Each Other ... And Down His Hand Went’ The first woman, a 38-year-old book editor who was living in Minneapolis at the time, told HuffPost that she had just finished performing with a feminist choir at the Women’s Political Caucus event, which Franken and his wife, Franni Bryson, attended. After the ceremony, she and other members of the choir approached him for photos. “My mother loves Al Franken. She listened to Air America [on which Franken had a radio show] every day,” the first woman said. ”I saw him and asked if we could take a photo together for my mother, and we stood next to each other ... and down his hand went.” HuffPost spoke to two sources close to the first woman who corroborated her account. One fellow choir member, Sarah, remembers not only being there for the groping incident but hearing another choir member say that Franken wouldn’t stop looking at her chest. Ten years ago, it was easier to shrug off predatory behavior as “boys being boys,” Sarah said, especially when that predatory behavior came from a political ally. “At the time ... people weren’t as willing to speak against people they felt like were on their side,” Sarah said. “It’s really disappointing. And it’s crappy. Ten years ago we were also at an age where there was still a feeling of powerlessness, or that boys will be boys.” The first woman’s best friend, who likewise wished to remain anonymous, remembers hearing about the groping incident the day after it happened. “She was in this all-women’s choir and he was at an event where she performed, and she told me that he basically grabbed her ass,” the best friend said. “It was a ‘Can you believe this happened to me?’ kind of thing.” The first woman wanted to tell her story because Franken is “a serial groper,” she said. “Only two people have come forward, and people are saying that this is a right-wing conspiracy,” she said. “It’s not. I’m a liberal person. ... I voted for him after this happened.” ‘I Was Completely Mortified’ The second woman, who said she was groped at a fundraiser, told HuffPost it took place in the fall of 2008 at the Loft Literary Center in Minneapolis. She was excited about attending the event and meeting someone she wanted to support. “I had never attended anything like that,” she said. She and her friends found Franken and introduced themselves to him. “I shook his hand, and he put his arm around my waist and held it there,” the second woman said. “Then he moved it lower and cupped my butt.” “I was completely mortified,” she added. In order to escape the situation, the woman excused herself to go to the bathroom. At that point, she said, Franken leaned in and suggested that he accompany her. She grabbed her friend and fled to the bathroom without him. The second woman told several people ― including one of the reporters for this story, Zachary Roth ― about the incident some years ago, but didn’t want it reported then. She said she didn’t tell anyone at the time of the incident because inappropriate behavior from men was not that unusual to her or her friends. “Sexual harassment happens so often, you have to learn how to move on,” she said, describing her thinking at the time. Several other factors also left her feeling powerless. “I felt like I didn’t have a voice,” she said. “This man had all of the power, all of the authority. In addition, he is a white man and I am a woman of color. I was 21 years old. And I was afraid that he would use all of those privileges to discredit me, to make me feel even smaller than I already felt.” Today, she said, she feels more confident, in part thanks to the flood of women who have come forward over the last month to share stories of sexual harassment by powerful men. “I couldn’t see all these other women come forward and not walk the walk myself,” she said. “I wanted my report to be a way for other women to say, ‘Yes, that happened to me and I don’t have to be afraid.’” Like the second woman, the first woman waited years before deciding to go public with her story. She laughed off the incident at the time, she said, even telling other people about it as a sort of “party trick.” It wasn’t until recently, she said, that she felt safe talking about how uncomfortable she’d felt. On Oct. 12, shortly after The New York Times and The New Yorker published bombshell reports about sexual assault claims against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein that drove the #MeToo social media campaign to new heights, the first woman posted on Facebook about her experience. “Are we all sharing which famous man has groped us?” she wrote. “Mine’s Al Franken.” “Men should be held to the same standards regardless of their politics,” she said. “He’s an imperfect messenger for a progressive platform. He can’t claim to be ‘for women’ and also grope them.” Do you have a similar story? Email us at scoops@huffpost.com, or message us securely .",72.76,6.9,10.2,1199,1199,"franken

The two additional women, who said they were not familiar with each others’ stories, both spoke on condition of anonymity.
But their stories, which describe events during Franken’s first campaign for the Senate, are remarkably similar — and both women have been telling them privately for years.
In a statement to HuffPost, Franken said, “It’s difficult to respond to anonymous accusers, and I don’t remember those campaign events.” The first woman, who spoke to HuffPost on condition of anonymity because she’s worried she’ll be harassed online for making the allegation, said Franken groped her when they posed for a photo after a June 25, 2007, event hosted by the Minnesota Women’s Political Caucus in Minneapolis.
“He grabbed my buttocks during a photo op.” The second woman told HuffPost that Franken cupped her butt with his hand at a 2008 Democratic fundraiser in Minneapolis, then suggested the two visit the bathroom together.
“My immediate reaction was disgust,” the second woman said.
It felt like: ‘Is this really the person who is going to be in a position of power to represent our community?’” “I can categorically say that I did not proposition anyone to join me in any bathroom,” Franken told HuffPost.

It also features the elbow of another woman whose face is not visible. “The image you see partially on the cover is of a woman we talked to, a hospital worker from the middle of the country, who doesn’t feel that she can come forward without threatening her livelihood,” Time editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal said Wednesday on “Today.” The anonymous woman’s arm also represents the many women and men who are afraid to come forward with their own stories, Felsenthal said. The anonymous woman, 28, shared her harrowing experience with the magazine, and captured how many people feel after being assaulted or harassed. “I thought, ‘What just happened? Why didn’t I react?’” she said, noting that she can still feel the heat of her harassers’ hands on her body. “I kept thinking, ‘Did I do something, did I say something, did I look a certain way to make him think that was OK?’” Charlotte Alter, Time’s national correspondent, also told BuzzFeed that the inclusion of the elbow was “very intentional.” “A huge part of this story is that as much as the stigma around this has been removed this year because of the ‘Me Too’ movement, it’s still really difficult for a lot of people to come forward,” she told the outlet. Alter also noted that it’s difficult for some people to share their stories because they don’t have the “resources to weather what would happen if they lost their jobs or they couldn’t support their families.” “So we wanted to include people that reference the risk these women are taking by speaking out about this,” she said.",53.95,12.1,13,359,359,"time

On June 14, 1923, or Flag Day, a federal code was put in place that would serve as a guideline for how to handle the American flag. A viral Twitter thread brought the almost century-old standards back into the spotlight on Saturday. There are several sections in the code about proper national anthem conduct, how to display the flag, and how to respect the flag in general . The code does state that everyone during the national anthem, “all present except those in uniform should stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart,” but the guidelines are not legally binding ― more like official suggestions about how to treat what the code calls “a living thing.” Here are some things that Americans do on a regular basis that are considered disrespectful according to the Flag Code:  American flag clothing “The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery. It should never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds, but always allowed to fall free.” That means every American flag swimsuit, button-up shirt, and even those famous Old Navy flag shirts, can be considered disrespectful.  The flag shouldn’t be carried flat “The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.” Most people know the flag should never touch the ground, but few know that it has to be displayed vertically. Maybe it’s a nod to the lyric that had the flag “gallantly streaming” in the air. Whatever the case, an unfurled flag that sits flat is a disrespect to the Flag Code.  Drawing on the flag “The flag should never have placed upon it, nor on any part of it, nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature.” This one seems pretty self-explanatory. Most people understand that drawing on the symbol of the country will probably be seen as disrespectful. But freedom of expression is a constitutionally protected right, so artists (and the rest of us) are still free to make that choice.  Disposable flag products “It should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions or handkerchiefs and the like, printed or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard.” Sorry to put a damper on probably every Fourth of July cookout ever, but if the paper plate supporting that juicy burger has a flag on it, the Flag Code says that’s disrespectful.  Flag advertisements “The flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever.” If a business or company is using a flag in its advertisements, that’s yet another disrespectful gesture. A flag printed on a disposable flier is probably a double offense.  Flag uniforms “No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform. However, a flag patch may be affixed to the uniform of military personnel, firemen, policemen, and members of patriotic organizations.” It seems like sports teams are running afoul of the guidelines by putting the flag on uniforms. The only way to respectfully wear the American flag on a costume is with a “patch” on the side of the uniform for service members, firefighters and police officers, according to the code. This article has been updated to include more details about the code’s legal standing and its rules about conduct during the national anthem.",56.79,11,12.6,593,593,"flag

One German city was faced with exactly that problem. A viral post on Twitter from Cleve Jones shares the story of Wunsiedel in northeast Bavaria, which has been a neo-Nazi destination since it was once home to the grave of Adolf Hitler’s deputy, Rudolf Hess . But in 2014, sponsors agreed to donate money for each step marched by the neo-Nazis , with the cash going to programs that fight Nazis, the Guardian reported at the time. It was billed as Germany’s most involuntary walkathon. Instead of greeting the group with protests, they put up banners welcoming them to the “Nazis Against Nazis” walkathon , according to a video on a YouTube channel run by the organization that promoted it. Mocking signs throughout the route encouraged them to keep walking to raise more money, and organizers put out a table of bananas to help them keep up their energy so they could keep walking ― and keep raising money. They even painted numbers in the ground so the neo-Nazi marchers would be forced to see how much money they’d collected at every milestone. And at the end, they passed out certificates reminding them of how much many they raised to fight Nazis : 10,000 euros, or close to $12,000, going to EXIT Deutschland , a group that helps neo-Nazis to defect from the movement. A report on the event by Britain’s SOFII Foundation found that it was so successful other communities began emulating it. “The campaign inspired other cities in Germany and other countries to have a new, creative and amusing way of handling the problem of Nazi-walks,” the organization said.",62.92,10.7,10.8,276,276,"nazis

One of the most talked about scenes from “ Game of Thrones ” Season 7, Episode 4 ( besides the dragon ) was the sparring session between Arya (Maisie Williams) and Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie). First, that fight is just awesome, but, more significantly, it may have established Arya as the best swordsperson in Westeros. Now, that scene is drawing attention for other reasons. One fan thinks they may have spotted the actual ghost of Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) in the background. The moment happens right after Arya reminds Brienne of her vow to Catelyn. “You swore to serve both my mother’s daughters,” says Arya. As Redditor GrennsGal points out, at the word “mother,” you can see “a woman in a long green dress w/ long auburn wavy hair with her head down walking past the background gate, resembling Cat”: Uh, is winter coming? Because we just got the chills. In George R.R. Martin ’s books, Catelyn Stark comes back in a zombified version of herself and goes by the name of Lady Stoneheart . She seeks revenge on the Freys for the Red Wedding, a role Arya has basically filled in Season 7. Since the character wasn’t included in the show, and because every line and appearance on “Game of Thrones” is so critical, fans think the Catelyn Stark-looking character in the background could be a creepy Stoneheart nod. After all, in the books, Stoneheart plays a critical role in Brienne and Podrick’s story. Perhaps it’s even a subtle Easter egg for Martin, who has admitted he was disappointed that Stoneheart was excluded from the HBO series. “That was probably the first major diversion of the show from the books and, you know, I argued against that, and David [Benioff] and Dan [Weiss] made that decision,” he told Time. When watching the scene from the latest episode, the mysterious character seems to appear two times. First, you can see her when Arya says the line about Brienne’s vow to Catelyn: Redditor microhive , who agrees the moment is creepy as heck, points out the character seems to appear later as well, again behind Arya: (All men must be creeped out.) Is this just a coincidence? Could that be Catelyn? Did “Game of Thrones” just do a bizarre crossover with Merida from “Brave” ? As GrennsGal says, “If it’s unintentional, it’s awesome. If not, more awesome. Catelyn che[c]king on Brienne keeping her vows.” H/T Reddit",71.44,7.4,9.9,417,417,"stoneheart

During an appearance on NBC’s “Today” show Wednesday, the head of Lakewood Church said its doors have “always been open.” Minutes later, he appeared to reverse course and admit that the church hadn’t initially encouraged victims to seek shelter there. “If people were here, they’d realize there were safety issues,” Osteen said. “We were just being precautious, but the main thing is the city didn’t ask us to become a shelter then.” Dozens of Houston-area churches, mosques , schools and community centers opened their doors to offer temporary shelter as Harvey pummeled the city earlier this week. Lakewood Church, however, posted on Sunday that its building was “inaccessible” due to flooding and encouraged people to seek shelter elsewhere. After backlash mounted on social media, a spokesman for the church announced Tuesday that it was prepared to shelter displaced people ― “once the cities and county shelters reach capacity.” When asked if he would have done anything differently to avoid the onslaught of criticism aimed at him over the last few days, Osteen said he would. “Yeah, I’m sure we would have done something differently,” Osteen said.

Minutes after Trump’s speech, Duke lashed out in a series of tweets , claiming the president had been manipulated by the media. “It’s amazing to see how the media is able to bully the President of the United States into going along with their FAKE NEWS narrative,” Duke tweeted. Soon after that, in an anti-Semitic, racist Periscope video rant , Duke spoke directly to Trump, claiming white nationalists abhor violence. He said “it’s just ridiculous” that the president felt he had to make Monday’s statement. “President Trump, please, for God’s sake, don’t feel like you need to say these things,” Duke admonished in the video. “It’s not going to do you any good.” Duke also stuck up for James Alex Fields, 20, the white nationalist motorist accused of ramming his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing Heather Heyer, 32. “When you’re under attack ... you panic and you do things that are stupid and you do things that are wrong,” Duke said.

Duke at the time appeared to warn the president against calling out white nationalists, a group that has largely embraced Trump.

Elizabeth Shackelford, who served as a political officer based in Nairobi for the U.S. mission to Somalia, lamented in a Nov. 7 letter obtained by Foreign Policy the “stinging disrespect” President Donald Trump’s administration had shown the diplomatic corps and how it was “driving” the department’s most experienced staff away in growing numbers. “The cost of this is visible every day in Mission Somalia, my current post, where State’s diplomatic influence, on the country and within our own interagency, is waning,” Shackelford wrote. She said she was “shocked” when Tillerson, who stepped down as Exxon Mobil CEO to serve as Trump’s secretary of state, told department employees that advancing human rights across the globe “creates obstacles to our ability to advance our national security interests.“ If Tillerson is unable to “stem the bleeding” and preserve the department’s mission, she added, “I would humbly recommend you follow me out the door.” Trump’s administration has been harshly criticized for downplaying human rights issues in countries like Russia, Turkey, and the Philippines. Democratic lawmakers and former ambassadors have also accused Tillerson of gutting the department’s budget and staff at a critical and dangerous time, as difficult foreign policy challenges persist in the Middle East and on the Korean peninsula. Tillerson, who has still has not denied having called Trump a “ moron ” in private earlier this year, has been the subject of a raft of rumors that his time at the State Department will be short-lived. The White House last month reportedly floated a plan about replacing Tillerson with CIA Director Mike Pompeo in order to help push out the secretary of state.

Just as Kit Harington promised, right from the start of “ Game of Thrones ” Season 7 there’s tension between Sansa ( Sophie Turner ) and Harington’s Jon Snow. The eldest Stark daughter almost immediately questions Jon’s decisions in front of the Northern lords. Sansa argues for breaking up the lands of the Northern houses that betrayed the Starks and fought for Ramsay Bolton by giving their castles to loyal families. But Jon, nobly yet also kind of stupidly, is like, “Nah, they cool,” and just makes their kids pledge loyalty to House Stark. Now, it seems subtle details in the show are hinting that even darker times could lie ahead for the siblings. In a private chat after the meeting with the Northern houses, Sansa implores Jon to listen to her and not make the same dumb mistakes their father Ned and brother Robb made. Just then, Jon gets a raven with a threatening note from Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey) and, again, doesn’t listen to Sansa. It’s during this scene that we noticed something peculiar. After Jon basically ignores Cersei’s threats, Sansa says, “You’re the military man, but I know her. If you’re her enemy, she’ll never stop until she’s destroyed you. Everyone who’s ever crossed her she’s found a way to murder.” “You almost sound as if you admire her,” replies Jon. “I learned a great deal from her,” she says. That’s when it hit us. Sansa is rocking Cersei’s hairdo! Hair ... take another look: The ’do is very similar to many of Cersei’s looks from earlier episodes. (Cersei’s image above is taken from Season 3, Episode 1 ). We weren’t the only ones who noticed. Some Twitter users picked up on the similarities, too. Turner already revealed in an interview with Refinery 29 that Sansa’s hair reflects the “people she’s learning from, or mimicking, or inspired by.” The fact that she’s channeling Cersei while having a disagreement with Jon is pretty unnerving, especially considering she just said that she’s “learned a great deal” from a woman who always finds a way of murdering her enemies. (Oh, Snow she didn’t!) Is Sansa becoming the new Cersei? Does this foreshadow a dangerous animosity between the pair? Is there only one hairstylist in Westeros? All valid questions. Whatever the answers are, it seems like Jon Snow’s about to find himself in a hairy situation.",74.08,6.4,9.5,394,394,"jon

The president sent out three inexplicable tweets on Wednesday announcing the ban of transgender people from serving in the U.S. military “in any capacity.” Apparently in response, Lahren, known for making incendiary statements such as calling the Black Lives Matter movement “the new KKK,” tweeted her approval. “Pres Trump dedicated to putting radical Muslims in graves whereas Pres Obama was dedicated to putting men in ladies room,” wrote Lahren. Rowling decided to correct her. “Truly, whom amongst us can forget Trump ordering the killing of bin Laden? Or Obama bragging about barging in on naked beauty contestants?” said Rowling in a burn worse than any “Harry Potter” incendio charm could manage. The author is of course referring to the time Trump, who owned the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants, infamously told Howard Stern he would walk backstage while contestants were dressing . In response to Trump’s announcement of the ban, the author also retweeted a poignant message: With the author’s comments on Lahren’s tweet, as well as the other backlash from celebrities on Trump’s decision, it looks like Rowling could have all the makings of a new Dumbledore’s Army on her hands.

A recent poll conducted by Politico and Morning Consult found that half of registered voters believe the allegations against Trump are credible.

The accusation comes a day after Weinstein was the subject of a bombshell New York Times report that revealed that he has settled at least eight sexual harassment claims. The incident took place a decade ago, according to Lauren Sivan, who at the time was a news anchor on a local cable channel in New York, Long Island 12. She says the experience left her shocked, and that while she told friends privately what happened, she remained quiet because she was in a long-term relationship and fearful of the power that Weinstein wielded in the media. Sivan told HuffPost about the incident with Weinstein in an on-record interview. A list of detailed questions was emailed to a Weinstein Company publicist. While the publicist acknowledged receiving the questions, multiple attempts to get a response were unsuccessful. In a text message, Lisa Bloom, Weinstein’s attorney, said Weinstein was not available for an interview. The night of the incident started with Sivan meeting Weinstein and others at Cipriani, a well-known Italian restaurant in Manhattan. She later rode with him and others to Socialista, a Cuban-themed club and restaurant in which Weinstein and Giuseppe Cipriani, who was then the head of the Cipriani restaurant empire, were investors. Sivan noted to HuffPost that Weinstein’s car was “stocked full of cases of Diet Coke,” which she said she found to be odd. In a 2001 profile of Weinstein in New York Magazine, journalist David Carr noted that while sitting at a table, Weinstein had “three Diet Cokes on standby in front of him.” A spokeswoman for Cipriani confirmed that he and Weinstein have been friends for many years but declined to comment further. HuffPost spoke to a friend of Sivan’s who was with her that night who corroborated details of Sivan’s story prior to and after the incident in the restaurant hallway, and shared additional details about that evening. Sivan’s friend spoke to HuffPost on the condition of anonymity because she wasn’t authorized by her employer to speak to members of the press about any topic. Sivan recalled that, while at the club, Weinstein asked her to join him on a tour of its restaurant, Cafe Socialista. Sivan said she reluctantly agreed and they went downstairs to the restaurant. Just before Sivan left, the friend told her that if she wasn’t back in 10 minutes, she would come to check on her. Once Sivan and Weinstein were downstairs they chatted and he showed her the cafe. He then took her to the kitchen (the restaurant was closed by that time), where a couple of staffers were cleaning up. The quiet in the kitchen struck Silvan as odd, but a story published in 2008 said that Cafe Socialista was closing down for a lack of business (while the club was to remain open), possibly explaining why the kitchen wasn’t as populated. Weinstein then dismissed the two staffers in the kitchen. According to multiple women who spoke to HuffPost on the condition of anonymity who said they had similar experiences with Weinstein, he has started out meetings or interactions with other people in the room and then dismissed them to be alone with women in order to make advances. Once they left, Sivan says Weinstein leaned in and tried to kiss her. Sivan rejected that attempt and told him she had a long-term boyfriend. Weinstein then said to Sivan, “Well, can you just stand there and shut up.” At this point, Weinstein and Sivan were in a vestibule between the kitchen and bathrooms. The only way for Sivan to get away from Weinstein required her to get past him and go through the kitchen. Sivan says she was trapped by Weinstein’s body and was intimidated. Weinstein then proceeded to expose himself to Sivan and began to masturbate. Sivan said she was deeply shocked by Weinstein’s behavior and was frozen and didn’t know what to do or say. The incident in the vestibule didn’t last long. Sivan says Weinstein ejaculated quickly into a potted plant that was in the vestibule and then proceeded to zip up his pants and they walked back into the kitchen. By the time this occurred, Sivan’s friend had grown concerned by how long Sivan was gone. The friend began to go downstairs but was stopped by a security guard who told her she was not allowed. She says that she explained the 10-minute limit she gave to Sivan and said, “ Do you mean to tell me if she’s in trouble down there, you’re not going to let me in?” The security guard agreed to let the friend down to the cafe. Once she got downstairs, she met Sivan and Weinstein who were leaving the kitchen. Sivan and her friend left just after the encounter, and both of them recalled Sivan discussing what had happened as soon as they left Socialista. Sivan said Weinstein called her office the next day while she was at work. Sivan says Weinstein told her that he “had a great time last night.” Weinstein mentioned that he was going on a foreign trip and asked if Sivan wanted to get together when he got back. Sivan reminded him that she was in a relationship and says she quickly ended the call. She has not interacted with Weinstein since the incident in 2007. The Weinstein Company announced Friday that Weinstein was going on an indefinite leave pending investigation of the sexual harassment claims by an independent law firm.

The quiet in the kitchen struck Silvan as odd, but a story published in 2008 said that Cafe Socialista was closing down for a lack of business (while the club was to remain open), possibly explaining why the kitchen wasn’t as populated.
According to multiple women who spoke to HuffPost on the condition of anonymity who said they had similar experiences with Weinstein, he has started out meetings or interactions with other people in the room and then dismissed them to be alone with women in order to make advances.
Sivan says Weinstein ejaculated quickly into a potted plant that was in the vestibule and then proceeded to zip up his pants and they walked back into the kitchen.
She says that she explained the 10-minute limit she gave to Sivan and said, “ Do you mean to tell me if she’s in trouble down there, you’re not going to let me in?” The security guard agreed to let the friend down to the cafe.
Sivan says Weinstein told her that he “had a great time last night.” Weinstein mentioned that he was going on a foreign trip and asked if Sivan wanted to get together when he got back."

The talk show host filmed an eight-minute long segment on Monday, just hours after at least 59 people were killed and over 500 were injured by a gunman who opened fire on a crowd attending the Route 91 Harvest Festival. The video, above, which was released on Tuesday morning, begins with a visibly emotional DeGeneres stating that her “heart is broken for everyone affected by what happened.” While she admits that she feels “sad,” “anxious” and “helpless,” and that it’s “very easy to lose hope” during moments like these, she is adamant that “we cannot do that” because “there’s a lot more good in the world than there is bad and I continue to believe that.” “It’s hard to do a show on a day like this,” she said. “When I wake up [on a day like] today I think, How am I going to do a show? But it’s also days like this that I appreciate my job more than ever because I get to focus and shine a light on people that do good in the world.” And that’s exactly what DeGeneres did by highlighting some of the incredible do-gooders she’s featured on her show over the last 15 years.

On Saturday night, Obama quoted former South African President Nelson Mandela in a series of tweets: The first of the bunch, in which Obama is smiling at children of different ethnicities, topped 2.8 million likes on Tuesday night. A tweet by Ariana Grande following the deadly bombing in May at the end of her concert in Manchester, England, previously held the top spot with 2.7 million likes. Obama tweeted the quote from Mandela’s autobiography Long Walk to Freedom a few hours after James Alex Fields Jr., 20, plowed his car into marchers protesting the “Unite the Right” rally attended by various white supremacist groups on Saturday, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer . Also killed that day were two on-duty Virginia state troopers whose helicopter crashed on the outskirts of Charlottesville. President Donald Trump responded to the clashes in Charlottesville in a very different way on Saturday, saying: “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides ― on many sides,” Trump said on national television. “It’s been going on for a long time in our country, not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama. It’s been going on for a long, long time.” Trump also tweeted about the violence numerous times on Saturday. None of his tweets, however, specifically condemned any white supremacy extremist groups. Trump’s most popular tweet addressing the events in Charlottesville on Saturday had not gotten more than 190,000 likes as of Tuesday morning. The others didn’t exceed 125,000 likes. Facing bipartisan criticism over his initial responses, Trump on Monday was more explicit in comments he made at the White House. “Racism is evil, and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, Neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to what we hold dear as Americans,” he said.

The president suggested that officers should hit suspects’ heads on the doors of their police cars. “When you see these towns and when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see them thrown in, rough, and I said, ‘Please don’t be too nice,’” Trump said. “Like when you guys put somebody in the car and you’re protecting their head, you know, the way you put their hand over, like, don’t hit their head and they’ve just killed somebody, don’t hit their head, I said, ‘You can take the hand away, OK?’” he added. His remarks received significant applause. Trump also made the dubious claim that laws were “horrendously stacked” against police officers and said he wants to change those laws. “For years and years, [laws have] been made to protect the criminal,” Trump said. “Totally protect the criminal, not the officers. You do something wrong, you’re in more jeopardy than they are. These laws are stacked against you. We’re changing those laws.” In his speech, Trump also said that police officers in many parts of the country couldn’t do their jobs because they had a “pathetic mayor” or a mayor “who doesn’t know what’s going on.” Those comments also received a lengthy applause. “It’s sad, it’s sad. You look at what’s happening, and it’s sad,” Trump said. “We’re going to support you like you’ve never been supported before.” Trump also spoke about violence in Chicago, which was a consistent theme of his speeches throughout the campaign and is a topic he has continued to reference during his presidency. Trump recalled speaking to an “impressive” and “rough cookie” police officer from Chicago, and said the officer had told him he could straighten out the city’s violence problem in a “couple of days” if he was given the authority. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Trump may not be getting along these days, but the two are on the same page when it comes to policing. Sessions has had the Justice Department pull back from “pattern or practice” investigations that look into widespread constitutional abuses in police departments. Zeke Johnson, senior director of programs at Amnesty International USA, said Trump’s “inflammatory and hateful speech will only escalate tensions between police and communities,” putting both officers and civilians at risk. “Police cannot treat every community like an invading army, and encouraging violence by police is irresponsible and reprehensible,” he said. Vanita Gupta, who headed the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division under former President Barack Obama, said Trump’s remarks were “unconscionable” and undermined the positive efforts of local law enforcement to build up community trust. “The president of the United States, standing before an audience of law enforcement officials, actively encouraged police violence,” Gupta said. “We call on the president to immediately and unequivocally condemn police brutality. We can all respect our law enforcement officers without sanctioning unjust and illegal behavior.” Robert Driscoll, a former Justice Department Civil Rights Division official under the President George W. Bush administration, was also critical.",52.9,10.4,12.7,531,531,"police

To Jack Rosenthal, the hate-filled imagery was something he never thought he’d see again, at least not in the United States. Rosenthal is one of 10,000 Romanian refugees who came to America after World War II. At 88 years old, he still mourns the loss of seven family members who died in the Auschwitz death camp. He was the only one to survive. He was born and raised in a farming village in northern Romania. “Altogether in my village, there were 26 Jewish families,” Rosenthal told HuffPost. Most of them didn’t survive either. Ultimately, hundreds of thousands of Romanian Jews were massacred in pogroms, slaughtered in death camps or otherwise murdered by Romanian authorities, German forces and others during the war. Rosenthal was 16 when he was taken to Auschwitz, the German Nazi camp in occupied Poland. Later, he was transferred to Buchenwald, another camp near Weimar, Germany, where he was forced to work for the Nazis ― the only reason he was kept alive until U.S. military forces began to evacuate the camp’s 28,000 prisoners in 1945. He came to the U.S. hoping to find a new beginning. “After I was liberated, I thought to myself the world has learned what terrible traces hate can bring to humanity,” he said. “And now this gives me a depressing feeling because it’s happening again, and it’s happening now.” The successful real estate agent watched the protests from his home in Roslyn, New York, where he lives during the warmer months of the year. In the winter, Rosenthal flies to Florida. Decades later, he remembers how hard it was to get settled in the U.S. while dealing with the trauma from the war. “When I came here, I used to get really bad nightmares and I would get up in middle of the night not being able to go back to sleep,” he said. Those days of lingering fear and uncertainty felt much closer after watching neo-Nazis rage during the violent demonstrations in Charlottesville, he said. But after all the anti-Semitic speeches and the deadly car attack , it was one particular detail that caught Rosenthal’s attention. He noticed it while reading about a Aug. 14 court hearing for James Alex Fields Jr., the man accused of plowing his car into a crowd of counterprotesters at the white nationalist rally, leaving a 32-year-old woman dead and injuring at least 19 other people. The article included a photo of Matthew Heimbach, who had helped promote the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, voicing his displeasure outside the courtroom after a judge denied bail for Fields. The white supremacist’s T-shirt was the first thing Rosenthal saw. On the shirt was a picture of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, a pre-WWII leader of the Romanian fascist Legion of Saint Michael the Archangel and the Iron Guard political party, which were both linked to the Nazi party. Codreanu urged the destruction of the Jewish community in Romania. Members of his Iron Guard responded with brutality both before and during the war, including a horrifying massacre in Bucharest that killed over 100 Jews. “I recognized the name right away,” Rosenthal said. “You see something like this, you know, it brings back memories and I’m concerned about what could happen in this country,” he said. The groups behind the Unite the Right rally are not the only ones of their kind. According to a February report from the Southern Poverty Law Center , at least 917 hate groups exist throughout the country. Many Americans were concerned when President Donald Trump failed to immediately condemn white supremacy in responding to the Charlottesville violence. Instead, Trump blamed both sides of the protests ― a point he repeated on Tuesday. “You cannot compare fascism and Nazis to the other people protesting. Maybe there are people on both sides who are misguided, but there is simply no comparison,” Rosenthal said. And he reminded us that the consequences of going through horrific violence never really end. “It’s 70 years after the war and it still has a tremendous impact on me,” he said. “It’s something I’ll never forget and that’ll always be with me as long as I live.” CORRECTION: Due to an editing error, the number of Jews killed by the Iron Guard was significantly overstated in an earlier version of the story. The individual pogroms that killed thousands and tens of thousands of Jews in Romania during World War II were carried out by official Romanian and German forces.",62.38,8.9,10.9,762,762,"rosenthal

Lagunas told HuffPost that to prepare for the trip, he had to apply for his first passport and Ramos needed to get hers renewed. The couple decided to go to Costco to take some totally normal-looking passport photos. For instance, here is the photo Ramos took: In late July, Ramos’ new passport was sent to her in the mail. When she opened it, this is what she saw: And just for good measure, here’s a side-by-side comparison: “Chelsey was furious,” Lagunas told HuffPost. “And rightly so. She paid good money for an official ID from the State Department and it came out wrong, completely wrong, wouldn’t-pass-through-customs wrong.” But, personally, Lagunas found the whole thing hilarious. “As soon as I saw it I just started laughing. It’s one of the funniest ‘bloopers’ I’ve ever seen ... and it wasn’t mine!” Lagunas posted the State Department fail to Reddit late last week, and the post quickly blew up. Of course, there were a few “Coneheads” jokes. As far as fixing the messed-up passport, Lagunas says the State Department has been “super helpful” in remedying the error and Ramos has already sent the wonky passport back and is waiting for her new one. Here’s hoping these two ultimately have a great time eating their way through Germany!",73.47,6.7,10.3,250,250,"lagunas

During what was supposed to be a stump speech for Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.), Trump drifted away from campaigning to ask members of the crowd if they’d “ love to see one of these NFL owners , when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, he’s fired’?” He also encouraged fans to boycott the league over the protests. Trump did not reference by name San Francisco 49ers former player Colin Kaepernick , who took a knee during the national anthem before games last year to protest police brutality and racial injustice. But his comments were interpreted as a thinly veiled attack on the athlete, who remains a free agent, and other players he has inspired to take similar action. Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman, wide receiver Doug Baldwin and former running back Reggie Bush were among those to call out Trump for his remarks: DeMaurice Smith, the executive director of the NFL Players Association, also made his position crystal clear via this statement on Twitter: NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell also released a statement in which it said that “divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect” for the league and its players. Stephen Ross, owner of the Miami Dolphins, said that he personally knows some of the NFL players who are protesting and said they were “smart young men of character who want to make our world a better place.” He called for “unifying leadership” and “civil discourse” instead of “condemnation and sound bites.” Hundreds of other tweeters joined in with blasting Trump, with many accusing him of trying to prevent people from exercising their First Amendment rights. The hashtag #takeaknee also began trending globally on Twitter.

The family of Sydney Loofe made the announcement Monday night on a Facebook page they’d created to help raise awareness about Loofe’s disappearance. “It’s with heavy hearts that we share this most recent update with you all,” the message reads. “Please continue to pray for Sydney and our entire family. May God grant eternal rest unto thee. We love you Sydney.” The Antelope County Sheriff’s Office also shared the news on its official Facebook page, “Our thoughts and prayers are with the Loofe family … No other details are known at this time.” According to Randy Thysse, special agent in charge of the Omaha division of the FBI, Loofe’s body was discovered Monday afternoon in an “open area” of rural Clay County. The location is roughly 90 miles southwest of Lincoln. “On behalf of the FBI, we extend our deepest heartfelt condolences to Sydney’s parents, George and Susie, her brother and sister, her friends, an all that were very fortunate enough to know her,” Thysse said during a press conference . While investigators believe the body belongs to Loofe, Thysee said a positive identification will not be made official until after autopsy. He was unable to say when that will occur. “We are indeed conducting a very through investigation to ensure we can provide an accurate account of what happened to Sydney,” he said. “An investigation like this takes resources and time. We ask for your patience.” Also speaking at the press conference was Lincoln Police Chief Jeff Bliemeister, who credited the discovery of the body to the “analysis of digital evidence” and “putting people on the ground.” Asked by a reporter if evidence was found at the scene, Bliemeister said, “We do believe that there is evidence of foul play and we will continue ... to determine exactly what that is.” Loofe, of Lincoln, was last heard from by her family on Nov. 15. That evening, she went on a second date with a woman she’d met online. The woman she was last seen with, 23-year-old Bailey Boswell, admitted she was with Loofe in the hours before she was reported missing, police said. Boswell, of Wilber, was arrested last week in an unrelated drug case. Her roommate, 51-year-old Aubrey Trail, was also picked up on a charge unrelated to Loofe’s disappearance. Authorities said Trail faces a charge of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person. Prior to their arrests, Boswell and Trail posted several bizarre videos online in which they addressed reports about their possible involvement in Loofe’s disappearance. “I’ve never killed anyone in my life and I’ve never hurt a female in my life, so take that for whatever the hell that’s worth,” Trail says in one of the videos. Despite being named “persons of interest” by authorities, investigators have not filed charges against Boswell or Trail in Loofe’s disappearance. Tips? Feedback?

And one British Christian leader is convinced that Pompeii provides important lessons for Christians ― particularly those who want to use the Bible to persecute queer people. The Rev. Canon Steve Chalke is a prominent evangelical Christian from the United Kingdom. In a video created for the Oasis Open Church Network , an organization Chalke heads that advocates for LGBTQ inclusion, Chalke preaches about the importance of understanding the context in which the Bible was written. “500 years ago, Martin Luther and Calvin didn’t have the tools that we now have to assist us in our contextual understanding of the writings of scriptures. We’ve come miles because of the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, miles because of archaeological discoveries around Pompeii, and we’ve had all sorts of other cultural and linguistic leaps forward,” Chalke told HuffPost. “It’s our job to use them and I think in using them, we find these old understandings really don’t work anymore.” There are six passages in the Bible that refer to same-sex behavior in some way. These verses are often referred by progressive Christians as “clobber passages” because they are repeatedly used to reject, demean, and attack queer Christians. Three of these passages are located in the New Testament, in the books of Romans, 1 Corinthians, and 1 Timothy. Another passage that conservative Christians sometimes refer to is Matthew 19, where Jesus speaks about divorce. It’s these verses that Chalke turns to in his defense of queer Christianity. Chalke explains that the Apostle Paul was writing during a time when it was perfectly acceptable for people on the lower rungs of society ― slaves, prostitutes, gladiators, refugees ― to be sexually exploited and abused by rich and powerful Roman citizens. The minister claims it was normal and even expected for Roman men to have sexual playthings apart from their wives. This meant having sex with concubines and young boys. Some Roman women also used people of lower status for their own sexual pleasure, Chalke said. But one thing Romans couldn’t do was abuse another Roman citizen. “Roman boys were protected in a way that slave boys weren’t. For a Roman man, sex was a legitimate part of life, but you had to have sex with an inferior and you had to penetrate them, you weren’t allowed to be penetrated,” Chalke said in his talk. In order to illustrate the time period in which these words were written, Chalke turns to August 24, 79 A.D. , the day historians believe the eruption of Mount Vesuvius began, burying and preserving nearby towns in around 20 feet of volcanic ash and debris. It was roughly around the same time period that evangelicals believe the Apostle Paul wrote the letters that would one day form a significant part of the New Testament. Much of the artwork recovered from Pompeii and other nearby towns affected by the eruption is sexually explicit. There are scenes of threesomes and people in a variety of sexual positions. After excavation of the site began in the 19th century, King Francis I of the Two Sicilies was so appalled by the sexual nature of the artwork that he ordered all explicit imagery from Pompeii at the National Archeological Museum of Naples to be locked away and out of sight from general display. Chalke said it’s important to keep this context in mind when looking at the clobber passages in the New Testament. For him, the erotic artwork of Pompeii is a sign that Roman society was “drenched” in sex. The upper classes of that time used sex in a way that ignored the basic humanity of the people who served them. It was this kind of exploitation of fellow human beings that Chalke believes Paul and other New Testament writers were speaking out against when they wrote these ancient scriptures. When 1 Timothy and 1 Corinthians make references to men who have sex with other men,  it’s part of a much longer list of people who are exploitative ― murderers, slave traders, liars, perjurers, thieves, the greedy, slanderers, swindlers. Chalke believes Paul is warning the early Christian church against engaging in human relationships that are based on exploitation, abuse, and corruption. On the other hand, he claims, the New Testament has nothing to say about genuine, compassionate love between people of the same gender, as it is understood in today’s world. “The people Paul is talking about, he said they’ve abandoned God, they’re full of deceit, lying,” Chalke told HuffPost. “Whoever Paul is talking about, it cannot be the wonderful same-sex couples that are in our church, or the gay man or the transgender woman I know. It just can’t be them.” What the New Testament does say, time and time again, is clear to Chalke in the video: “Don’t exploit. Don’t abuse. Live together in harmony. Include. Work at relationships.” Chalke declared his support for committed, monogamous same-sex relationships in 2013 . Since then, he has preached often about the “spiritual, mental and physical harm” that queer people face because of some Christians’ discriminatory attitudes. And he’s advocated for the wider welcome of queer Christians in the church ― despite being rejected from conservative evangelical circles for doing so. He is currently the senior minister of Oasis Church Waterloo , which he says is a spiritual home for a number of LGBTQ Christians. The idea for the video was actually taken from a sermon that he gave this year at his church. Chalke told HuffPost while tradition is important, the “traditional understanding of something isn’t always the right understanding of something.” Just as the church had to adjust its teachings to the realities of scientific discoveries of Galileo and Copernicus, he said it is crucial for Christians to use modern-day resources to re-examine these clobber passages. “Our poor understanding of the New Testament has brought misery, persecution, oppression and rejection to countless hundreds of thousands and millions of LGBT people,” Chalke said. “It’s time to apologize for the mistakes we’ve made and move on.” Listen to Rev. Canon Steve Chalke’s full presentation above. UPDATE : This article has been updated with comments from Rev. Canon Steve Chalke.",59.13,10.1,12.5,1043,1043,"chalke

It’s that positive response that Forrester said he hopes the world will see more of. “This should be a wake-up call for the country that we need to be better to each other,” he said. “This is a time when a guy like this should be brought to the top and the guy who did this, that’s all the news wants to talk about, but these victims are the ones we should be talking about now.” Dorene Anderson Dorene Anderson, 49, was attending the concert with her husband and two daughters when she was fatally wounded, local NBC affiliate KTUU reported .

Tom Smith, who identified Mestas as his cousin in a Facebook post, memorialized her as a “true and dedicated Christian” whose “generous smile was infectious.” “It brightly reflected the Glory of God like a beacon of joy. Heaven’s gain this day is our loss, though only temporarily,” Smith wrote. Kim Gervais, Mestas’ friend, was critically wounded. According to a GoFundMe page set up for Gervais, the grandmother from Southern California was shot in her spine, leaving her a quadriplegic. Erick Silva The 21-year-old was working on the music festival’s security detail when the first shots rang out. Instead of running away, he began helping others evacuate. “He was trying to help people get out,” Gina Argento, office manager for the Las Vegas branch of Contemporary Services Corp. security, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “He was in front of the stage. He was in front of everything.” Silva’s uncle, Rob Morgan, a motivational speaker who had been posting live videos from Las Vegas to Facebook before the shooting, posted another on Monday , showing him reduced to tears. “I’m with my family right now here in Vegas, live, from the house, of one of the victims ― my nephew,” Morgan says on the video. “He’s gone forever ... off the face of this earth,” Morgan says, pausing to choke back tears. “This is real life, this is what happens.” Silva’s stepsister, Daisy Hernandez, told CNN that Silva worked in security because he loved helping people. “He was a great son, brother, uncle who was loved by so many people,” Hernandez said. “He had just turned 21 this August and I’m pretty sure he died trying to protect people at that concert.” Carly Kreibaum The wife, and mother of two from Sutherland, Iowa, was attending the music festival with friends when she was shot amid chaos that separated from her companions, the Sioux City Journal reported. Her condition and whereabouts weren’t known until late Tuesday night, when her sister-in-law, Sarah Rohwer, confirmed her death to Sioux City station KTIV. Her husband, Chris Kreibaum, posted on Facebook earlier that day that he was on a plane heading to Las Vegas, “but we still don’t know anything at this time.” Though he never provided an update, news of his wife’s death spread and his Facebook post was flooded with condolences from friends, family and total strangers expressing heartbreak and prayers. Cameron Robinson The 27-year-old Utah resident was at the festival with his boyfriend when he was fatally shot in the neck, his stepmother, Trina Gray, told HuffPost. “I’ve been trying to block out [my emotions] because my daughter is flying to Vegas to handle everything,” Gray said through tears. “I called Cameron my bonus kid, not my stepkid. He called me his bonus mom.” Robinson died in the arms of his boyfriend, Robert, who is now living with survivor’s guilt, Gray said. During the festival, Robinson texted photos back to his stepmom joking that he and Robert wanted to have singer Sam Hunt’s children. “He was ― God, he was everything,” Gray said. “He went after everything he wanted and he got it. He was everything.” Gray said she last saw Robinson in January, when she went out to lunch with him and his boyfriend. The waiter told Robinson and Robert they made a “cute couple,” which sent Robinson over the moon, Gray said. “Cameron was so happy to go out in the world and be accepted,” she added. “That made him so happy.” Robinson’s 4-year-old nephew ― Gray’s grandson ― often video-chatted with him, and especially loved Robinson’s dog. One day, a package arrived for the boy with a stuffed dog inside from his uncle. Gray still has to reckon with telling her grandson the news. For now, when the boy asks why she’s crying, she tells him it’s because of her recently deceased mother. She doesn’t have to heart to tell him about Robinson. “I am trying to wake up from his nightmare,” Robinson’s sister, Meghan Ervin, wrote on Facebook. A GoFundMe account has been set up to help cover funeral costs. Gray could be heard holding back sobs before taking a deep breath and sighing. Then she asked a question many people must be asking themselves: “Who goes to a concert and gets killed?” CORRECTION: This piece previously indicated that Nick Robone was fatally wounded. UNLV has issued a statement saying he underwent surgery to remove the bullet from his chest and “ is expected to make a full recovery .”",71.85,7.3,10.2,6441,6441,"told

The quote is from Mandela’s autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom . Obama’s series of tweets also featured a photo of him greeting children at a day care facility in Bethesda, Maryland, in 2011. President Donald Trump mentioned Obama in his response to the Charlottesville protests, during which white supremacists and other fringe groups clashed with counter-protesters. “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides ― on many sides,” Trump said Saturday. “It’s been going on for a long time in our country, not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama. It’s been going on for a long, long time.” At least three people died in the Charlottesville area Saturday. A 32-year-old woman was killed after a car plowed into a group of anti-racist protesters. Two more people were killed in a helicopter crash near Charlottesville.

Cammack, who represents 23-year-old Charneisha Corley, told Houston’s Fox 26 News the video shows what amounts to an 11-minute “rape by cop” on June 21, 2015. An officer “body slammed Miss Corley, stuck her head underneath the vehicle and completely pulled her pants off, leaving her naked and exposed in that Texaco parking lot,” Cammack said. “They then took Miss Corley and placed both ankles behind her ears spread eagle position and started to search for something in Miss Corley’s cavity in her vaginal area.” “That was extreme, to pull my clothes down, in front of people,” Corley can be heard saying on the video after the search. “People were watching. You didn’t see people walking around?” Investigators alleged they found 0.02 ounces of marijuana on her, though Cammack said that there was no marijuana, the Houston Chronicle reported at the time. Corley was charged with resisting arrest and possession of marijuana, both misdemeanors, but the Harris County District Attorney’s Office later dropped the charges. Corley filed a multi-million dollar civil lawsuit against the Harris County Sheriff’s Office after the traffic stop. Two of the deputies involved the body cavity search were charged last year with official oppression. Those charges were dropped on Aug. 4, prompting Cammack to post the video on his website. “Once the community sees this video, they’re going to be outraged, disgusted,” Cammack told Houston’s KTRK-TV . The attorney did not return a request for comment from HuffPost on Tuesday. Corley, in a 2015 interview with HuffPost , said she was running an errand for her sick mother when deputies pulled her over and accused her of running a stop sign. The deputy said he smelled marijuana coming from the car, which in Texas is probable cause to search a vehicle. After a fruitless look inside the car, the lawman summoned a female deputy and events spiraled out of control, Corley said. “They sexually assaulted, raped me and molested me,” Corley told HuffPost. Harris County prosecutor Natasha Sinclair told FOX 26 News that she does not condone what happened. “No one in this office stands by the search the way it was conducted,” she said. “No one thinks it’s appropriate. It should not have happened.” However, Sinclair said the deputies actions did not amount to a criminal act. The civil suit is pending. Tips? Feedback?

Many prior winners, or as they’re called, “formers,” consider the pageant a wonderful, wholesome activity for young women. But Haskell’s behavior behind closed doors shows he regularly maligned, fat-shamed and slut-shamed the former Miss Americas, calling them shocking names and in one case laughing at the suggestion that one of the women should die. When it came to one particular former, Haskell took his efforts so far that she lost her pageant coaching business. Two Miss America board members served as a virtual rubber stamp for Haskell’s behavior: Tammy Haddad, a media consultant and D.C. power connector; and Lynn Weidner, a Las Vegas socialite. And though Friedman was never a board member, he regularly sent offensive and sexist messages to Haskell, which Haskell often responded to by indicating he thought Friedman was funny or endorsed what Friedman was saying. For this story, HuffPost reviewed nearly three years of internal emails provided by two sources. They reveal a CEO who regularly wrote and responded to unprofessional, offensive emails about the women who poured their hearts into the pageants and the organization he was leading. (Update: The board suspended Haskell on Friday, hours after an open letter from 49 former Miss Americas called for top-level resignations, adding, “The Board will be conducting an in-depth investigation into alleged inappropriate communications and the nature in which they were obtained. In addition, the Board wishes to reaffirm our commitment to the education and empowerment of young women, supporting them in every way possible.”) Improving A Struggling American Institution Sam Haskell joined Miss America’s board in 2005 after retiring from the William Morris Agency (now called WME), where he was the worldwide head of television. Most everyone agrees that to a certain extent, Haskell helped the organization get back on its feet. Miss America has returned to broadcast television, airing on ABC after being relegated to basic cable. It has also come back to its original home of Atlantic City, New Jersey, from Las Vegas, where the pageant took place in a smaller venue. In 2014, the Miss America Organization and Dick Clark Productions announced a one-year deal (later extended to three years) for the storied entertainment company to produce and cover the cost of the annual pageant telecast, in addition to paying a fee to the Miss America Organization for the rights to produce the telecast. As part of the deal, Dick Clark Productions received two seats on the Miss America Organization board. Over the past 12 years, Haskell has gone from a board member to a well-compensated CEO. He makes $500,000 a year, which has been a source of internal and external controversy . But despite his success at growing the pageant, internal emails show a different story. In some cases, Haskell was professional. In an August 2013 email exchange, one month before Mallory Hagan, 2013’s winner, would crown the new Miss America in Atlantic City, Haskell exchanged emails with his daughter and one of his top employees, Brent Adams, about Hagan. His daughter, Mary Lane, said, “Here’s hoping you get another good one!” Haskell replied to Mary Lane, “It’s going to be hard to replace Mallory, but I’m hopeful!” But in other cases, Haskell and Haddad routinely maligned the former Miss Americas, calling them “malcontents” and treating them as embarrassing inconveniences rather than honored alumnae. In May 2014, Haskell forwarded one of Haddad’s emails to a Miss America executive. In it, Haddad had referred to some former Miss Americas as a “pile of malcontents and has beens who blame the program for not getting them where they think they can go.” She added, “80% of the winners do not have the class, smarts and model for success.” She then encouraged Haskell to try to avoid getting riled up by the “formers,” saying, “YOU have to let them go. You don’t need them. They need you. We also have to punish them when they don’t appreciate what we do for them.” In his forward, Haskell called the advice wise. In response to email questions sent to Haskell and Haddad, HuffPost received a response from a Miss America Organization spokesman. He said Friedman had been let go from the organization after an investigation. “The Miss America Organization Board of Directors was notified about the concern of inappropriate language in email communications several months ago. Consequently, the organization’s Board of Directors took the allegations of inappropriate comments very seriously and formed an investigative committee,” he wrote. “As a result of the investigation, the Board directed the organization terminate the relationship with most egregious author of inappropriate comments. In addition, the Board has started the process of instituting additional policies and procedures for communication.” “The Board has full confidence in the Miss America Organization leadership team,” he added. In a reply to an email with questions about his statements, Friedman said, “Before commenting to correct your information and provide context, I’ll speak to my attorney as this matter is the subject of pending litigation.” It is not clear what litigation he was referencing. ‘It Should Have Been Kate Shindle’ Haskell sometimes focused on Kate Shindle, who was crowned in 1998. The former Miss Illinois is now a successful actor and singer, and serves as president of the Actors’ Equity Association, the union representing more than 51,000 American stage actors and stage managers. In 2014, Shindle released a book in which she questioned the Miss America board’s decision to pay Haskell a $500,000 consulting fee, during a year the organization was over $400,000 in the red. (The board said the money was back-pay for Haskell.) Shindle was not revealing new information; press accounts had already exposed the payment. In her book, she also alleged Haskell blacklisted those who dissented against his leadership, with the national organization calling state-level pageants and giving those groups names of people they could not associate with. In December 2014, Friedman emailed Haskell to offer his condolences on the death of former Miss America Mary Ann Mobley, writing, “So sorry to hear about Mary Ann Mobley” The subject line of Friedman’s email read: “It should have been Kate Shindle.” Haskell replied, “Thanks so much Coach...even in my sadness you can make me laugh...how was the Kennedy Center Honors? Love you and appreciate you! Sam.” Shindle declined to comment for this article. ‘Drive Gretchen Insane’ Haskell and Haddad also appeared to dislike Gretchen Carlson, who won the Miss America title in 1989 and was on the organization’s board of directors for many years. The root cause of their disdain, according to three sources, was Carlson’s push to modernize the organization and her refusal to attack former Miss Americas. Haskell told Carlson not to have Hagan on her program, according to three sources familiar with the conversation. Carlson refused. On Aug. 15, 2014, Weidner sent an email to a group of former Miss Americas, including Carlson, about Shindle’s book, saying, “Is it possible for each of you to speak out in defense of Sam and the organization?” Carlson replied, “It’s one thing to talk about your own personal experience as Miss America … but totally different to attack people individually.” Haskell forwarded Carlson’s response to Haddad, who replied to Haskell, “Snake but now u have not doubts as to her loyalty. Makes it easy not to respond. Right?” Just before Shindle’s book came out, Haddad emailed Haskell and said, “Why don’t u read susan POWELL’s [former Miss America] email on the board call and say it’s a shame that only one miss america who has come forward to offer help in any way.” Haddad was referring to an email Powell had written that was supportive of Haskell. Haskell replied, “Brilliant…..fucking Brilliant!!!! That will drive Gretchen INFUCKINGSANE.” After the email exchange, Haskell did not feature Carlson in the next Miss America broadcast ― an unusual decision given her prominence. In a statement sent by email, Haddad said, “I have the highest regard and gratitude for Gretchen and her extraordinary leadership in fighting for women.” Carlson later resigned from the Miss America board. Haskell and other board members were telling people Carlson couldn’t be trusted, which she felt was maligning her integrity, according to a source familiar with her thinking at the time. Carlson responded to HuffPost on Thursday, “As a proud former Miss America and former member of the Board of the Miss America Organization, I am shocked and deeply saddened by the disgusting statements about women attributed to the leadership of the MAO. No woman should be demeaned with such vulgar slurs. As I’ve learned, harassment and shaming of women is never acceptable and should never be tolerated. Every MAO executive and board member who engaged in such crude behavior and signed off on it like it was no big deal should resign immediately. The Miss America Organization, which is tasked to uphold an almost 100 year old tradition of female empowerment and scholarship, deserves better. I hope all former Miss Americas, state and local titleholders and volunteers will join me in a collective effort to fight for the dignity of this great institution.” In 2016, Carlson rocked the media world when she sued former Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes for sexual harassment. Carlson’s suit led to Ailes being pushed out, and she later received a settlement. She has since focused on bringing attention to the epidemic of sexual harassment in the workplace and is working with members of Congress to approve legislation to protect women’s rights in the workplace. Focused Attacks Haskell also appeared to have special disdain for Hagan. In January 2013, she was crowned Miss America at the pageant in Las Vegas. But just three months later, she was publicly fat-shamed for a bikini photo that surfaced. Haskell said nothing publicly about the images at the time. Later, though, he did internally. As the reigning champion, Hagan spent time in Oxford, Mississippi, at Haskell and his wife’s home. It was there Hagan got to know Adams, whose official title was director of development at Haskell’s production company, which had a television deal with Warner Brothers. Adams essentially acted as a chief of staff, overseeing the various elements of Haskell’s business and personal life, including Miss America. Adams and Hagan realized they had a connection after spending time together, but, fearful that professional entanglements could complicate a romantic relationship, the two decided if they were going to date it would be best to wait until Hagan’s reign was over. Shortly after Hagan crowned the new Miss America in September 2013, she and Adams started dating. According to Adams, Haskell wanted Adams to date his daughter, not Hagan, and was open about this request. Adams recalled an encounter with Haskell at his home in which Haskell attempted to convince Adams to break up with Hagan and instead date his daughter. Haskell stretched out his arms and told Adams, “All of this can be yours,” ostensibly referring to his Oxford mansion and the family’s money. “You don’t need a piece of trash like Mallory. You need someone with class and money like my daughter,” he said, according to Adams. When Adams was in New York with the Haskell family, Haskell accidentally sent a text message to a group chat that suggested his daughter try to hold Adams’ hand. Adams described the text in a phone interview. Once, when Hagan made a payment for dinner to Adams via the peer-to-peer payment app Venmo (which shows payments between friends), Haskell confronted Adams about it, asking why he was still in touch with Hagan. ‘Are We Four The Only Ones Not To Have Fucked Mallory?’ In August 2014, Haskell received an email from someone he knew, who said Hagan’s hairdresser in New York had been commenting on Hagan’s sex life while Hagan was living in Los Angeles, as well as her recent weight gain. Haskell forwarded the email to Friedman saying, “ Not a single day passes that I am not told some horrible story about Mallory.” Friedman replied, “ Mallory’s preparing for her new career … as a blimp in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade As she continues to destroy her own credibility, her voice will attract less and less notice while she continues her descent to an unhappy pathetic footnote.” Friedman ended the email with, “Ps. Are we four the only ones not to have fucked Mallory?” Haskell replied and said, “It appears we are the only ones!” He then wrote Hagan had slept with someone he knew, and he told the man’s mother “he needs to have a blood test because we lost count of the number of men she slept with at 25.” A source close to Hagan says the accusations about her hairdresser and having sex with the man in question are not true. ′ Why Does He Want That ?′ On Jan. 25, 2015, Weidner sent Haskell a photo of Hagan with three other former Miss Americas. Weidner did not comment on the photo in her email. Haskell replied, saying, “OMG she is huge...and gross...why does he want that?????” Haskell did not name Adams specifically, but it appears he was discussing his employee, who was still dating Hagan at the time. Haskell then forwarded the email to Josh Randle, who now serves as president of the Miss America Organization, and added, “Look at MH in this photo...OMG...Why does he want that?” Randle said, “She’s a healthy one!! Hahaha.” Haskill said, “Look at this photo from the Former Retreat!!! Shindle was there too and I was told she made everyone sign an NDA as she rolled out her plan of attack...evil lurks.” Haddad said, “Mallory is barely recognizable” Haskell said, “It is unreal.” Haddad replied, and said, in part, “U think he left u for that? Don’t believe it. It makes NO sense.” Haskell also forwarded the email to Friedman, who said, “My screen just cracked! What happened?” Hagan declined to comment for this article. A Miss America Organization spokesman replied to questions sent to Randle with the same statement he gave for Haskell and Haddad. That statement said Friedman had been let go and the board was instituting new guidelines for internal communication. Consequences For Hagan At the end of December 2015, emails suggest Haskell felt Hagan was personally maligning him. In an email to Haddad, Weidner and Randle, among others, Haskell asked for help, saying Hagan was “viciously and cruelly” attacking him and his family “every day.” It’s unclear what Hagan was doing or saying at the time, but a comb of her social media posts doesn’t reveal anything egregious. She continued to be critical of Haskell’s leadership and the direction of the organization, but not in a way that would warrant what was suggested next by Haddad in response to Haskell’s urgent plea. Haddad said, “Hi. I am so sorry. It is ridiculous but she is not going to stop. She has no control. I think u should hire an investigator to get something on her.” (A source close to Haddad said she was not suggesting in the email that Haskell hire an investigator to dig up something of a personal nature on Hagan. Rather, her intention was to suggest Haskell hire an investigator to see if Hagan had been posting messages anonymously on internal Miss America message boards.) Haskell said, “Thoughts on Tammy’s note below? Threatening her won’t work and we already have ‘enough info on her’ to shut down Ft. Knox.....ugh. I really think the best way is to shut down her social media, and convince the Formers to ostracize her” Weidner said, “I wish I had an easy answer to this dilemma. If we can prove a direct connection between MH and specific instances of cyber bullying, we could at least threaten her with a lawsuit right? I do believe that our anti coaching initiatives are already impacting her business. And that our policy of ignoring her is driving her crazy!” “I pray none of you ever experience anything like this....It is finally clear that I am on my own,” Haskell replied. In response to list of questions sent via email, specifically if it was appropriate for nonprofit resources to be used to investigate former Miss Americas, Haddad said in an email, “ This was a terrible, highly divisive time in the Miss America Organization, fueled by inflammatory character attacks. I along with the Board worked to stop the damage that was being inflicted on the organization and members of its community.” In a statement, Weidner called Haskell “ one of the most outstanding individuals I have ever had the pleasure of knowing.” “Sam had led us to becoming a nationally recognized and positive force for the education and the empowerment of young women,” she wrote. “The fact that he would be so ruthlessly attacked by a handful of disgruntled malcontents is disgraceful. I am very proud of the way he has kept above the fray and always conducted himself in a way that does honor to this program.” Opportunities Lost After winning the pageant, Hagan signed with a WME agent in Los Angeles, Lee White, whom Haskell introduced her to. But within months, a source close to Hagan says White started to withdraw and decline requests to meet with her. In one email from White to Haskell described verbally by a source, White suggests he shouldn’t have drinks with Hagan based on something Haskell told him. Haskell replies, saying White made the right judgment. A few months later, Hagan dropped White as her agent. She moved back to New York and joined a friend training contestants for the all-important interview portion of the pageant. But within months, the national Miss America Organization told contestants they couldn’t have coaches ― specifically, interview coaches. The national organization also said that anyone wanting to use a coach would have to seek approval from the executive director of their local organization. The national organization had an informal list of coaches contestants couldn’t use, which contestants found out about through their local and state pageant directors. Hagan was on the list. Soon after, Hagan’s lucrative coaching business fell apart. In August 2016, Hagan moved back home to Alabama, where she had to rebuild her career. Today, she is the evening anchor of a small NBC affiliate in Columbus, Georgia. Cease And Desist In August 2017, Adams and a former Miss America board member, Regina Hopper, flew to Los Angeles to talk to Dick Clark Productions about Haskell’s behavior. They had copies of egregious emails from Haskell, some of which are included in this article. The duo expected that Dick Clark Productions, a large entertainment company, would be horrified by the messages. In the meeting, Amy Thurlow and Mark Bracco, both executives at Dick Clark Productions who held the two Miss America board seats, thanked Hopper and Adams for providing the emails and told them Dick Clark Productions would conduct its own investigation. A month later, Adams received a cease-and-desist letter from a law firm representing the Miss America Organization. It read, “Your deliberate actions constitute a clear violation of the Non-disclosure Agreement you knowingly and willfully entered into….the letter directed to the Chairman of the Board from Dick Clark Productions, dated September 13, 2017, noticed us of your illegal disclosure of information, which includes several internal email communications.” The two Dick Clark executives presented the emails to the board, hoping it would lead to a change in leadership, according to two well-placed sources who are familiar with the executives’ thinking at the time. But, the sources said, no change took place. In fact, last September, knowing full well the kind of language Friedman used in his emails about former Miss Americas, the board allowed him to continue to write for the Miss America pageant telecast. Based on the board’s refusal to take action in response to the disturbing emails, Dick Clark Productions decided to end its agreement with the Miss America Organization, the sources said. Several prominent Miss America supporters were stunned at the news. The agreement was a lifeline to Miss America ― the production company covered the costs of producing the telecast; paid the Miss America Organization a fee as part of the agreement; and featured, among other things, the current Miss America on the various awards telecasts it produces, like the Billboard Awards. In a statement Thursday to HuffPost, Dick Clark Productions explained its decision: “Several months ago, dick clark productions was made aware of a portion of the emails that were referenced in the December 21 Huffington Post article. We were appalled by their unacceptable content and insisted, in the strongest possible terms, that the Miss America Organization (MAO) board of directors conduct a comprehensive investigation and take appropriate action to address the situation. Shortly thereafter, we resigned our board positions and notified MAO that we were terminating our relationship with them.” The same prominent Miss America supporters said they found it unfathomable that the board would side with Haskell and Friedman over Dick Clark Productions. ‘These Young Women Put Their Heart And Soul Into Being the Best They Can Be’ Unsurprisingly, the email that angered the people who spoke to HuffPost for this article the most was the one referring to former Miss Americas as “cunts.” In particular, sources found it offensive that Haskell appeared to think that was funny. Hopper recounted how she reacted to the email by sharing what she experienced at the last Miss Arkansas pageant, when the reigning Miss America Savvy Shields, who is from the state, made an appearance. “I sat in the audience and watched her [Miss America] walk out on stage, and the young women and those in the audience all wanted to see and hear her. And that email floated into my head, and tears started running down my face,” she said. “Across this country, there are parents who are sitting in audiences who put their young daughters into this system with the trust that they’re going to walk away from participating with something good. These young women put their heart and soul into being the best they can be. That the CEO of this organization would agree that word is the perfect characterization of Miss Americas and then laugh ― it’s heartbreaking.” This article has been updated with Haskell’s suspension Friday.

line","In late August 2014, the CEO of the Miss America Organization, Sam Haskell, sent an email to the lead writer of the Miss America pageant telecast, Lewis Friedman, informing him of a change he wanted to make in the script: “I have decided that when referring to a woman who was once Miss America, we are no longer going to call them Forever Miss Americas....please change all script copy to reflect that they are Former Miss Americas!” Friedman replied, “I’d already changed “Forevers” to “Cunts.” Does that work for you?” Haskell’s short reply came quickly: “Perfect...bahahaha.” At that point, Haskell had been the leader of Miss America for nine years, after rising through the ranks at a top Hollywood talent agency.
But Haskell’s behavior behind closed doors shows he regularly maligned, fat-shamed and slut-shamed the former Miss Americas, calling them shocking names and in one case laughing at the suggestion that one of the women should die.
Two Miss America board members served as a virtual rubber stamp for Haskell’s behavior: Tammy Haddad, a media consultant and D.C. power connector; and Lynn Weidner, a Las Vegas socialite.
They reveal a CEO who regularly wrote and responded to unprofessional, offensive emails about the women who poured their hearts into the pageants and the organization he was leading.
(Update: The board suspended Haskell on Friday, hours after an open letter from 49 former Miss Americas called for top-level resignations, adding, “The Board will be conducting an in-depth investigation into alleged inappropriate communications and the nature in which they were obtained.
In addition, the Board wishes to reaffirm our commitment to the education and empowerment of young women, supporting them in every way possible.”) Improving A Struggling American Institution Sam Haskell joined Miss America’s board in 2005 after retiring from the William Morris Agency (now called WME), where he was the worldwide head of television.
In 2014, the Miss America Organization and Dick Clark Productions announced a one-year deal (later extended to three years) for the storied entertainment company to produce and cover the cost of the annual pageant telecast, in addition to paying a fee to the Miss America Organization for the rights to produce the telecast.
As part of the deal, Dick Clark Productions received two seats on the Miss America Organization board.
In an August 2013 email exchange, one month before Mallory Hagan, 2013’s winner, would crown the new Miss America in Atlantic City, Haskell exchanged emails with his daughter and one of his top employees, Brent Adams, about Hagan.
His daughter, Mary Lane, said, “Here’s hoping you get another good one!” Haskell replied to Mary Lane, “It’s going to be hard to replace Mallory, but I’m hopeful!” But in other cases, Haskell and Haddad routinely maligned the former Miss Americas, calling them “malcontents” and treating them as embarrassing inconveniences rather than honored alumnae.
In it, Haddad had referred to some former Miss Americas as a “pile of malcontents and has beens who blame the program for not getting them where they think they can go.” She added, “80% of the winners do not have the class, smarts and model for success.” She then encouraged Haskell to try to avoid getting riled up by the “formers,” saying, “YOU have to let them go.
In response to email questions sent to Haskell and Haddad, HuffPost received a response from a Miss America Organization spokesman.
“The Miss America Organization Board of Directors was notified about the concern of inappropriate language in email communications several months ago.
In 2014, Shindle released a book in which she questioned the Miss America board’s decision to pay Haskell a $500,000 consulting fee, during a year the organization was over $400,000 in the red.
In December 2014, Friedman emailed Haskell to offer his condolences on the death of former Miss America Mary Ann Mobley, writing, “So sorry to hear about Mary Ann Mobley” The subject line of Friedman’s email read: “It should have been Kate Shindle.” Haskell replied, “Thanks so much Coach...even in my sadness you can make me laugh...how was the Kennedy Center Honors?
‘Drive Gretchen Insane’ Haskell and Haddad also appeared to dislike Gretchen Carlson, who won the Miss America title in 1989 and was on the organization’s board of directors for many years.
The root cause of their disdain, according to three sources, was Carlson’s push to modernize the organization and her refusal to attack former Miss Americas.
On Aug. 15, 2014, Weidner sent an email to a group of former Miss Americas, including Carlson, about Shindle’s book, saying, “Is it possible for each of you to speak out in defense of Sam and the organization?” Carlson replied, “It’s one thing to talk about your own personal experience as Miss America … but totally different to attack people individually.” Haskell forwarded Carlson’s response to Haddad, who replied to Haskell, “Snake but now u have not doubts as to her loyalty.
Right?” Just before Shindle’s book came out, Haddad emailed Haskell and said, “Why don’t u read susan POWELL’s [former Miss America] email on the board call and say it’s a shame that only one miss america who has come forward to offer help in any way.” Haddad was referring to an email Powell had written that was supportive of Haskell.
In a statement sent by email, Haddad said, “I have the highest regard and gratitude for Gretchen and her extraordinary leadership in fighting for women.” Carlson later resigned from the Miss America board.
Haskell and other board members were telling people Carlson couldn’t be trusted, which she felt was maligning her integrity, according to a source familiar with her thinking at the time.
Carlson responded to HuffPost on Thursday, “As a proud former Miss America and former member of the Board of the Miss America Organization, I am shocked and deeply saddened by the disgusting statements about women attributed to the leadership of the MAO.
Shortly after Hagan crowned the new Miss America in September 2013, she and Adams started dating.
‘Are We Four The Only Ones Not To Have Fucked Mallory?’ In August 2014, Haskell received an email from someone he knew, who said Hagan’s hairdresser in New York had been commenting on Hagan’s sex life while Hagan was living in Los Angeles, as well as her recent weight gain.
Haskell forwarded the email to Friedman saying, “ Not a single day passes that I am not told some horrible story about Mallory.” Friedman replied, “ Mallory’s preparing for her new career … as a blimp in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade As she continues to destroy her own credibility, her voice will attract less and less notice while she continues her descent to an unhappy pathetic footnote.” Friedman ended the email with, “Ps. Are we four the only ones not to have fucked Mallory?” Haskell replied and said, “It appears we are the only ones!” He then wrote Hagan had slept with someone he knew, and he told the man’s mother “he needs to have a blood test because we lost count of the number of men she slept with at 25.” A source close to Hagan says the accusations about her hairdresser and having sex with the man in question are not true.
′ Why Does He Want That ?′ On Jan. 25, 2015, Weidner sent Haskell a photo of Hagan with three other former Miss Americas.
Haskell replied, saying, “OMG she is huge...and gross...why does he want that?????” Haskell did not name Adams specifically, but it appears he was discussing his employee, who was still dating Hagan at the time.
Haskell then forwarded the email to Josh Randle, who now serves as president of the Miss America Organization, and added, “Look at MH in this photo...OMG...Why does he want that?” Randle said, “She’s a healthy one!!
A Miss America Organization spokesman replied to questions sent to Randle with the same statement he gave for Haskell and Haddad.
That statement said Friedman had been let go and the board was instituting new guidelines for internal communication.
In an email to Haddad, Weidner and Randle, among others, Haskell asked for help, saying Hagan was “viciously and cruelly” attacking him and his family “every day.” It’s unclear what Hagan was doing or saying at the time, but a comb of her social media posts doesn’t reveal anything egregious.
I think u should hire an investigator to get something on her.” (A source close to Haddad said she was not suggesting in the email that Haskell hire an investigator to dig up something of a personal nature on Hagan.
Rather, her intention was to suggest Haskell hire an investigator to see if Hagan had been posting messages anonymously on internal Miss America message boards.) Haskell said, “Thoughts on Tammy’s note below?
In response to list of questions sent via email, specifically if it was appropriate for nonprofit resources to be used to investigate former Miss Americas, Haddad said in an email, “ This was a terrible, highly divisive time in the Miss America Organization, fueled by inflammatory character attacks.
I along with the Board worked to stop the damage that was being inflicted on the organization and members of its community.” In a statement, Weidner called Haskell “ one of the most outstanding individuals I have ever had the pleasure of knowing.” “Sam had led us to becoming a nationally recognized and positive force for the education and the empowerment of young women,” she wrote.
But within months, the national Miss America Organization told contestants they couldn’t have coaches ― specifically, interview coaches.
Cease And Desist In August 2017, Adams and a former Miss America board member, Regina Hopper, flew to Los Angeles to talk to Dick Clark Productions about Haskell’s behavior.
In the meeting, Amy Thurlow and Mark Bracco, both executives at Dick Clark Productions who held the two Miss America board seats, thanked Hopper and Adams for providing the emails and told them Dick Clark Productions would conduct its own investigation.
A month later, Adams received a cease-and-desist letter from a law firm representing the Miss America Organization.
Based on the board’s refusal to take action in response to the disturbing emails, Dick Clark Productions decided to end its agreement with the Miss America Organization, the sources said.
Shortly thereafter, we resigned our board positions and notified MAO that we were terminating our relationship with them.” The same prominent Miss America supporters said they found it unfathomable that the board would side with Haskell and Friedman over Dick Clark Productions.
‘These Young Women Put Their Heart And Soul Into Being the Best They Can Be’ Unsurprisingly, the email that angered the people who spoke to HuffPost for this article the most was the one referring to former Miss Americas as “cunts.” In particular, sources found it offensive that Haskell appeared to think that was funny."

During an appearance on MSNBC, Carmen Yulin Cruz reiterated that Puerto Rico needed more help and said her previous critiques of the administration’s response had not been intended as a personal slight. “Actually, I was asking for help,” she said. “I wasn’t saying anything nasty about the president.” “I will continue to do whatever I need to do, say whatever I need to say, compliment the people I need to compliment, and call out the people that I need to call out,” she added. “This isn’t about me. This isn’t about anyone. This is about lives that are being lost if things do not get done properly real quickly.” Trump had tweeted criticisms of Cruz earlier in the day, saying she demonstrated “poor leadership ability.” “The Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump,” he wrote. “They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort,” Trump added, noting how there were now 10,000 federal workers on the “totally destroyed” island who were “doing a fantastic job.” Trump also criticized CNN and NBC for their coverage of the relief effort. He tweeted again on Saturday afternoon, claiming the media was misrepresenting aid work taking place in Puerto Rico. The president’s posts were an apparent reaction to the criticism that Cruz has leveled at his administration in recent days over its handling of the fallout from the natural disaster, which has claimed at least 16 lives since ripping through the island more than a week ago. Elaine Duke, the acting secretary of homeland security, on Thursday enthusiastically praised how federal authorities had reacted to the aftermath of the storm. “ I know it’s a hard storm to recover from ,” she said. “But I know it is really a good news story in terms of our ability to reach people and the limited number of deaths that have taken place in such a devastating hurricane.” Cruz, however, called that statement “irresponsible.” “ This is a people are dying story . This is a life or death story,” she said on Friday’s broadcast of CNN’s “New Day.” “This is a story of a devastation that continues to worsen because people are not getting food and water.” Cruz also used a news conference at a distribution center on Friday to blast the response and ask Trump to step up efforts to get aid delivered to islanders in need. “ We are dying here, and I cannot fathom the thought that the greatest nation in the world cannot figure out logistics for a small island of 100 miles by 35 miles,” she said. “Mayday! We are in trouble.” She has responded to Trump’s tweets by saying that the one goal was “saving lives.” Critics have also called out Trump for devoting so much time to attacking NFL players who take a knee during the national anthem as the relief effort was struggling to get under way. Trump said Saturday that he would visit Puerto Rico with first lady Melania Trump on Tuesday. This article has been updated with comments Cruz made Saturday morning.",59.13,10.1,12.4,573,573,"trump

A deft, 25-minute weaving of carefully curated sound bites, screenshots of news reports, slick maps and graphics, all strung together to make the case that something fishy is afoot. It’s a style Maddow has perfected, and it has propelled her to the top of the ratings heap. There was just one problem. Maddow’s theory was so flimsy that it could be debunked by a quick glance at a map, let alone a phone call with an expert. Janet Malcolm of The New Yorker recently described Maddow’s show as “a piece of sleight of hand presented as a cable news show. It is TV entertainment at its finest. It permits liberals to enjoy themselves during what may be the most thoroughly unenjoyable time of their political lives.” Thursday night’s entertainment came as an attempt to pin the ambush that killed four Green Berets in Niger earlier this month on President Donald Trump’s newest proposed travel ban , which was scheduled to go into effect this week but was struck down in federal court. Maddow seized on the revised ban’s inclusion of Chad, one of Niger’s neighbors and a U.S. partner in counterterrorism efforts in Africa. An expert, Maddow noted, warned that the decision “could put Americans in harm’s way.” Last week, when the Chadian government announced that it had completed the two-week process of pulling out all of its troops from Niger, the move was viewed as related to the travel ban, she claimed. An uptick in extremist attacks has ensued, Maddow added, which “might explain why we have just had these four absolutely unbelievable gut-wrenching emotional days in American politics and in D.C. in particular.” Maddow’s segment was designed to strongly suggest, without outright stating, that Trump’s addition of Chad in his latest travel ban prompted the country to remove its troops from Niger, leading to an increase in extremist attacks and ultimately claiming the lives of four U.S. soldiers. Chad’s pullout from Niger “had an immediate effect in emboldening ISIS attacks,” Maddow said. That appears to be false. According to the Council on Foreign Relations and accounts from local residents , the attacks that have increased can be traced back to militant group Boko Haram , which is based just across the border in Nigeria. A group of Boko Haram militants broke away and formed the Islamic State West Africa, Laura Seay, an assistant professor in Colby College’s Department of Government, told HuffPost. But they are separate from the so-called Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, the group that reportedly carried out the ambush (although no group has claimed responsibility for the attack). Chadian troops were present in Niger specifically to ward off the Boko Haram threat ― they had nothing to do with Islamic State in the Greater Sahara. They were also based almost 800 miles away, in an area called Diffa that’s long been battling the group, Seay said. Any expert asked about Chadian troops battling ISIS in Niger would have said “No, that’s crazy,” Seay added. ”Everybody that I know is appalled by this. I would like to think that Maddow’s researchers are more responsible.” Plus, the pullout of Chadian troops isn’t necessarily related to the travel ban, as Maddow implied. “It may have already been planned and [the travel ban] was the straw that broke the camel’s back,” Seay said. “Chadians didn’t want to keep their forces there forever and were at least looking to scale down. If we do see the travel ban lifted I’m not sure you’d see the Chadians go back in.” Maddow quoted a colonel who said the ambush was “not expected.” But an attack of this nature was “almost inevitable,” Seay added, seeing as American special forces teams are operating in remote areas in an “advise-and-assist” capacity, training military personnel across the region. Army Green Berets, for example, have gone to the Mali-Niger border 29 times in the last six months. And even though they’re technically in an advisory capacity, it’s not uncommon for these troops to end up in the line of fire, she noted. “They go on patrol with local military so they’re technically not fighting. But really they’re right there together.” “There has been an increase of violence in this area and nearby areas for more than a year, and the overall security situation has been getting worse,” said Andrew Lebovich, a visiting fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations. The Rachel Maddow Show declined to comment to HuffPost. The Trump era has been a boon for the Rachel Maddow Show. It was the highest rated cable news program in total viewers and the coveted age 25-54 demographic in the most recent quarter this year. “By reducing the story to its mythic fundamentals,” Janet Malcolm wrote earlier this month, “Maddow creates the illusion of completeness that novels and short stories create. We feel that this is the story as we listen to and watch her tell it.” It’s a tactic that right-wing hosts like Sean Hannity and Alex Jones have perfected, building myths using unrelated or unreliable information in ways that brought us the birther lie and the Benghazi controversy, putting the country on a path to fake news and the Trump presidency. On Thursday , Maddow reduced the story so thoroughly that it lost any semblance of the larger truth. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article stated that Maddow referred to the ambush as “absolutely baffling.” Since she was actually referring to the removal of Chadian troops, that has since been removed.",59.13,10.1,12,921,921,"maddow

Why? She’s getting booed while attending her best friend’s wedding. Amid one of the craziest weeks of her career, the pop star took a break from stirring internet frenzy to be a bridesmaid at the wedding of high school bestie Abigail Anderson. For those who haven’t dedicated every waking moment to deciphering Swift’s lyrics, Abigail is the redheaded girl she sings about in “Fifteen.” Remember? The one who “gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind.” Well, hopefully Swift left that part out of her bridesmaid’s speech, but she did look ever-dutiful on Saturday carrying Anderson’s veil before entering Old Whaling Church in Edgartown, Martha’s Vineyard. Dressing very much like the old Taylor, the “Ready For It” singer wore a maroon floor-length halter gown with a sweetheart neckline. She paired the look with a bold red lip and a pendant necklace. Given how everything Swift does these days is shrouded in secrecy, of course, die-hard Swifties jumped at the opportunity to catch a glimpse of their idol, and waited all afternoon. But when their moment of glory came, bodyguards erected a makeshift screen to shield Swift from her adoring public and some paparazzi, as she exited the church and hopped in an SUV. That’s when the crowd’s temperament soured and the booing began. “Taylor, we love you!” someone shouted. “We thought you loved your fans!” “Very disappointing, not cool,” another fan chimed in. Can we all just give the girl a break? Watch the video above. Correction : This story previously stated that it was raining the day of the wedding, but, according to weather reports, it wasn’t.

The night was still young, so he invited her over to his house to drink wine and watch a documentary about Scientology , he wrote on a GoFundMe page. At some point, the unidentified woman asked to use his bathroom. When she returned, Smyth said, she had “ a panicked look in her eye.” Smyth said the woman told him: “I went for a poo in your toilet, and it would not flush.” He then claims the woman confessed to reaching into the toilet bowl, wrapping the dookie in tissue paper and throwing it out of the window. Wanting to be a gentleman, Smyth suggested going outside together, bagging up the offending poo, throwing it away and then pretending “the whole sorry affair had never happened,” he recalled. Unfortunately, the story gets crappier. Smyth’s bathroom window doesn’t open to the garden, but into an 18-inch gap that is separated from the outside world by another non-opening double glazed window. “It was into this twilight zone that my date had thrown her poo,” he wrote. According to Smyth, when he went to get a hammer to smash the window, his date decided to climb in headfirst to retrieve the poop herself ― which she was able to do successfully. That’s when they realized she was stuck upside-down. “I grabbed her waist and I pulled. But she was stuck. Stuck fast,” Smyth wrote on his GoFundMe page. “Try as we might, we could not remove her from the window. She was stuck fast, upside down in the gap.” At that point, he called for help and an emergency crew drove up within minutes. About 15 minutes later, the woman was free. This story might not seem to pass the, er, sniff test at first glance. However, Avon Fire And Rescue, the fire company that rescued the young woman, confirmed to the Bristol Post that they responded to a call from Smyth’s address , where they rescued a woman “trapped between interior and exterior glass.” Firefighter Chris Crothers said when he and another rescue worker arrived, he saw that the woman was “ well and truly stuck” with her face squashed against the glass, according to a release on Avon Fire And Rescue’s website . “We often find when people are stuck they can start to panic very quickly so we do our best to keep them calm until we can free them,” Crothers said in the release. “I started chatting to her and she told the whole story about how she had become stuck. “She was quite open about the whole thing – I think by then she had gone passed [sic] the point of embarrassment!” Firefighters freed the woman from her glass prison by removing beading around the edge of the window glazing. Then they carefully removed her and lowered her to her feet. “Although she had been upside down for some time, with the company of a few spiders, she was absolutely fine and just pleased to be free,” Crothers said. “We see strange things all the time, but this certainly has to be one of the strangest – purely because of why she was stuck.” The fire department also tweeted a photo of the rescue, linking to Smyth’s GoFundMe page: To get her out, rescue workers had to break Smyth’s window. A replacement will cost $390 ― the same as his monthly budget ― hence the GoFundMe campaign. It seems that many people sympathize with the situation. Smyth has already received more than $2,700 in donations. He promises to donate anything beyond the cost of replacing the window to two charities. One of them benefits firefighters, while the other, Toilet Twinning , builds and maintains flushing toilets in the developing world. Although their first date ended up stinking to high heaven, it hasn’t swayed Smyth off a potential future with his lady friend. “ She’s a lovely girl ― I’m not sure what’s going to happen ― I’m really busy with my dissertation at the moment, but I’d certainly be open to seeing her again,” he told the Daily Star.",69.21,8.3,9.8,701,701,"smyth

After facing criticism from an Instagram user, Linton, who is married to the man who is fifth in the presidential line of succession, responded to the user with a long comment filled with classist attacks. Linton has now taken her Instagram account private, not allowing Instagram users who don’t already follow her to see her account. In the now-deleted post, Linton and Mnuchin are photographed deplaning the military jet (according to Linton’s Instagram post, they were landing in Kentucky), which Mnuchin is required to use for official government travel. The caption on her Instagram post read: “Great #daytrip to #Kentucky! #nicest #people #beautiful #countryside #rolandmouret pants #tomford sunnies, #hermesscarf #valentinorockstudheels #valentino #usa” Linton has tagged designers she appears to be wearing in previous Instagram posts, but it’s unusual, if not unprecedented, for the spouse of a Cabinet secretary to promote the designers she is wearing in any social media post, much less one that includes a photograph of herself with her husband while on government travel. An Instagram user, called “Jenni M,” responded to Linton’s post and said, “Glad we could pay for your little getaway. #deplorable” Linton’s response to Jenni M came after she appeared to examine Jenni M’s Instagram feed, making note of Jenni M’s family and children. “@Jennimiller29 cute!....Aw!! Did you think this was a personal trip?! Adorable! Do you think the US govt paid for our honeymoon or personal travel?! Lololol. Have you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self sacrifice to your country? I’m pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day “trip” than you did. Pretty sure the amount we sacrifice per year is a lot more than you’d be willing to sacrifice if the choice was yours. You’re adorably out of touch. Thanks for the passive aggressive nasty comment. Your kids look very cute. Your life looks cute. I know you’re mad but deep down you’re really nice and so am I. Sending me passive aggressive Instagram comments isn’t going to make life feel better. Maybe a nice message, one filled with wisdom and hunanity [SIC] would get more traction. Have a pleasant evening. Go chill out and watch the new game of thrones. It’s fab!” Linton on Tuesday released a statement apologizing for her “inappropriate and highly insensitive” Instagram post and her response to Jenni M, according to CNN reporter Jeremy Diamond. Linton’s Instagram post comes at a time when her husband is under attack by some of President Donald Trump’s loyalists for his lack of populist credentials. Linton’s out-of-touch post isn’t likely to help Mnuchin, the former Goldman Sachs executive who served as the finance chair of Trump’s presidential campaign. A spokesman for Mnuchin did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Instagram user that Linton attacked also did not respond to a message asking for comment. This is not Linton’s first encounter with controversy. In 2016, Linton came under fire for her self-published memoir, In Congo’s Shadow , which detailed her time as a student in Zambia. In July of 2016, Zambians, and their advocates, criticized Linton’s portrayal of Zambia as a war-torn, poverty-stricken nation with wild animals running through the streets. Linton was also criticized for portraying herself as a white savior. Under pressure, Linton withdrew the book from sale and pledged to give any proceeds to charity. The actress actually dressed as Marie Antoinette in a 2007 episode of “CSI: NY.” Mnuchin and Linton were in Kentucky on Monday to tour Fort Knox , which holds the federal government’s $200 billion gold reserves.

He wanted to talk about Anthony Scaramucci , whose 10-day tenure as White House communications director had just ended in ignominy. Stone said that Scaramucci reminded him of “a suicide bomber,” then switched centuries for his next metaphor. “The administration is like the French Revolution,” Stone said. “You never know who will be beheaded next.” But Stone didn’t believe that Scaramucci would stay far from the president for long. “As you know, none of us are ever really gone. He still has the president’s cellphone, the president’s private number. Just because he’s not in the White House, no one should think his influence has gone.” When I spoke to Scaramucci on Tuesday afternoon, the financier was more interested in justifying his recent past. From the beginning of his time in the Trump White House , way back on July 20, critics said that Scaramucci was too similar to Trump, too eager to be on TV, to last. Scaramucci was keenly aware of that particular liability. It explains why his opening news conference was so filled with compliments for the president. He knew there was only one person watching whose opinion of him mattered. “The president thought I killed it,” Scaramucci told me the following day, still clearly hyped up by his experience in the White House briefing room. “If you were 7 inches taller, I’d be worried,” Trump told Scaramucci, according to someone familiar with the conversation who asked not to be named quoting the president. The euphoria wouldn’t last long. A Politico reporter alerted Scaramucci that Ryan Lizza of The New Yorker tweeted Wednesday night that Scaramucci was at dinner with the president, first lady Melania Trump, Fox News host Sean Hannity and former Fox News co-president Bill Shine.  Scaramucci was livid about the information being passed on to a reporter. For one thing, he said the guest list was incomplete. The tweets didn’t mention the presence of Ainsley Earhardt and Brian Kilmeade, co-hosts of “Fox & Friends,” as well as White House counselor Kellyanne Conway and Vice President Mike Pence , who, he said, left before the sit-down dinner. For another, he knew that the full guest list also included Kimberly Guilfoyle, co-host of “The Five” on Fox News. Early the next morning, Olivia Nuzzi of New York Magazine confirmed that Guilfoyle was there. Scaramucci realized that the inclusion of Guilfoyle would raise suspicion. He said he was aware that some associates and members of the media were gossiping about his friendship with the Fox host and feared this particular connection would only make matters worse. He said he took it as “an attack.” Scaramucci strongly denies having a sexual relationship with Guilfoyle. Stone, a friend of Guilfoyle’s, explained that Scaramucci and Guilfoyle “are very close friends but nothing more.” He added, “He is way too short for Kimberly.” Through a Fox News spokesperson, Guilfoyle said she’s known Scaramucci for years through her work at Fox News and the two are “good friends.” As soon as Scaramucci returned from Wednesday night’s dinner, he called Lizza and gave his now-infamous interview , published Thursday, in which he suggested that former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus was a “paranoid schizophrenic” and that White House chief strategist Steve Bannon practiced auto-fellatio. Scaramucci said he felt burned by the interview. “ The Lizzas and Scaramuccis have been friends for over 50 years. My dad knew his dad from construction, and we were building a personal relationship. Most of what I said was humorous and joking. Legally, it may have been on the record, but the spirit of it was off. And he knew that.” Still, Scaramucci told me, he has plans to take Lizza out for a beer. When I asked Lizza for his response, he wrote back: “ I’ve only known Anthony in his capacity as a Trump surrogate and then White House communications director. We are not and have never been ‘old family friends,’ though I think our fathers knew each other, so maybe that’s what he’s talking about. (The Long Island Italian world in that generation is relatively small.) But again, that would not be a reason to suppress an explosive on-the-record interview.” According to several sources close to the White House, the president was initially amused by the Lizza exchange but changed his opinion when he saw how much negative attention it was bringing. Scaramucci said he offered to resign before the weekend. The president told him that wouldn’t be necessary, but he instructed Scaramucci to “watch it” in the future, according to someone familiar with the conversation. I spoke with Scaramucci on Saturday morning, and he sounded defeated. “I think I have strep,” he said. On top of everything else, the night before, The New York Post had broken the news of his impending divorce from his second wife, Deidre Ball. That Scaramucci’s marriage was in trouble was hardly a secret. Long before Ball filed for divorce on July 6, Scaramucci was open with friends and associates about what he believed to be the sorry state of their union and how they were struggling through regular counseling sessions. He just hated that his relationship was being discussed in public. A follow-up report from the Post said that Scaramucci didn’t attend the birth of their son last week. Instead, he sent Ball a short congratulatory text. Scaramucci said this is an unfair characterization of events. He told me that Ball’s due date was Aug. 9, so when he boarded Air Force One to West Virginia last Monday to attend the president’s address at the National Scout Jamboree, he didn’t think he’d be in danger of missing the birth. As soon as she texted him that she was going into labor, he said, he looked into chartering a plane from West Virginia but discovered that there was a wide no fly-zone around Air Force One. He explained that he decided to wait to fly back to Washington with the president, then travel to New York from there. As of Tuesday afternoon, he still hadn’t met his son. Scaramucci claimed that right after the birth Ball texted him her request for some space. When I asked about this text, Ball’s lawyer, Jill Stone, responded: “Any texts of that nature had nothing to do with the baby or seeing the baby.” (Jill Stone said she couldn’t comment on the rest of Scaramucci’s version of events.) When I spoke to Scaramucci on Saturday, he didn’t have much to say about the collapse of his marriage. “It’s fine. I mean, what am I going to do?” He perked up when he started talking about the fantastic team he was going to bring into the White House’s communications shop and the big plans he was going to enact after a tumultuous first week. But on Monday morning, Scaramucci knew he was cooked. Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly , the new chief of staff, who insisted that all White House staff report to him, asked for his resignation. “It was a very polite conversation,” Scaramucci says. Scaramucci then went to see Trump, who was unavailable. He ended up speaking with the president, his daughter Ivanka Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, separately later in the day by telephone. All were gracious, he said. “The president told me he knows I have his back, but he has to try to tighten the ship.” So what are you going to do next, I asked him. “I am now going to go dark,” he said. And then? “Then I will reemerge.” He paused. “As me.” CLARIFICATION: The section about Ryan Lizza’s and Olivia Nuzzi’s tweets was changed to more accurately reflect the night’s sequence of events.",71.55,7.4,11.1,1291,1291,"scaramucci

A Politico reporter alerted Scaramucci that Ryan Lizza of The New Yorker tweeted Wednesday night that Scaramucci was at dinner with the president, first lady Melania Trump, Fox News host Sean Hannity and former Fox News co-president Bill Shine.
The tweets didn’t mention the presence of Ainsley Earhardt and Brian Kilmeade, co-hosts of “Fox & Friends,” as well as White House counselor Kellyanne Conway and Vice President Mike Pence , who, he said, left before the sit-down dinner.
For another, he knew that the full guest list also included Kimberly Guilfoyle, co-host of “The Five” on Fox News.
Stone, a friend of Guilfoyle’s, explained that Scaramucci and Guilfoyle “are very close friends but nothing more.” He added, “He is way too short for Kimberly.” Through a Fox News spokesperson, Guilfoyle said she’s known Scaramucci for years through her work at Fox News and the two are “good friends.” As soon as Scaramucci returned from Wednesday night’s dinner, he called Lizza and gave his now-infamous interview , published Thursday, in which he suggested that former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus was a “paranoid schizophrenic” and that White House chief strategist Steve Bannon practiced auto-fellatio.
And he knew that.” Still, Scaramucci told me, he has plans to take Lizza out for a beer.
When I asked Lizza for his response, he wrote back: “ I’ve only known Anthony in his capacity as a Trump surrogate and then White House communications director.
(The Long Island Italian world in that generation is relatively small.) But again, that would not be a reason to suppress an explosive on-the-record interview.” According to several sources close to the White House, the president was initially amused by the Lizza exchange but changed his opinion when he saw how much negative attention it was bringing.
The president told him that wouldn’t be necessary, but he instructed Scaramucci to “watch it” in the future, according to someone familiar with the conversation.
A follow-up report from the Post said that Scaramucci didn’t attend the birth of their son last week.
As soon as she texted him that she was going into labor, he said, he looked into chartering a plane from West Virginia but discovered that there was a wide no fly-zone around Air Force One. He explained that he decided to wait to fly back to Washington with the president, then travel to New York from there.
When I asked about this text, Ball’s lawyer, Jill Stone, responded: “Any texts of that nature had nothing to do with the baby or seeing the baby.” (Jill Stone said she couldn’t comment on the rest of Scaramucci’s version of events.) When I spoke to Scaramucci on Saturday, he didn’t have much to say about the collapse of his marriage.
“The president told me he knows I have his back, but he has to try to tighten the ship.” So what are you going to do next, I asked him."

Many people were shocked at the president’s remark, especially since he suggested Puerto Ricans ― a majority of whom are still without power and drinking water , according to the Defense Department ― weren’t putting in enough effort to help themselves.

Fresh off a third consecutive Emmy win for outstanding reality-competition program, the show has proved that, six years into its run, it’s still capable of reeling in viewers. Recent ratings rival its debut season; this week, nearly 10 million people in the demographic of viewers ages 18-49 tuned in to watch the Top 8 perform, on par with numbers from season one. “Whatever the DNA is that’s making it successful, it just hasn’t changed,” the show’s host and executive producer, Carson Daly, told HuffPost. “It still feels like important, special, fresh, eventized, feel-good TV. All those early themes we wanted to roll out into the marketplace have stood as the pillar of what makes the show successful.” Those early themes Daly’s talking about center on one primary ideal: giving someone who’s been attempting to break into the music industry the opportunity of a lifetime. Singers of all shapes, sizes, ages, backgrounds, races and gender identities are provided the chance to perform in a blind audition on “The Voice,” during which four superstar coaches ( not judges) sit with their backs to the stage, hoping to hear the next Whitney Houston, Justin Timberlake or Taylor Swift. From there, the contestants sing to an audience of at-home viewers eager to vote them into potential stardom. A $100,000 cash prize and a record deal with Republic Records, a subsidiary of Universal Music Group, or, in some cases, with pop and country label Big Machine is on the line. “Where else can you come on a show and sing and not be judged on anything but your talent, your voice?” the show’s executive producer Audrey Morrissey told HuffPost. “You’re in one-on-one tutoring with these people who are doing nothing but trying to shine a light on you and give you the fruits of all their experience in a very concentrated time to help you: to help you win the show, to help you win your career, to help you become a better artist. It’s literally priceless. Money can’t buy that.” Of course, the coaches on “The Voice,” the ones who sit in those massive red chairs that dramatically swivel around at the push of a button, have other motives beyond a desire to “shine a light” on fresh talent. “They’re making a lot of money, too, so don’t forget about that,” Daly joked. According to The Wrap , Blake Shelton and Adam Levine each make about $13 million a season. And t he show not only gives unknown artists a platform but allows its star coaches one, as well. On primetime TV, they can expand their careers by flaunting family-friendly personalities and premiering new music. Before “The Voice,” for example, longtime coach Shelton had hit after hit on the country music charts with No. 1 songs like “Austin,” “Some Beach” and “All About Tonight.” But since his first stint on the show in 2011, his albums have gained mainstream appeal, with “Red River Blue” and “Bringing Back the Sunshine” both landing at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, at points surpassing the likes of Adele’s “21.” With all of its addictive goodness, you’d think the artists emerging from “The Voice” would also gain some momentum in the music business. H owever, the popularity of the show and its celebrity mentors doesn’t necessarily trickle down to the artists the network highlights for months on end. In truth, the show’s 12 winners have produced only five original Top 40 songs and earned one Grammy nomination from 2011 to now. And most of the winners’ singles that ranked on the Hot 100 were either “Voice” performances or original victory songs. Cassadee Pope and Danielle Bradbery are the only artists whose post-“Voice” singles have charted on the list. Unlike the coaches whose fame continues to flourish, it seems many “Voice” winners fare worse in the great expanses of the fair-weather music industry. The days of Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood ― who, after being crowned the champions of “American Idol” in 2002 and 2005, respectively, went on to earn a combined 10 Grammy Awards ― are gone. Today, “The Voice” might do everything in its power to make sure the viewers who vote are captivated by the show’s talent in-season. But once those artists are thrust into the music world, why do we rarely hear about them post-show? We do hear about some winners, l ike Jordan Smith , whose success was personally fostered by executive “Voice” producer Mark Burnett and his wife, Roma Downey. After flawlessly singing Sia’s “Chandelier” to an incredulous row of coaches on the show, he went on to nab three Top 40 hits and three No. 1s on the Hot Christian Songs chart. H is first album, “Something Beautiful,” was a critical and commercial success story as it debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard chart in March 2016, right behind “Voice” coach Gwen Stefani’s “This Is What the Truth Feels Like.” Smith sold 54,000 units in the album’s first week, making him the highest-ranking winner of any singing competition series in the last six years. Nine months later, his holiday album, “’Tis the Season,” peaked at No. 11. He has been touring nationwide ever since. And then there’s Cassadee Pope, who signed to Big Machine after her win. (A source close to the company confirmed to HuffPost that Pope and the label decided to “mutually” part ways this year.) N ow in the country domain, the former pop-punk singer has drawn comparisons to alternative vocalists like Avril Lavigne with her radio-primed voice. The season three champ has produced four Top 40 hits, two of those ― “Over You” and “Stupid Boy” ― being “Voice” performances. Her 2013 hit “Wasting All These Tears” landed at No. 37 and has been played more than 19 million times on Spotify. Her debut solo country record, “Frame by Frame,” also scored a No. 9 placement on the Billboard 200 and sold 43,000 copies in its first week. Just this year, Pope was nominated for a Grammy for best country duo/group performance for her song with Chris Young, “Think of You.” When asked who he thinks truly embodies a “Voice” success story, Daly cited the 28-year-old Florida native. “Cassadee was like a rocker chick in an all-boy band [Hey Monday], almost like Gwen in No Doubt, and she went on Team Blake and now I’ve seen her on red carpets and in Nashville,” he said. Another notable mention is season four winner Danielle Bradbery, who, although not a mainstream darling, has achieved success in the country music realm. The Houston native was 16 when she won the show and went on to release her self-titled debut album just five months later. Like Pope, Bradbery signed to Big Machine. “We knew she had a chance, and we definitely wanted her if she was going to win,” a Big Machine representative told HuffPost. “That was at the height, when media was just like, ‘The Voice, The Voice, The Voice!’” “They knew exactly what we needed to do as soon as I was off ‘The Voice,’ and so they flew me to Nashville and got an album cooking,” Bradbery told HuffPost of her experience with her management team. “Everything was really fast, but I knew they knew what they were doing... they had a plan. They got me on the ‘Today’ show right away, and are just big fans of getting the names and faces out there as much as possible and as fast as possible.” Bradbery’s 2013 single “The Heart of Dixie” peaked at No. 58 on the Hot 100 and performed decently on the Country chart. She toured with Brad Paisley and went on to produce an anthem for the promotional campaign of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi with “My Day.” Bradbery pushed forward with the release of her sophomore album, “I Don’t Believe We’ve Met,” on Dec. 1, and it’s currently No. 41 on the Billboard 200. Her lead single “Sway,” which features more pop-inspired undertones, was released in June and peaked at No. 19 on the Country Digital Songs Sales chart. “If I’m being honest, I didn’t know much about the whole other side of the music industry that you have to create for yourself and your teams... management, label, booking agents, everything along those lines,” she said. “It was definitely a learning experience every step of the way.” As it still is for season 12 winner Chris Blue. Instead of rushing forward with his debut album, the R&B singer from Knoxville, Tennessee, is working diligently with his former coach and now manager, Alicia Keys. “I watch Alicia and how she works, and she goes nonstop,” Blue told HuffPost. “After the show and putting in long hours every day, I realized, ‘Hey, this has to continue. This is now my lifestyle. You have to work hard in this business.’” Daly and Morrissey agree. They say “The Voice” is more of a boot camp than a superstar generator, so if people want to make it in the cutthroat entertainment industry, they’re expected to put their blood, sweat and tears into their own development. Winning, they insist, is hard work. In fact, the producers never wanted to mimic “Idol,” even if it “blazed a path” for them in the TV landscape, Daly said. “We didn’t really create the show to create a celebrity musician or make people rich and famous. That was never really the goal of the show. We are proud to say that so many of the artists who have been on ‘The Voice’ in any capacity have quit their sandwich-making jobs and are doing well in music. And at the end of the day that’s winning, to us.” But not every artist who’s deemed “The Voice” triumphs. For every Christian singer like Smith or country fave like Pope and Bradbery, you have a handful of “winners” who enjoy less of the sensation of a post-“Voice” career. Take, for example, season one runner-up Dia Frampton, who found some success in the early aughts alongside her sister in the indie-rock band Meg & Dia. During her time on “The Voice,” she said, the show, like many other reality programs, attempted to shape and mold its contestants’ stories to attract viewers, not necessarily lifelong fans. “I was introduced as the children’s book author, which was something I very lightly touched upon when we were doing interviews — that I liked writing children’s books, I liked blogging and writing stories. But that was definitely not the highlight in my own mind,” Frampton explained. “I felt like I said, ‘I love yoga,’ and then it became the highlight, even though that’s just a fun thing I do on Saturday mornings. That was interesting, to kind of have that narrative chosen for me.” Other handpicked narratives include We McDonald’s experience with bullying , Janice Freeman’s life as a single mom and cancer survivor and Dylan Gerard’s decision to enter the medical field after his sister’s tragic car accident, all aiming to tug the heartstrings of viewers week by week. Frampton didn’t see herself as a children’s book author. Nor did she think she’d make it that far on the show. Her “sole intention” behind appearing on “The Voice” was to slip in Meg & Dia stories in hopes of getting the duo back on their feet after they spent all their savings on their 2011 album, “Cocoon.” “In the moment, we had been dropped from our label, we didn’t have a publicist, we didn’t have money, and I thought, ‘This is our publicity, possibly,’” she said. “But the band was never mentioned. I mean, I mentioned it, but it was never put on the show.” After Frampton finished second, she was picked up by Universal Republic to kick off a solo career. All the while, her sister Meg was left wondering what could’ve been. “Honestly, there was aftermath to that decision for years,” Dia said. “I think that last year was the first year I felt normal again with my sister, and that’s been a lot of work on our part... I still feel like I abandoned her in a way, and I struggle to deal with that in trying to be successful. I feel like sometimes I wish to not be successful so that I don’t do well and don’t abandon her again.” Following her season’s wrap, Dia and her new team whipped together an album in a few months, which she said was pushed on her by the label. ”I felt like the record was rushed to be put out,” she said of 2011’s “Red.” “I was so excited to work with so many different producers that I think I should’ve focused on working with one person who I really loved because the album kind of ended up being a crazy plethora of songs in all different genres.” Despite that, she insists her time on “The Voice” was a learning experience that led her to open for her coach Shelton and go on tour with James Blunt in China. According to Dia, she thought she’d found her stride when “Red” went double-platinum in parts of Southeast Asia, but shortly after a year of celebrity, she was back to the life of a struggling artist. Now she can’t even go out on tour because she fails to sell enough tickets or make enough money to promote her new album, “Bruises.” She’s currently working at a health food store, making minimum wage, while writing songs for other artists. “I look back at my time, not so much on ‘The Voice’ but post-‘Voice,’ because I felt like that was such a spike in my career and life... It felt like I was doing everything right and I was going to be OK and I was bearing on what I think was success, and then everything just kind of falls down,” she said, getting emotional. “That’s one thing you have to be prepared for as an artist. You have your ups and you have your downs, and your ups feel so amazing and your downs feel so difficult. And I feel like I am in a bit of a down right now. I feel like I’ve been throwing spaghetti at the wall for so long trying to make something hit, just kind of helping other artists get their voice out when I feel like mine is kind of going deeper and deeper into a hole.” There’s no sure way to determine why some artists soar after “The Voice” while others fall flat, but it appears a lot has to do with who’s in a contestant’s corner after they graduate from the show. For example, if talent isn’t thoroughly supported by Universal Music Group after a season ends, albums can go unproduced, unpromoted and unsold. Morrissey explained that, at its discretion, the pop-focused Republic Records chooses how many people it wants to pick up once the finale airs. Sometimes it partners with other labels, like Big Machine, if it thinks it’s not the best fit for a specific artist. “ Pretty much all the winners are picked up,” Morrissey said. “There is choice amongst the label what they do with them, but we, as a television show, once they won, we’re not necessarily personally involved in their careers. We do everything in our power to prop them up, as we can, but that’s when it flips over to, really, the music business.” “When the baton is passed post-‘Voice,’ there’s some problems,” Levine told Howard Stern in 2015, suggesting that the label “fucks it up” because “no one knows what they’re doing.” He continued, “People take over after we do this great job of building these people up on the show. There’s some real issues there.” Season eight winner Sawyer Fredericks had an inconvenient experience shortly after being crowned “The Voice” in 2015. The now 18-year-old said he dropped Republic after his first album, “The Good Storm,” was released, over disagreements about his songwriting process. “It was kind of a mutual decision,” Fredericks told HuffPost, explaining that the label had him co-writing the record even though he wanted to pen his own lyrics. “I think it definitely changed my intent for a lot of songs.” For his sophomore album, “ Hide Your Ghost ,” the now independent singer-songwriter ― who lives on a farm with his family in upstate New York ― wants to take back control of his sound. “I wanted the freedom as full producer. Basically, whatever I say happens with the album, and I have the final word for everything... really conveying what I mean in my original work,” he explained. Fredericks is not the only “Voice” winner to go independent. After the label didn’t fully support his album “Come Through for You,” season one’s Javier Colon voluntarily moved on from Republic. Despite having catchy, potential hits like “Stand Up” (featuring Levine and co-written by Pharrell WIlliams), Colon’s music never got its due. “I went in with high hopes, as I believe everyone did,” Colon told Buddy TV in 2012. “ But when you pour your heart and soul into a new album that you think is really great, and your label who is supposed to support, market and promote your music does neither, it’s really hard not to be upset.” Season 11’s Alisan Porter decided to part ways with Republic, too. The former child star (“Curly Sue,” “Parenthood”), now 36, initially took to Twitter to share the news that she was going independent. “It just wasn’t the right fit for me,” she told People earlier this year. “I have a really clear vision of who I am, and it might not be the most cookie-cutter commercial radio [vision]... I would much rather be true to myself than to do something that didn’t feel right for me.” Same goes for season five winner Tessanne Chin. Her debut album with Republic, “Count on My Love,” sold only 7,000 copies in its first week due to what she deems a lack of promotion . Now the 32-year-old Jamaican reggae-R&B singer is signed to the Justice League Music Group. She’s been performing frequently enough, but hasn’t seen the kind of success Pope and Bradbery have. See also: winners Jermaine Paul, Josh Kaufman, Craig Wayne Boyd and Sundance Head, who have yet to release albums with Republic Records, and perhaps never will. So, what gives? As more and more singing competition “winners” become “losers,” who’s at fault? And is there anything that can revive the once-sensational reality show dream? “You can’t blame a record company or management because, I think, in today’s day and age, you can ‘succeed’ and really take off without it because of the tools that are available to you independently,” Daly said. “ A hit song is a hit song is a hit song, and I don’t care who sings it. You can ask Charlie Puth or Meghan Trainor; Fall Out Boy did this back in the day without any help from radio. If you have a hit song, it’s going to happen for you. It’s just a matter of time.” According to a Big Machine rep, it’s sometimes difficult to market “Voice” talent after the show, in part due to their network association. Because “The Voice” is on NBC, other companies, like CBS or ABC, won’t feature the show’s artists. “The networks are so competitive with one another that you need not only a label behind you, [but] you need to make sure the network is behind you and going to support you beyond you just being on their show,” the rep said. “ If you’re stuck to only being able to do the ‘Today’ show or ‘Access Hollywood’ or another NBC platform, it’s limiting.” Morrissey says, record deal or not, “The Voice” tries to highlight former contestants whenever it can. Just this week, Alisan Porter was able to promote her Las Vegas show, “ The Voice: Neon Dreams , ” which is set to give artists, including Chris Mann (season two), Mary Sarah (season 10), Matthew Schuler (season five) and Matt McAndrew (season seven), a new platform, boosting their profiles once more. “The Voice” also recently highlighted past contestants’ journeys on the web-exclusive series “ After The Voice .” “We do try to keep tabs on them. We do invite them back and have them perform on the show when they’re ready and they have music. To the best of our ability we push all of their work on all our socials. We try to do what we can,” Morrissey said. “It is what it is. We try our best.” Fredericks, for one, confirmed that “The Voice” producers have kept tabs on him and his career. “I don’t think it’s completely like I’m on my own. They’ve helped out quite a bit, and they’ve offered me to do stuff with the show,” he said. “It’s really fun to go back; it’s like a whole family. And it’s still going! This show, like everything, is just go, go, go.” The coaches are also a big part of the equation. Bradbery’s former mentor, Shelton, who she called “very genuine,” pays attention to the music she’s releasing. He congratulated her on a recent single, which Bradbery said he does as often as he can. “He definitely keeps everybody that’s been on his team under his wing, which I think is really amazing about him. What you see on TV of Blake is exactly what you’ll get. He’s not fake.” The same could be said about most of the coaches who attempt to stay in contact with their contestants after “The Voice,” Morrissey said. Levine has signed former artists to his record label, 222, while Keys continues to work and write with Blue. “Coaches go to a lot of lengths to help people keep growing far more than the public sees. We just don’t really have enough time or way on our show to illustrate that,” Morrissey said. “I’m just thinking about Christina [Aguilera] and Alisan Porter ― they’re still very close and work together. Miley [Cyrus], famously, my God, she keeps in touch with everybody, is texting constantly.” “It’s more than just a season to them or show or just a moment in time, but they really take on the artists as their own and really care about these individuals,” Blue told HuffPost. However, it’s not just the winning artists who take their shot in the ruthless world of music post-“Voice.” Throughout every season of the show, hundreds of contestants rotate in and out of the spotlight. Another famous reality show contestant is proof you don’t have to win to win : Jennifer Hudson. She is currently a coach on “The Voice,” but she placed seventh in the 2004 season of “American Idol.” She’s since won a Grammy for her album “Jennifer Hudson,” and Oscar, Golden Globe, British Academy Film and Screen Actors Guild awards for her role as Effie White in 2006’s “Dreamgirls.” Perhaps, with her experience, she can help guide her three eliminated live-show contestants, Davon Fleming, Shi’Ann Jones and Noah Mac, to mainstream success without a crown. “When she’s looking at them and saying, ‘I’ve been you. I’ve been right where you are. I know how to do this. I know how you’re feeling. I can help you navigate the waters once we’re successful.’ I mean, how do you not take somebody up on that offer? That’s valuable,” Daly said. “And having Kelly [Clarkson] on next season, too, will be the same thing.” In Clarkson’s mind, making your way to the top of the music charts after appearing on a singing competition show has a lot to do with perseverance. But, of course, luck plays a role, too. “The question is always, ‘Why does this one make it and why didn’t this one?’ And it’s hard to tell you that because I think if we knew the answer we’d bottle it up and sell it so everybody could make it,” Clarkson told HuffPost. “Jennifer Hudson and I had this talk when I worked with her recently. We were both like, ‘You know, it’s really not even winning.’ Like she’s the best example of that. It’s taking that opportunity, making something of it and being OK with the fact that it might not be exactly what you thought it was going to be.” We’ve seen that sort of attitude with “Voice” contestants like RaeLynn , who, at 23, is now one of the most sought-after songwriters in Nashville after being eliminated in the quarterfinals of season two. Her debut album, “Wildhorse,” hit No. 1 on Billboard’s Country Albums Chart and landed within the Top 10 on the All-Genre Album Sales Chart in 2017. This success, though, came after she left Big Machine and joined forces with Warner Music Nashville, which helped her sink into who she wanted to be as an artist. Under its guidance, she wrote “Love Triangle,” which garnered her a whole lot of attention for its raw and honest lyrics about being a child of divorce. “Within a week, I had so many other writers who wanted to write with me because of that song,” RaeLynn told Billboard . “It goes to show a great song is what can change a lot for you, and that’s what that song did for me.” RaeLynn credited Nashville as a pivotal environment. This might explain why a select few winners have flourished when they focused on Music City. “Everybody knows everybody, and when they find out there’s a new artist that’s great, everybody is going to support them,” she said. “They don’t just support artists who’ve already made it. They want to support new artists, and I think that’s so special.” And it seems country music listeners want to support emerging artists, as well. A source close to “The Voice” told HuffPost that voting during the show typically takes off in local markets when there’s a particularly moving performance. For example, when Sundance Head advanced in the competition, “The Voice” saw a huge spike in voters from Texas. “A lot of people who haven’t won the show [and are successful] are just people from Team Blake... He’s from that world and they take care of their own, no doubt about it,” Daly said, mentioning acts like RaeLynn, the Swon Brothers and Gwen Sebastian, who toured with Shelton and wrote three songs on Miranda Lambert’s latest critically acclaimed album, “The Weight of These Wings.” Ultimately, Clarkson believes no singing competition winner should ever feel like they’re automatically going to be a superstar with a dozen No. 1s. “That’s a level of entitlement that’s going to end up not really working out well,” she advised. “TV is so powerful, right? Use that platform and use that stage to really showcase what you have, and then use that opportunity to meet as many people as you can meet. That’s all we can really do because there’s no rhyme or reason to why some of us make it and some of us don’t. We all work hard. But some of it is the aligning of the stars.” Even with the ups and downs, most if not all of the contestants HuffPost spoke to had nothing but fond memories from their time on “The Voice,” and credited the show for giving them a place to shine. “I loved it as a learning experience, and I’m happy I did it,” Fredericks said. Bradbery and Blue expressed similar sentiments. “If it wasn’t for ‘The Voice,’ I’d be home doing regular stuff, so it was probably the biggest high moment of my whole entire life,” Bradbery said. “It’s been amazing.” “‘The Voice’ is a really great concept,” Frampton said. “At first, I honestly thought, ‘OK, this has to be rigged. Somebody has to tell the coaches to turn around for certain people.’ But going through the show and seeing the process, I truly believe that it is very genuine.” Despite the inconsistent track record, the hope for post-show success persists. “The Voice” is expected to continue running two cycles a year until ratings dip (which likely won’t happen anytime soon). Daly said that because there’s so much content out there, in order to stay relevant you have to be on top of your game. “There’s very little appointment viewing,” he said. “If you go away too long, you run the risk of just like falling into oblivion. There’s a successful Mark Burnett competition reality program [‘Survivor’] that’s been on twice a year on CBS for 35 seasons, and it works!” Daly and Morrissey also know their show is entertaining a robust audience and fills that feel-good void on TV. Because when it comes down to it, the winners of “The Voice” are the network, the coaches and, undoubtedly, the devoted fans who get to see a produced version of the American Dream play out before them. They might not be tuning in to vote for album sales or chart appearances, but they’re glued to their seats in anticipation of each season’s climax. Win or lose, prevailing after “The Voice,” like any other talent show, is the luck of the draw. But who knows? With a younger, more pop-rock-inspired crop of season 13 finalists (including Brooke Simpson, 26, Chloe Kohanski, 23, and Addison Agen, 16), the future winner could fare better. There’s still a country singer in the mix, though, ahead of next week’s finale, 40-year-old Red Marlow. Will a Tennessee crooner reign supreme once again? If we had to guess, we’d say yes. UPDATE : (Dec. 20) ― Rock-pop singer Chloe Kohanski was crowned Season 13′s “The Voice.” With that, her coach, Blake Shelton, secured his sixth win . Additional reporting by Lauren Moraski . CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the title of Stefani’s album. It is “This Is What the Truth Feels Like” not “What the Truth Feels Like.”",69.52,8.2,10.1,4981,4981,"likes

way","“Whatever the DNA is that’s making it successful, it just hasn’t changed,” the show’s host and executive producer, Carson Daly, told HuffPost.
All those early themes we wanted to roll out into the marketplace have stood as the pillar of what makes the show successful.” Those early themes Daly’s talking about center on one primary ideal: giving someone who’s been attempting to break into the music industry the opportunity of a lifetime.
Singers of all shapes, sizes, ages, backgrounds, races and gender identities are provided the chance to perform in a blind audition on “The Voice,” during which four superstar coaches ( not judges) sit with their backs to the stage, hoping to hear the next Whitney Houston, Justin Timberlake or Taylor Swift.
A $100,000 cash prize and a record deal with Republic Records, a subsidiary of Universal Music Group, or, in some cases, with pop and country label Big Machine is on the line.
“Where else can you come on a show and sing and not be judged on anything but your talent, your voice?” the show’s executive producer Audrey Morrissey told HuffPost.
Before “The Voice,” for example, longtime coach Shelton had hit after hit on the country music charts with No. 1 songs like “Austin,” “Some Beach” and “All About Tonight.” But since his first stint on the show in 2011, his albums have gained mainstream appeal, with “Red River Blue” and “Bringing Back the Sunshine” both landing at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, at points surpassing the likes of Adele’s “21.” With all of its addictive goodness, you’d think the artists emerging from “The Voice” would also gain some momentum in the music business.
Unlike the coaches whose fame continues to flourish, it seems many “Voice” winners fare worse in the great expanses of the fair-weather music industry.
Today, “The Voice” might do everything in its power to make sure the viewers who vote are captivated by the show’s talent in-season.
H is first album, “Something Beautiful,” was a critical and commercial success story as it debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard chart in March 2016, right behind “Voice” coach Gwen Stefani’s “This Is What the Truth Feels Like.” Smith sold 54,000 units in the album’s first week, making him the highest-ranking winner of any singing competition series in the last six years.
(A source close to the company confirmed to HuffPost that Pope and the label decided to “mutually” part ways this year.) N ow in the country domain, the former pop-punk singer has drawn comparisons to alternative vocalists like Avril Lavigne with her radio-primed voice.
Just this year, Pope was nominated for a Grammy for best country duo/group performance for her song with Chris Young, “Think of You.” When asked who he thinks truly embodies a “Voice” success story, Daly cited the 28-year-old Florida native.
“Cassadee was like a rocker chick in an all-boy band [Hey Monday], almost like Gwen in No Doubt, and she went on Team Blake and now I’ve seen her on red carpets and in Nashville,” he said.
Another notable mention is season four winner Danielle Bradbery, who, although not a mainstream darling, has achieved success in the country music realm.
“We knew she had a chance, and we definitely wanted her if she was going to win,” a Big Machine representative told HuffPost.
“That was at the height, when media was just like, ‘The Voice, The Voice, The Voice!’” “They knew exactly what we needed to do as soon as I was off ‘The Voice,’ and so they flew me to Nashville and got an album cooking,” Bradbery told HuffPost of her experience with her management team.
They got me on the ‘Today’ show right away, and are just big fans of getting the names and faces out there as much as possible and as fast as possible.” Bradbery’s 2013 single “The Heart of Dixie” peaked at No. 58 on the Hot 100 and performed decently on the Country chart.
She toured with Brad Paisley and went on to produce an anthem for the promotional campaign of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi with “My Day.” Bradbery pushed forward with the release of her sophomore album, “I Don’t Believe We’ve Met,” on Dec. 1, and it’s currently No. 41 on the Billboard 200.
“It was definitely a learning experience every step of the way.” As it still is for season 12 winner Chris Blue.
Instead of rushing forward with his debut album, the R&B singer from Knoxville, Tennessee, is working diligently with his former coach and now manager, Alicia Keys.
And at the end of the day that’s winning, to us.” But not every artist who’s deemed “The Voice” triumphs.
For every Christian singer like Smith or country fave like Pope and Bradbery, you have a handful of “winners” who enjoy less of the sensation of a post-“Voice” career.
Take, for example, season one runner-up Dia Frampton, who found some success in the early aughts alongside her sister in the indie-rock band Meg & Dia. During her time on “The Voice,” she said, the show, like many other reality programs, attempted to shape and mold its contestants’ stories to attract viewers, not necessarily lifelong fans.
“I felt like I said, ‘I love yoga,’ and then it became the highlight, even though that’s just a fun thing I do on Saturday mornings.
Her “sole intention” behind appearing on “The Voice” was to slip in Meg & Dia stories in hopes of getting the duo back on their feet after they spent all their savings on their 2011 album, “Cocoon.” “In the moment, we had been dropped from our label, we didn’t have a publicist, we didn’t have money, and I thought, ‘This is our publicity, possibly,’” she said.
I feel like sometimes I wish to not be successful so that I don’t do well and don’t abandon her again.” Following her season’s wrap, Dia and her new team whipped together an album in a few months, which she said was pushed on her by the label.
”I felt like the record was rushed to be put out,” she said of 2011’s “Red.” “I was so excited to work with so many different producers that I think I should’ve focused on working with one person who I really loved because the album kind of ended up being a crazy plethora of songs in all different genres.” Despite that, she insists her time on “The Voice” was a learning experience that led her to open for her coach Shelton and go on tour with James Blunt in China.
Now she can’t even go out on tour because she fails to sell enough tickets or make enough money to promote her new album, “Bruises.” She’s currently working at a health food store, making minimum wage, while writing songs for other artists.
It felt like I was doing everything right and I was going to be OK and I was bearing on what I think was success, and then everything just kind of falls down,” she said, getting emotional.
I feel like I’ve been throwing spaghetti at the wall for so long trying to make something hit, just kind of helping other artists get their voice out when I feel like mine is kind of going deeper and deeper into a hole.” There’s no sure way to determine why some artists soar after “The Voice” while others fall flat, but it appears a lot has to do with who’s in a contestant’s corner after they graduate from the show.
For example, if talent isn’t thoroughly supported by Universal Music Group after a season ends, albums can go unproduced, unpromoted and unsold.
Morrissey explained that, at its discretion, the pop-focused Republic Records chooses how many people it wants to pick up once the finale airs.
Sometimes it partners with other labels, like Big Machine, if it thinks it’s not the best fit for a specific artist.
We do everything in our power to prop them up, as we can, but that’s when it flips over to, really, the music business.” “When the baton is passed post-‘Voice,’ there’s some problems,” Levine told Howard Stern in 2015, suggesting that the label “fucks it up” because “no one knows what they’re doing.” He continued, “People take over after we do this great job of building these people up on the show.
There’s some real issues there.” Season eight winner Sawyer Fredericks had an inconvenient experience shortly after being crowned “The Voice” in 2015.
The now 18-year-old said he dropped Republic after his first album, “The Good Storm,” was released, over disagreements about his songwriting process.
“It was kind of a mutual decision,” Fredericks told HuffPost, explaining that the label had him co-writing the record even though he wanted to pen his own lyrics.
“I think it definitely changed my intent for a lot of songs.” For his sophomore album, “ Hide Your Ghost ,” the now independent singer-songwriter ― who lives on a farm with his family in upstate New York ― wants to take back control of his sound.
“ But when you pour your heart and soul into a new album that you think is really great, and your label who is supposed to support, market and promote your music does neither, it’s really hard not to be upset.” Season 11’s Alisan Porter decided to part ways with Republic, too.
“You can’t blame a record company or management because, I think, in today’s day and age, you can ‘succeed’ and really take off without it because of the tools that are available to you independently,” Daly said.
Because “The Voice” is on NBC, other companies, like CBS or ABC, won’t feature the show’s artists.
“The networks are so competitive with one another that you need not only a label behind you, [but] you need to make sure the network is behind you and going to support you beyond you just being on their show,” the rep said.
“ If you’re stuck to only being able to do the ‘Today’ show or ‘Access Hollywood’ or another NBC platform, it’s limiting.” Morrissey says, record deal or not, “The Voice” tries to highlight former contestants whenever it can.
We try our best.” Fredericks, for one, confirmed that “The Voice” producers have kept tabs on him and his career.
“I don’t think it’s completely like I’m on my own.
Levine has signed former artists to his record label, 222, while Keys continues to work and write with Blue.
Miley [Cyrus], famously, my God, she keeps in touch with everybody, is texting constantly.” “It’s more than just a season to them or show or just a moment in time, but they really take on the artists as their own and really care about these individuals,” Blue told HuffPost.
However, it’s not just the winning artists who take their shot in the ruthless world of music post-“Voice.” Throughout every season of the show, hundreds of contestants rotate in and out of the spotlight.
She is currently a coach on “The Voice,” but she placed seventh in the 2004 season of “American Idol.” She’s since won a Grammy for her album “Jennifer Hudson,” and Oscar, Golden Globe, British Academy Film and Screen Actors Guild awards for her role as Effie White in 2006’s “Dreamgirls.” Perhaps, with her experience, she can help guide her three eliminated live-show contestants, Davon Fleming, Shi’Ann Jones and Noah Mac, to mainstream success without a crown.
“And having Kelly [Clarkson] on next season, too, will be the same thing.” In Clarkson’s mind, making your way to the top of the music charts after appearing on a singing competition show has a lot to do with perseverance.
“The question is always, ‘Why does this one make it and why didn’t this one?’ And it’s hard to tell you that because I think if we knew the answer we’d bottle it up and sell it so everybody could make it,” Clarkson told HuffPost.
It’s taking that opportunity, making something of it and being OK with the fact that it might not be exactly what you thought it was going to be.” We’ve seen that sort of attitude with “Voice” contestants like RaeLynn , who, at 23, is now one of the most sought-after songwriters in Nashville after being eliminated in the quarterfinals of season two.
This success, though, came after she left Big Machine and joined forces with Warner Music Nashville, which helped her sink into who she wanted to be as an artist.
“Everybody knows everybody, and when they find out there’s a new artist that’s great, everybody is going to support them,” she said.
They want to support new artists, and I think that’s so special.” And it seems country music listeners want to support emerging artists, as well.
A source close to “The Voice” told HuffPost that voting during the show typically takes off in local markets when there’s a particularly moving performance.
He’s from that world and they take care of their own, no doubt about it,” Daly said, mentioning acts like RaeLynn, the Swon Brothers and Gwen Sebastian, who toured with Shelton and wrote three songs on Miranda Lambert’s latest critically acclaimed album, “The Weight of These Wings.” Ultimately, Clarkson believes no singing competition winner should ever feel like they’re automatically going to be a superstar with a dozen No. 1s.
“The Voice” is expected to continue running two cycles a year until ratings dip (which likely won’t happen anytime soon).
There’s a successful Mark Burnett competition reality program [‘Survivor’] that’s been on twice a year on CBS for 35 seasons, and it works!” Daly and Morrissey also know their show is entertaining a robust audience and fills that feel-good void on TV.
Because when it comes down to it, the winners of “The Voice” are the network, the coaches and, undoubtedly, the devoted fans who get to see a produced version of the American Dream play out before them.
Win or lose, prevailing after “The Voice,” like any other talent show, is the luck of the draw.
UPDATE : (Dec. 20) ― Rock-pop singer Chloe Kohanski was crowned Season 13′s “The Voice.” With that, her coach, Blake Shelton, secured his sixth win ."

It isn’t the most egregious thing he’s ever done, as we know thanks to Anthony Rapp . The incident Rapp described to BuzzFeed occurred a few years before my own, and more horrifyingly, Rapp was in a strangely isolated situation. When I read his account of what happened, I was actually relieved. It could have been so much worse. Thankfully, it wasn’t. Rapp and I never crossed paths in those days — he’s slightly older than I am — but it seems we led somewhat similar childhoods. I don’t think there’s much of a “fraternity” among former child actors, though we certainly all know a little something about the oddities of the experience. To this day, when I tell my wife a story about getting tutored on movie sets for three hours a day or spending several hours after school in a car, headed to New York City for three auditions, she shakes her head and says, “You had a weird childhood.” Maybe. But I loved it. Not the acting so much. I gave it up as soon as adulthood came, and I was far more interested in John Milton than Al Pacino. But what I did love were the opportunities: to travel, to stay up way later than all my classmates, to be treated as an adult. And most importantly, to meet some of the most interesting people I’ve ever known. Much of how I think and feel about the world today comes from the privilege of my “weird” childhood. Kevin Spacey and I were in the original cast of “ Lost in Yonkers ” in 1991. We got along great. He’s an affable, funny guy, as anyone who has seen him on ” Saturday Night Live” knows. Great at impressions. Easy to talk to. A lot of fun. I remember being fascinated by the distinctive scar on his face, but too afraid to ask about it. But I bet he wouldn’t have minded if I did. And I’ll never forget sitting in the lounge of a hotel on a chilly night in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. We talked about the show, my adolescent vicissitudes, his age (for some reason I couldn’t believe he was only 32). It was actually a beautiful night. I was charmed; my parents were charmed. I went to bed feeling good that Kevin Spacey was my friend. Back in New York, the play received rave reviews and won a bunch of Tony Awards. Kevin and I were peers in one of Broadway’s biggest hits. We became good friends. We’d go out for dinner, shoot the shit backstage, and there was even a plan for me to hang out at his apartment in between shows on a matinee day. Mostly, though, we hung out in his dressing room. Kevin had one of the “luxurious” dressing rooms on the other side of the theater. It was spacious. There was a couch and a TV and one of those fancy Hollywood mirrors with the light bulbs all around it. We spent many nights in there before the show watching basketball, especially when the playoffs came around. It was on one of those nights, with the goddamn Celtics on the television, that Kevin Spacey put his hand on my thigh. To say I remember the exact circumstances or how high up he placed his hand would be a lie. As a diagnosed obsessive-compulsive, I have often doubted my memory. In fact, I just got off the phone with my mother, and she says that I couldn’t even say on that day, with absolute certainty, exactly what had happened. But she knew I was scared. And — knowing that her son wasn’t one to make up stories for attention — she came to pick me up so I didn’t have to go to Kevin’s house. But I do think my OCD hamstrung my parents. They were already managing a child who kept crazy lists of his guilty feelings, had exposed himself in a supermarket at age 4 because of an inexplicable compulsion, and was fixated on the number five. Maybe this was just another version of an illness they didn’t understand? And so we said nothing. And we did nothing. If I’m being totally honest, I’ve never thought, until now, about saying something, even in my adult years. In fact, I have used the details of the incident several times as a kind of “party story,” something to pique the interest of semi-drunk people standing in a semi-drunk circle near the hors d’oeuvres, often following the story with a casual declaration: “Everybody knows this stuff about Spacey.” When I think about those moments now, I am ashamed. I’m trying to figure out why I am writing about this, why Anthony Rapp’s disclosure has made me want to sit down and find words. The easiest answer is that writing is my life. I use words to figure things out. I never understand anything until I have tried to write about it. That moment with Kevin never affected me very much. I’m not sure why. A few years after the incident, I even accepted an invitation from him to a screening of ” Glengarry Glen Ross .” But there’s something else, something I have been struggling with in the days since Rapp’s revelation. And the best I can come up with is… In 1951, William Faulkner wrote, “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.” And that, quite succinctly, is it . We can never escape our pasts. Not me, not Kevin Spacey, not Anthony Rapp. I treated the Spacey situation as a joke, a punchline at dinner parties. And now I am forced to confront the seriousness of something that I, and my parents, should have treated differently. As for Kevin, he’s been able to avoid this for years. Not now. Not anymore. I want to be generous and say that, somewhere along the line, Kevin has been hurt, too — fucked up by a society that punishes people for honesty. Pedophilia is a psychiatric disorder in which one feels an attraction to prepubescent children. There are legions of people who have these feelings and don’t act on them. What if Kevin Spacey had been given space to talk about his attractions without fear of cultural sanction? Would we still be having this conversation? But of course Kevin, as a successful actor, likely had more opportunities than most to get help. And in fact, his apology took no responsibility for his behavior, and conflated his sexuality with his predation. I’d like to forgive him. I’d like to believe he’s redeemable, if only because it gets me off the hook for the blitheness of my response. But until Kevin comes clean, he won’t deserve absolution for sins he doesn’t even seem to understand. As for Anthony Rapp, I applaud his decision to speak out, his willingness to revisit an old wound. But even he knows that he is not the story here. As Rapp said on his Twitter page, “ I came forward with my story, standing on the shoulders of the many courageous women and men who have been speaking to shine a light and hopefully make a difference, as they have done for me.” He’s right. The truth is that this is a never-ending story with a never-ending list of heroes and victims. And a lot of people in between. I never went back to Kevin’s dressing room. He must have known something was up. And he tried to make nice. I was the first of the original cast members to leave ” Lost in Yonkers .” In fact, Manny Azenberg, the play’s producer, agreed to let me out of my contract early so I could get to California in time to start filming ” Brooklyn Bridge .” After my last show, most of the cast and crew went down the block to McHale’s, an old-fashioned Irish bar and grill that has since been torn down. Daisy Eagan, who won a Tony Award that year as an 11-year-old, was there. We’d been in ” Les Misérables” together a few years before. Kevin was in a great mood. There is even a picture of us from that night: him holding me in the air, smiling for the camera; me, arms and legs flailing, feigning distress. Later, he handed me a portable Atari Lynx video game console as a going-away present. There was no box and there was one game already inserted into the console. It was as if he had bought it for himself and decided it might be a good way to curry my favor. I played that single game for hours upon hours in the backseat of my parents’ Toyota Previa van as we drove across country. Danny Lanzetta is a novelist and a degenerate Knicks fan.

It was on one of those nights, with the goddamn Celtics on the television, that Kevin Spacey put his hand on my thigh.
In fact, I just got off the phone with my mother, and she says that I couldn’t even say on that day, with absolute certainty, exactly what had happened.
And — knowing that her son wasn’t one to make up stories for attention — she came to pick me up so I didn’t have to go to Kevin’s house.
If I’m being totally honest, I’ve never thought, until now, about saying something, even in my adult years.
In fact, I have used the details of the incident several times as a kind of “party story,” something to pique the interest of semi-drunk people standing in a semi-drunk circle near the hors d’oeuvres, often following the story with a casual declaration: “Everybody knows this stuff about Spacey.” When I think about those moments now, I am ashamed.
I’m trying to figure out why I am writing about this, why Anthony Rapp’s disclosure has made me want to sit down and find words.
Not me, not Kevin Spacey, not Anthony Rapp.
As for Kevin, he’s been able to avoid this for years.
I want to be generous and say that, somewhere along the line, Kevin has been hurt, too — fucked up by a society that punishes people for honesty.
There are legions of people who have these feelings and don’t act on them.
What if Kevin Spacey had been given space to talk about his attractions without fear of cultural sanction?
But of course Kevin, as a successful actor, likely had more opportunities than most to get help.
I’d like to believe he’s redeemable, if only because it gets me off the hook for the blitheness of my response.
But until Kevin comes clean, he won’t deserve absolution for sins he doesn’t even seem to understand.
But even he knows that he is not the story here.
As Rapp said on his Twitter page, “ I came forward with my story, standing on the shoulders of the many courageous women and men who have been speaking to shine a light and hopefully make a difference, as they have done for me.” He’s right.
Kevin was in a great mood."

I’m a black woman,” the singer explained. “So it’s been weird navigating that. When I was growing up I didn’t know if I was supposed to love TLC or Britney.” The singer also spoke about the work of white allies in the current racial and political climate. “White guilt is funny, but this is a really hard time for white allies. People don’t want to do too much but want to do enough, and in my bubble of Los Angeles I’m surrounded by a lot of good people with a lot of good intentions,” she said. “But as I learned in this past election, my bubble is just a small fraction of how this country operates.

The study was published in July 2017 by researchers from Indiana University in partnership with OMGYes , an online interactive learning tool that teaches users about female pleasure. Researchers conducted the national online survey in 2015, which included 1,055 primarily heterosexual women (91 percent) between the ages of 18 and 94 years old. More than half of respondents were married and 65 percent identified as white. The survey asked a wide array of questions regarding female pleasure including the participant’s sexual preferences, sexual behaviors, quality of orgasms and if she can orgasm during intercourse. Researchers found that 36 percent of women reported that they needed clitoral stimulation in order to orgasm during intercourse with another 36 percent reporting that while they do not require clitoral stimulation to reach climax during intercourse, it most definitely enhances an orgasm. Other findings focused on the specific types of genital touching and stimulation women prefer. The data about genital touching was taken from 1,000 informal video chats conducted by OMGYes between 2014 and 2015. OMGYes co-founder Rob Perkins told HuffPost that most of the women interviewed in the informal video chats did not identify as straight. “Overall, results demonstrated substantial variability among American women’s preferences,” the study reads. “And while some kinds of genital touching or stimulation were more often preferred than others, most women endorsed a narrow range of touch techniques, underscoring the value of partner communication to sexual pleasure and satisfaction.” Watch OMGYes’ video about the initial research below. The interview questions about genital touching conducted by OMGYes were very specific: What amount of pressure do you prefer? (from being touched very lightly to medium and hard pressure); What shape or style of motion do you prefer? (“Side to side, up and down, diagonal, circular, tall ovals, wide ovals, pushing/pressing in one spot, pulsating/rapid pushing in one spot,” etc.); Where do you prefer to be touched on your vulva/vagina? (“Directly on clitoris, on the skin around clitoris, avoid touching clitoris directly, occasionally brushing over clitoris but not applying pressure to it,” etc.); And, lastly, what preference of touch do you prefer? (fingers, hands, mouth, etc.). According to the study’s findings, two thirds of respondents preferred direct clitoral stimulation with most reporting that they also like stimulation just around the clitoris. When it comes to preferred shapes and styles of genital touching, 63 percent of women said they like up and down motions and 51 percent of women said they liked circular movements. A good amount of women (41 percent) preferred just one style of touch instead of multiple. Researchers also found that most women prefer light or medium pressure, with 16 percent reported that they liked all types of pressure during stimulation. “Women might find it helpful to think about these different dimensions of genital touch or stimulation when exploring their sexual response during solo or partnered sexual play,” the study reads. “And therapists and educators might find these dimensions helpful in making specific suggestions to couples. Having these four dimensions of touch in mind may give individuals or couples more direction or concrete ideas to experiment with that go beyond broad encouragement to simply ‘go explore and see what you like.’” This article has been updated with more information about the 2014-2015 OMGYes video chat interviews.

The court rejected her lawyer’s claim that the video was not admissible evidence because it had been illegally posted on the internet.

One person died and 19 others were injured in the incident. By Saturday evening, multiple publications were reporting that suspect James Fields, 20, of Maumee, Ohio, had been arrested in connection with the tragedy. “James Alex Fields Jr.... is charged with one count of 2nd degree murder, 3 counts of malicious wounding and one count of failing to stop at an accident resulting in a death,” Col. Martin Kumer, the superintendent of Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail, told HuffPost in an email. Kumer provided a mug shot of Fields. Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer announced the death on Twitter, hours after the governor declared a state of emergency . Hospital officials confirmed to The Associated Press the number of casualties. Fifteen other injuries related to the rally were reported, the City of Charlottesville said. The victim who died was a 32-year-old woman, Chief Al Thomas of the Charlottesville Police Department said at a news conference. Following a morning of clashes, the white supremacists at the rally and counter-protesters began to clear out Saturday afternoon after police threatened arrests. Hundreds of counter-protesters had met together to oppose the white supremacist gathering, marching in solidarity with marginalized groups and chanting “Black Lives Matter!” among other slogans. “It was an incredible scene,” 23-year-old Thomas Pilnik, who captured the anti-racist counter-demonstration on video, told HuffPost. “It was the most beautiful counter-rally.” Moments later, a car plowed into the crowd, and bodies went flying. “It was just terrifying,” said Pilnik, who has lived in Charlottesville for five years and works as an administrator for the University of Virginia’s school of engineering. “I remember people flying into me, telling me to run and get out of the way and watching people fly like they were just bowling pins.” Pilnik added that it was a “beautiful moment ripped away from us.” Pilnik believes the driver’s action was deliberate. “There is nothing in my mind that would ever tell me that this wasn’t an intentional act,” he said. “The way he plowed into the crowd and then reversed at full speed was nothing short of intentional. If he had been scared and made a mistake and rammed the people and hit the back of a car, there’s no way he would have shifted into reverse and slammed on the accelerator to run them over again.” Video shows the vehicle reverse back at a high rate of speed, running over people who’d just been struck, Pilnik said. Pilnik said white supremacy is all too real. And it’s time to take it seriously. “It’s taken me a long time to process, but I think it’s the fact that these [white supremacists] aren’t laughable,” he said. “They aren’t trolls, we actually have domestic terrorism going on and we’ve spent months, if not years, laughing them off. And that just can’t happen, it can’t continue to happen, it shouldn’t have happened in the first place, but what I’ve seen today just proves to me that it’s not a joke. These terrorists aren’t trolls ― they’re terrorists ― they’re bad people.” Fields’ mother, Samantha Bloom, told the Toledo Blade on Saturday that her son had told her he was going to Virginia for an “alt-right” rally but didn’t describe it to her in detail. Bloom said she’d warned her son to be careful and to protest “peacefully,” according to the newspaper. Bloom told The Associated Press that she wasn’t aware that the event was a white supremacist rally. “ I thought it had to do with Trump ,” she said. “Trump’s not a white supremacist.” When informed of the death and violence at the rally, Bloom “became visibly upset,” according to the AP. After the rally late Saturday night, the FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia announced a civil rights investigation into the circumstances surrounding the deadly car crash. Attorney Jeff Sessions also announced a federal investigation into the violence at the rally. This story has been updated with information about the suspect, comments from his mother and the announcement of the federal investigations.

Chances are Judd Apatow could tell. In the case of President Donald Trump ’s slurred speech during a recent public address, Apatow told HuffPost, “I mean, I work with people and watch them speak all day long, people of every age. I’ve seen people with all sorts of levels of dampness and dryness.” “That’s not dry mouth. I can’t tell you what that was,” he added. White House spokesperson Raj Shah told reporters about the speech, “His throat was dry. There’s nothing to it.” Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders reiterated that point. Apatow tweeted his disagreement with the White House’s conclusion on Thursday, writing, “He is showing signs of aging and ill health.” The producer and director shared more thoughts with HuffPost during an interview about his upcoming Netflix comedy special and appearance at New York’s 92Y . “It wasn’t stumbling over one word. It was a solid minute of some sort of occurrence that could be almost anything, certainly not dry mouth. I had Norman Lloyd in my movie. He was 99 years old when we shot. He’s 103 now. I’ve never heard him speak like that,” he said. “My grandmother, who’s 94 and in assisted living, talks like that, and I certainly love her but would also not want her to be the president.” Apatow added that the “best-case scenario” is that the president was speaking oddly because his dentures are about to fall out and he doesn’t want to admit he has them. Though Apatow also doubts that explanation , too. “I think we’re all concerned that there’s not a lot of rational thought happening and we wish we could get accurate medical information. We all remember that man who presented himself as Trump’s doctor and said that Trump was the healthiest guy he’s ever seen. I don’t think you become the healthiest man in the world by eating Kentucky Fried Chicken for a majority of your meals,” said Apatow. “Like his taxes, we’ll probably never know until too late what his actual health is,” he said. Though the producer, director and stand-up comedian is very vocal about his political views on Twitter, he doesn’t view his social media presence and his comedy as connected. Apatow said there is a little political humor in his act, but that people can’t “normalize what’s happening” from the White House, and that it’s “so outrageous, so criminal and corrupt” that he feels it’s important to say it over and over again. He explained, “Something will happen, like they say it’s OK to pollute streams more, but then they do 10 new things the next day and everybody forgets streams, so I always feel an obligation to point that out, not necessarily in entertaining terms. The stand-up is sharing my thoughts and my life in a way that makes people happy. Twitter is more about spreading pertinent information.” You can see Apatow’s stand-up special “The Return” when it drops on Netflix on Tuesday, Dec. 12, the same day he’ll also be appearing at 92Y performing some of his act. In the meantime, if the president is really that parched, can somebody please get him a glass of water? Preferably one he doesn’t have to hold with two hands .",71.65,7.4,11.1,544,544,"apatow

But even then, before the cancer became a death sentence, Lindsay’s boyfriend, David Mosher, wanted her to know that she wasn’t fighting this by herself. “She didn’t know I was going to propose that night,” Mosher told WFSB in Hartford, Connecticut. “But I said to myself, she needs to know she’s not going to go down this road alone.” That night, Mosher took Lindsay on a carriage ride and then got down on one knee to pop the question. She said yes. For the next year, the Connecticut couple would receive more bad news than good. Lindsay’s cancer was increasingly aggressive, and in September, they learned it had spread to her brain. Despite the bleak prognosis, Lindsay was determined to make it to her wedding day, set for Dec. 30, 2017. But even as that day drew closer, the doctors told Mosher there might not be enough time. So on Dec. 22 in the hospital chapel, surrounded by family and friends, struggling through her vows due to sheer weakness, Heather married David. Bridesmaid Christina Karas captured this touching image of the bride celebrating with what strength she had left: “We were losing her as we were all standing there,” said Karas. “The last words she spoke were her vows,” the bridesmaid told WFSB. On Dec. 23, 2017, less than a day after fulfilling her dream of marrying David Mosher ― and a year to the day after he proposed to her ― Heather Mosher died. “I saw her in a lot of pain and she didn’t give up until she married me,” David Mosher told NBC Connecticut . “It is so humbling that someone could love me like that.” On Dec. 30, the day Heather Lindsay had planned to get married, she was laid to rest by her husband .",79.9,6.3,8.5,318,318,"mosher

The singer released a nude photo of herself on Twitter on Monday after seeing that someone was attempting to sell the picture to her fans. Sia clearly was not aware of the photo being taken, as it was taken from afar and with her back to the camera. Sia released a screenshot of the “client preview” watermarked photo along with the seller’s (poorly written) offer. “If you make the purchase it will be unblurred and you receive and additional 14 images,” the message reads. Not one to let her fans get swindled, Sia just posted the photo herself for her fans. “Someone is apparently trying to sell naked photos of me to my fans,” Sia wrote. “Save your money, here it is for free. Everyday is Christmas!” HuffPost is displaying only a portion of Sia’s NSFW tweet. This wouldn’t be the first time naked photos of a celebrity were leaked or up for sale. In 2014, a large number of nude images were released of celebrities including Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton in a massive hack of Apple’s iCloud service. Many commenters were unsympathetic to the victims, claiming that women shouldn’t take nude photos if they don’t expect for them to be seen. Lawrence called the situation a violation and a sex crime. “Just the fact that somebody can be sexually exploited and violated, and the first thought that crosses somebody’s mind is to make a profit from it,” Lawrence told Vanity Fair. “It’s so beyond me. I just can’t imagine being that detached from humanity.” Sia quickly earned the overwhelming praise of her fans for being so bold in posting her photos.",72.56,7,8.5,281,281,"sia

According to leaked texts sent and received by his daughter, Andrea Manafort Shand, the two pals were “perfect allies.” The Trump administration has been working overtime to downplay Manafort’s role in last year’s campaign. “Paul Manafort was brought in to lead the delegate process, which he did, and was dismissed not too long after that,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday. “Paul was brought on sometime in June, and by the middle of August he was no longer with the campaign,” then-press secretary Sean Spicer said in March. Spicer’s statement was untrue, and Sanders’ claim was misleading. The public record shows that Manafort, who had known Trump for decades , joined his campaign toward the end of March 2016. And Manafort’s eventual resignation didn’t necessarily indicate he was leaving Trump’s orbit, according to his daughter’s texts. Manafort Shand may have wanted to inflate her father’s role to impress her friends. But even after her father stepped down from the campaign last August , Manafort Shand was under the impression that he had continuing influence within the Trump campaign and beyond. The following texts, sent by Manafort Shand to her sister, Jessica Manafort, and to friends and part of a cache discovered by the website Krypt3ia earlier this year, offer a markedly different understanding of the Trump/Manafort relationship than the president and his allies are attempting to sell. (Manafort previously confirmed the authenticity of several of the other texts to Politico.) The texts have been lightly edited for grammar and clarity. March 17, 2016: The Manafort daughters claim Trump asked their father to run his campaign. Jessica Manafort: Guess who called Dad last night and asked him to run his convention. Andrea Manafort Shand: Mom told me he was going to call dad. She told me to get ready for Trump to be president and pick the position in the White House I want. JM: Dad gave him his list of requirements and so long as he can fulfill the list, Dad accepted. March 29: Even before he was announced as campaign chairman, her father’s role was much larger than the public knew, Manafort Shand claims. Friend: I’m not paying enough attention to really form an opinion. But yea I think economy makes sense, just hate what an asshole [Trump] is in the process. AMS: Well hopefully my dad will help scale that back. That’s part of the reason he was brought on. He is refusing payment. Bc he doesn’t want to be viewed as Trump’s employee. Only having his expenses covered. He is involved purely because he wants to help the country and he thinks trump is best, so long as trump gets trained a bit. PS this is all top secret, so please do not repeat. AMS: Dude he is second in command. Perhaps arguably running it. The campaign manager is all for show. [Corey Lewandowski] doesn’t do shit. Trump has been managing his own campaign April 7: Manafort Shand paints her father as a master manipulator who is a close ally of Trump’s. [ After sending her friend a CNN article hinting at Manafort’s expanded role within the campaign. ] Friend: Is Paul getting a bigger role?! Seems like it ... AMS : You’re surprised?? I told you this was the game. You think Paul does anything in moderation? Friend : And like, if Trump gets elected, guess who’s gonna be chief of staff ... AMS : Phffff. He would never accept. Friend : Too many skeletons in his closet? AMS : Too constrictive. Paul is a lone wolf. Has to go his own way. Do what he wants when he wants how he wants. He doesn’t have room for other people and their needs/wants. Friend : Yea that sounds about right AMS : He likes the challenge. That’s why he’s doing this. It’s a game for him. He isn’t being paid. Friend : Man I bet he’s loving it. AMS : This is pure sport. He is a power hungry egomaniac. Yes. He is loving it. Conclusively. Him and trump are perfect allies for this agenda. It’s so weird he is my dad. [ Later ] AMS : It’s just weird. Like [my dad] doesn’t seem that smart. Like he is smart. But I know I’m smarter than him. Friend : I don’t doubt that, he’s a master manipulator. Which seems pretty key. AMS : He is very manipulative. I did inherit that ability. But I don’t exploit it like he does. I know all his tactics. They aren’t that brilliant but they do work. Friend : But yes you’re right, you have a moral conscious [sic]. AMS : Like he just tells you the sky is green over and over. And eventually you are like is it? I don’t possess the ability to just lie like he does. Friend : Yea he works his charm. AMS : It’s confidence. When you say something unwaveringly, people start to believe it. Friend : I mean yea that got Trump where he is today. AMS : Yup. Perfect allies. Trump probably has more morals than my dad. Which is really just saying something about my dad. My dad is a psycho!!! At least trump let his wives leave him. Plus, Trump has been a good father. AMS : Trump waited a little too long in my opinion, but I can attest to the fact that he has now hired one of the world’s greatest manipulators. I hope my dad pulls it off. Then I can sell my memoir with all his dirty secrets for a pretty penny. [ Later, Manafort Shand talks to another friend about her feelings regarding the campaign. ] AMS : He was brought on to be convention manager, but really it was always to run shit. And now that’s being publicly known. Or acknowledged I guess. [ Later ] JM : Dad and Trump are literally living in the same building and mom says they go up and down all day long hanging and plotting together April 12: Manafort Shand offers campaign-related favors from her father to a friend. AMS : By the way, if you want to exploit my dad to better your career, please let me know. Friend : Are you serious? AMS : Completely. Friend : I wouldn’t be opposed to exploiting him. AMS : I am on a business email basis with my dad. [ Later ] AMS : My dad is Trump’s right-hand man right now and will be through November. But he won’t accept any position in the White House, so his leverage will diminish at that point (assuming Trump wins). April 13: Manafort refused payment as a power play, his daughter claims. AMS : Yup. That’s a match made in heaven. Egomaniacs galore. AMS : But yea [my dad is] super tight with the Trumps. All the kids call him all the time. And him and Trump both live in Trump Tower in NYC. So it’s like a sitcom. Although — top top secret. Can’t repeat, promise? My dad isn’t getting paid for trump. Friend : WHAT, really? AMS : He refused payment. Trump is only covering expenses. Friend : Political favors later? AMS : Eh maybe but the truth of it is, I think there are rules for how much you can pay campaign personnel, so it isn’t much to start with — not to my dad anyway. And my dad wants Trump to listen to him and respect him. View him as an equal, not as staff. So refusing payment makes it so. And makes it clear to Trump why my dad is doing it — because he wants to. AMS : And my dad won’t take an appointment either. Trump knows that, too. So this isn’t for personal gain for my dad, and that’s true — not a game. So why is my dad doing it? Sport. AMS : This is his wheelhouse. And he gets off on power too. My dad loves challenges and this is like a chess game. He got a mistress because he was bored. Trump is his new mistress. May 19: Although her father was never officially co-manager with Lewandowski, Manafort Shand claims that was effectively the case. [ After sending her friend a link to an ABC article about Manafort moving up yet again within the campaign .] AMS : My mom told me they were gonna call them co-managers, and then Corey went to Trump’s son-in-law, Ivanka’s husband, and burst into tears about how that would ruin him. So since my dad doesn’t care about titles, this was the compromise. May 26: Manafort Shand offers campaign-related favors from her father to Lockheed Martin. Friend : Helleeew! I have an awkward favor/question to ask, so if you’re not down, I totally understand. I’m not sure how you and your dad are these days, and I’m gonna guess you’re overloaded with requests to get in touch, but if it’s do-able, could you help me get in touch with or pass on an email to someone in your dads office? AMS : Sure, what’s your end goal? Friend : It’s not an effort to help the campaign. My dad works for Lockheed Martin, and they want to essentially let Trump’s transition team know that they’re ready, available, and happy to provide info about defense acquisition and sustainment. So to discuss policy. But they can’t reach out to Trump’s team — the team would have to reach out to them. So I’ve got an email with info that would be amazing if passed on to the right people. Again — if this is not your cup of tea, totally forget I asked. I’m only asking bc it’s my dad. AMS : I hear ya — it’s not a problem, I just think it’s probably a bit early. But I can ask my mom who the right person would be to receive the email. I would imagine Rick Davis or Rick Gates. But I’ll find out and let you/them know. Friend : Thank you!! I really appreciate it. I think they want to get in front ahead of time instead of play catch up. I feel weird asking for a favor like this haha. AMS : You’re not the first. It’s no bother. I am happy to be a conduit. I just can’t promise anything other than initial access. Friend : Just being a conduit is amazing! Zero expectations, just doin what I can for my dad so anything at all is fucking great. AMS : Totally get it. Not every day you know the man behind the man. Gotta exploit it. Which is why I am happy to help. Cuz fuck it, hopefully someone can benefit by my relation to the count of Monte Cristo. June 20: Manafort had enough sway to pick Trump’s vice president, his daughter claims. AMS : My dad is picking VP. So there’s that. Aug. 17: Trump hires Steve Bannon and promotes Kellyanne Conway . Manafort Shand claims that her father was really the one who hired them and that public perception of his being sidelined is incorrect. AMS : [My dad] hasn’t been demoted. That’s total bullshit. No surprise that the media is wrong. Again. My dad hired those 2 people. Interviewed them in trump towers Aug. 19: Manafort Shand claims that her father’s resignation was merely to appease the public, but that he’s still very much involved. AMS : So I got to the bottom of it. As I suspected, my dad resigned from being the public face of the campaign but is still very much involved behind the scenes. He felt he was becoming a distraction and that would ultimately take a toll on the campaign. Friend : Wow. Well, I’m really glad he’s still part of it. Seriously, who knows what would have happened at the convention if he wasn’t running the show. AMS : Yes for sure. He said that, in the next few weeks, we should hopefully be seeing a new Trump, so to speak. Last night’s speech was a speech my dad had been pushing him to make for several weeks, and since it was so well-received, he thinks Trump will be more responsive to doing things a bit differently. [ Later ] Friend : Thoughts go out to your pops — I can only imagine that he’s relieved, angry, hurting, a combination of a lot of emotions. Wishing you and your fam the best AMS : Hahaha, you’re so silly. It’s all just PR. Paul Manafort, Andrea Manafort Shand and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.",76.72,5.4,8.1,2074,2074,"ams

Once township officials discovered the post, Roysdon was suspended indefinitely , according to local station WHIO-TV. The township will hold a disciplinary hearing for him on Sept. 27, the station reported. Because he is a volunteer, Roysdon is only paid when he is called to duty. Authorities said he will not be called while the suspension is in effect. Township officials released an official statement about Roysdon on Thursday, confirming that he was suspended until the township’s board of trustees can meet to determine his fate: “Recently, a Franklin Township volunteer firefighter posted unacceptable remarks on social media.  Upon gaining knowledge of this information, Fire Chief Steve Bishop immediately contacted the firefighter and directed the comments be removed.  The firefighter was suspended without pay until the Board of Township Trustees could meet to determine a course of action.  Chief Bishop does not have the authority to terminate employees.  Termination of any township employee requires a vote by the Board of Trustees.” HuffPost reached out to Roysdon, who did not immediately respond. A woman who identified herself as Joei Frame Roysdon told WXIX-TV that she was Roysdon’s wife and said, “He admitted that he said things that were wrong and apologized.” She added: “Everyone deserves a second chance and is also entitled to their own opinion.” Meanwhile, Ryan Grubbs, who works as a volunteer firefighter with Roysdon, said his colleague’s words go against the department’s core values. “ We don’t pick and choose who needs us , we just go,” Grubbs told WKEF-TV. “We’re volunteers, we’re doing this because we love the community.”",53,10.4,12.6,346,346,"township

Recipients of the photo confirmed its contents to HuffPost, which is not revealing their identities. The women, who are Bolling’s current and former Fox colleagues, concluded the message was from him because they recognized his number from previous work-related and informal interactions. The messages were sent several years ago, on separate occasions. The women did not solicit the messages, which they told colleagues were deeply upsetting and offensive. One of the recipients said that when she replied to Bolling via text, telling him never to send her such photos again, he did not respond. Four people, outside of the recipients, confirmed to HuffPost they’d seen the photo, and eight others said the recipients had spoken to them about it. For this story, HuffPost spoke to 14 sources in and out of Fox News and Fox Business, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity either because they currently work at the networks and aren’t allowed to speak to members of the press without prior authorization or because they have confidentiality agreements with Fox News and its parent company 21st Century Fox. Over the past year, the network has been rocked by multiple accusations of sexual harassment and assault by Fox News and Fox Business executives and on-air talent. Last year, former Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes resigned after former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson filed a lawsuit accusing him of sexual harassment. Since Ailes was forced out, multiple former and current Fox News hosts have accused him of harassment, including CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota. Last April, after a bombshell New York Times report revealed that Bill O’Reilly had quietly settled multiple sexual harassment suits, the network forced him out. Reached Friday by HuffPost about the accusations against Bolling, a Fox spokesperson said, “We were just informed of this and plan to investigate the matter.” When asked whether Bolling at any point had sent unsolicited lewd or inappropriate text messages or emails (including an image of a man’s genitalia) to Fox News or Fox Business colleagues, his attorney Michael J. Bowe responded, “Mr. Bolling recalls no such inappropriate communications, does not believe he sent any such communications, and will vigorously pursue his legal remedies for any false and defamatory accusations that are made.” Bolling, a former commodities trader, has worked at the Fox News and Fox Business networks since 2007, when he joined after leaving CNBC. He has had a history of making misogynistic on-air remarks during his tenure at Fox News, the most notable during a September 2014 segment on the panel show “The Five” while discussing the first woman fighter pilot from the United Arab Emirates leading the bombing of the Islamic State. Bolling asked on air if instead of saying “boots on the ground” it would be more appropriate to say “boobs on the ground.” He apologized the next day, citing “a look” he got from his wife when he arrived home. The allegations against Bolling recall statements he made attacking Anthony Weiner in 2014, after the former New York congressman had been embroiled in a scandal for sexting several women. During a Twitter war with Weiner, Bolling concluded with a tweet that said: “text us if you want a fair & balanced intv **NO SEFIES PLEASE [sic]**” In May 2017, when Weiner pleaded guilty to federal charges of exchanging lewd messages with an underage girl, Bolling said , “He is a sick human being, to continue to do this time and time again, continue to get caught, saying he’s not going to do it again, gets caught again.” Bolling serves as one of the co-hosts of “The Specialists,” a new program on the Fox News Channel. Previously, he served as one of the hosts of “The Five” and as a fill-in host for O’Reilly and Sean Hannity. After the network fired O’Reilly last April, Fox News announced that Bolling would leave the “The Five” and host another panel program at 5 p.m. with co-hosts Eboni Williams and Katherine Timpf. Bolling’s star at the Fox Networks has risen in the past two years, in part because of his close relationship with and strong support of President Donald Trump. Bolling can often be seen aggressively defending Trump on the network, and his loyalty has been repaid. Over the past few years, Trump has tweeted praise and support for Bolling at least a dozen times, including support for his book in 2016. When “The Specialists” premiered earlier this year, Bolling was granted an exclusive interview with Trump. Fox News recently renewed Bolling’s contract. In a statement in June, Fox News co-president Suzanne Scott said that Bolling’s “ insight is valued, and we are pleased to have him at the network for many more years to come.” The multiyear extension ended speculation that he was going to accept a position in the Trump administration. In an interview with NJ.Com, Bolling said the Trump transition had floated the position of commerce secretary, but he said he would only consider joining as a senior adviser. In the interview, Bolling said he believed he had a future in politics : “ When the lights go down on my TV career, the next step is running for Senate.” Follow Yashar — or send him a tip — on Twitter: @yashar",54.97,11.7,12.6,909,909,"bolling

Scaramucci was named communications director on July 21, a mere 10 days ago. Axios reports he resigned at the request of Gen. John Kelly, the new White House chief of staff. “Mr. Scaramucci felt it was best to give Chief of Staff John Kelly a clean slate and the ability to build his own team,” a statement from the White House press secretary said Monday. “We wish him all the best.” According to CBS and CNN, Scaramucci was escorted from White House grounds Monday. The resignation comes after a controversy-laden week for Scaramucci that included a profanity-laced tirade against other members of President Donald Trump’s White House staff. His rant, published in The New Yorker, was mostly aimed at then-White House chief of staff Reince Priebus. ( Priebus resigned from his post last week and was replaced Monday morning by Kelly.) Scaramucci referred to Priebus as “a fucking paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac.” Scaramucci also gave one of the more memorable quotes so far of the Trump administration during that interview, while arguing that he doesn’t care for media attention. “I’m not Steve Bannon, I’m not trying to suck my own cock,” he said. But that rant wasn’t the only eyebrow-raising moment during his 10 days in the White House. Scaramucci brought on criticism after directing comments about hair and makeup at White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. He also reportedly received divorce papers from his wife, who gave birth to the couple’s son while Scaramucci was with Trump last week. Michael Short, an aide in the White House press office, resigned last week because of pressure from Scaramucci, who had threatened to “fire everybody” in order to stop leaks. Even his hire was laden with controversy. Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer reportedly submitted his resignation after learning Trump was giving Scaramucci a prominent role on the White House communications team. Scaramucci’s short tenure followed that of Mike Dubke, who resigned in May after just three months as White House communications director. Just this morning, Trump assured his Twitter followers there is “No WH chaos!” When asked about Scaramucci’s departure during a White House press briefing Monday afternoon, Sanders confirmed that Scaramucci “does not have a role at this time in the Trump administration,” saying Scaramucci and Kelly came to “a mutual agreement” about Scaramucci’s departure. She would not say if Scaramucci resigned or was fired. Of Kelly, Sanders said, “all staff will report to him.” Sanders also commented on Scaramucci’s interview with The New Yorker, saying Trump found the remarks “inappropriate.” This was a breaking story that has been updated throughout.",62.58,8.8,12.1,445,445,"scaramucci

Earlier this week, Trump said he needed to get all “the facts” before singling out hate groups for condemnation after violent protests sparked by a white supremacist rally left one woman dead in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday. Trump initially posted a measured response to the incident in Barcelona: Less than an hour after his initial tweet, Trump followed up, implying the Barcelona attack was linked to “Radical Islamic Terror”: During the Republican presidential primary race, Trump told crowds a story ― a false one , according to historians ― about John “Black Jack” Pershing, the Army general who commanded U.S. forces in World War I. According to Mother Jones , Trump spoke of Pershing executing Muslim insurgents in the Philippines in the early 1900s with bullets dipped in pig’s blood and eliminating “a problem” for 25 years (unlike the 35 years mentioned in his tweet): He caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage…and he took the 50 terrorists and he took 50 men and dipped 50 bullets in pig’s blood. You heard about that? He took 50 bullets and dipped them in pig’s blood [which is considered haram]. And he has his men load up their rifles and he lined up the 50 people and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said, you go back to your people and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years there wasn’t a problem. After telling that story, Trump claimed “we’ve got to start getting tough and we’ve got to start being vigilant and we’ve got to start using our heads or we’re not gonna have a country, folks.” As Time reported in 2016 , historians know of no evidence to support Trump’s claim. The magazine quoted one saying it would have been “out of character” for Pershing. Trump’s comments on Barcelona came just hours after news broke of the carnage there, which police confirmed they were treating as a terrorist attack. The so-called Islamic State claimed responsibility for the assault via its Amaq news agency, but it’s unclear to what degree the group’s leadership was involved in planning it. White House chief of staff John Kelly briefed Trump on the matter Thursday afternoon. Trump’s quick response sharply contrasts with his reactions to the violence in Charlottesville. Trump argued in his initial response on Saturday that “many sides” were to blame for the tumult, which erupted amid a white supremacist protest against efforts to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. The president didn’t explicitly condemn hate groups until Monday, two days after a car allegedly driven by a white supremacist plowed into a group of counterprotesters, killing a 32-year-old woman . In a rambling press conference Tuesday, Trump defended his initial statement, arguing he needed to get “the facts” before making more definitive remarks against racist groups. “I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct, not make a quick statement. The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement, but you don’t make statements that direct unless you know the facts,” Trump said Tuesday. “It takes a little while to get the facts. You still don’t know the facts. It is a very, very important process to me. It is a very important statement. So I don’t want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement. I want to know the facts.” Trump on Tuesday also again blamed “both sides” for the clashes in Charlottesville. “You had a group on one side that was bad. You had a group on the other side that was also very violent,” Trump said. “Nobody wants to say that. I’ll say it right now.” But Trump has been quick to cite “radical Islamic terrorism” for attacks in the past. It took him less than a day to respond to terrorist attacks in Paris, Manchester, England, and London, the last of which he used as a reason to plug his proposal for a travel ban from several Muslim-majority countries. His rhetoric toward “radical Islam” is often violent and sweeping, unlike his comments on the white supremacist and racist groups who gathered for the rally in Charlottesville, which Trump claimed had some “ fine people .” As Vox has pointed out, Trump has been generally slow to respond to violent incidents where Muslims are the victims. Trump also has claimed he can “predict” terrorism , saying he “can feel it.” After a gunman who claimed allegiance to the Islamic State attacked a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in June 2016, killing 49 and wounding scores more, Trump bragged about “ being right on radical Islamic terrorism .”",67.38,9,11.7,807,807,"trump

The organization, which advocates for indigenous rights, said the massacre included women and children and may have wiped out one-fifth of the tribe. Members of the tribe were gathering eggs along a river in the Javari Valley, in the country’s remote west, when they came across the miners, The New York Times reported. The miners later boasted about the slaughter at a bar in the nearest town and showed off a hand-carved paddle they claimed to have stolen as a trophy. “It was crude bar talk,” Leila Silvia Burger Sotto-Maior, Funai’s coordinator for uncontacted and recently contacted tribes, told the Times. “ They even bragged about cutting up the bodies and throwing them in the river .” Funai is Brazil’s agency for indigenous affairs, and its budget was recently cut under Brazilian President Michel Temer. Survival International described Temer’s government as “fiercely anti-Indian, and has close ties to the country’s powerful and anti-indigenous agribusiness lobby.” Survival International called the attack “genocidal” and said Temer and his government bore “heavy responsibility” for it. According to Stephen Corry, Survival International’s director: “The slashing of Funai’s funds has left dozens of uncontacted tribes defenseless against thousands of invaders ― gold miners, ranchers and loggers ― who are desperate to steal and ransack their lands. All these tribes should have had their lands properly recognized and protected years ago ― the government’s open support for those who want to open up indigenous territories is utterly shameful, and is setting indigenous rights in Brazil back decades.” At least two other tribes in the region have seen their land invaded and are now surrounded by ranchers and others, Survival International reported. Adelson Kora Kanamari, leader of the Warikama Djapar tribe, told the Amazon Real portal that the situation for indigenous people in the region was “very critical” and that 18 to 21 people have been killed in attacks, AFP reported. “ The invaders are landowners, hunters, miners ,” Kanamari said. “Many [indigenous] are being killed in isolation, but we don’t know the exact dates or number of deaths.”",46.61,12.8,13.7,367,367,"indigenous

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said Bannon and Chief of Staff John Kelly agreed Friday would be his last day. “We are grateful for his service and wish him the best,” Sanders said in a statement. The details of Bannon’s departure remain unclear. The New York Times reported Trump had decided to remove Bannon, but also that a source close to Bannon said the adviser had submitted his resignation on Aug. 7 to be effective Aug. 14. MSNBC ’s Stephanie Ruhle also tweeted Bannon is “out.” CNN’s Jim Acosta and Axios’ Jonathan Swan both tweeted Bannon had been fired. Vanity Fair’s Gabriel Sherman tweeted that Bannon was expected to return to Breitbart News , the site espousing white nationalist views that he led before joining Trump’s president campaign. Charlie Spiering, Breitbart’s White House correspondent, said Bannon had returned immediately and chaired an editorial meeting on Friday. Bannon told Bloomberg Businessweek that he is going to fight for Trump “against his opponents ― on Capitol Hill, in the media, and in corporate America.” “If there’s any confusion out there, let me clear it up: I’m leaving the White House and going to war,” he told the outlet. A source close to Bannon told The Atlantic’s Rosie Gray that Bannon is now “fully unchained.” Bannon’s departure comes amid a recent wave of White House staffing shakeups and turmoil. According to Axios , Trump believed that Bannon was behind recent leaks to the press. The president has made stopping leaks a top priority. Backlash over Trump’s response to white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia , may have also led to the departure. Former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci on Sunday blamed Trump’s failure to directly call out far-right groups on Bannon. Scaramucci himself was fired after just 10 days on the job , after he forced out then-chief of staff Reince Priebus . Both Bannon and Priebus had strongly objected to Scaramucci’s hiring, and former press secretary Sean Spicer resigned over it . In a statement, the Democratic National Committee said Bannon’s departure would mean “there is one less white supremacist in the White House, but that doesn’t change the man sitting behind the Resolute desk.” “Donald Trump has spent decades fueling hate in communities, including his recent attempts to divide our country and give a voice to white supremacists,” the group said in a statement. Bannon, who left Breitbart to run Trump’s campaign in August 2016, pushed Trump to be loyal to the populist base that got him elected. He was a conservative force in the West Wing who helped draft Trump’s controversial ban on travel and immigration from several Muslim-majority countries. Bannon was once considered one of the most influential members of Trump’s inner circle, but he has receded from public view in recent months. After his feud with Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, became public earlier this year, Trump urged the two to work it out. Politico also reported Trump was upset over a new book highlighting the importance of Bannon’s role in Trump’s presidential campaign. Bannon also gave a bizarre interview this week to The American Prospect, a progressive publication, calling white supremacists a “collection of clowns” and contradicted Trump’s military threats to North Korea. In April, when Bannon and Kushner feuded, Trump downplayed Bannon’s role during his presidential campaign, portraying him as someone who took over in the homestretch and whom he didn’t know well . Bannon once pledged to fight for the “ deconstruction of the administrative state .” He long assailed establishment Republicans and reportedly called House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) a “limp-dick motherfucker” when there was talk of pushing Ryan to challenge Trump’s claim to the Republican nomination. Progressives long protested Bannon’s elevation to his role as Trump’s chief strategist, citing his offensive views . Following Trump’s apparent refusal to denounce the white nationalist protesters in Charlottesville, they renewed their calls to “fire Bannon.” Leaders of the congressional black, Asian, Hispanic and progressive caucuses also had sent a letter to the White House demanding the dismissal of Bannon along with aides Stephen Miller and Sebastian Gorka, saying their presence in the White House emboldened white supremacists across the country. The letter came after Trump faced criticism for initially condemning “all sides” after the violent protests in Charlottesville. “Americans deserve to know that white nationalists, white supremacists, and neo-Nazis are not in a position to influence U.S. policy,” the letter said. “That is why we continue to find Steve Bannon’s presence in your administration incredibly alarming and dangerous to our nation and the world, and once again, we urge you to immediately remove Steve Bannon from the White House altogether. As you know, Mr. Bannon is the co-founder of the white nationalist, ‘alt-right’ website, Breitbart News. Under his direction and approval, this site published blatantly bigoted rhetoric about women, Muslims, and other minorities. It is no wonder that white nationalist groups, such as the KKK, have praised Mr. Bannon’s extreme political statements.” This article has been updated with more details about Bannon’s departure from the White House and return to Breitbart.",51.78,10.9,13,874,874,"trump

According to police, he traveled to Las Vegas on Thursday, checking into the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. It was from his hotel room on the 32nd floor that, around 10:15 p.m. on Sunday, he fired a fusillade at thousands of people across the street watching a performance by Jason Aldean at the Route 91 Harvest Festival. A SWAT team blew open the entry to Paddock’s hotel room with an explosive and found him dead, police said. Authorities found 23 weapons in the room, including assault-style rifles and some arms that may have been modified in an attempt to convert them into machine guns, Reuters reported. The cache included AR-15-style and AK-47-style rifles and a large amount of ammunition. An additional 19 firearms, explosives and thousands of rounds of ammunition were found at Paddock’s home in Mesquite, totaling 42 weapons in his possession, Reuters reported. Paddock is reported to have smashed hotel windows prior to the shooting with a hammer-like device. A law enforcement official said two rifles with scopes on tripods were found positioned in front of the broken windows. The violence was at odds with how family, friends, and neighbors described Paddock, who police said had no serious criminal record. His brother, Eric Paddock, told reporters that Stephen Paddock was a multimillionaire who invested in real estate and previously worked in accounting. Paddock worked for a predecessor company of Lockheed Martin from 1985 until 1988, the company said. Eric Paddock, who lives in Central Florida, said his brother was retired and described him as “ just a guy ” who frequented Las Vegas hotels, gambled and attended shows. He added that his brother was never violent and had no history of mental illness. He had “no religious affiliation” and “no political affiliation,” he said. Paddock and his three brothers were raised by a single mother who moved the family around the country to places like Iowa and Arizona, another brother, Patrick Paddock II, told The New York Times. The boys’ father, Benjamin Paddock, was a bank robber who made the FBI’s Most Wanted List after breaking out of prison. Their mother told them their father had died, Patrick Paddock said. Stephen “was the least violent in the family during my childhood,” Patrick Paddock said. “So, it’s kind of like, ‘Who?’ Eric Paddock told reporters that his brother had lived in Viera, north of Melbourne, but left Florida in 2015 in pursuit of better weather and more access to gambling. He said he spoke to his brother earlier in the month about how their elderly mother was faring in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. Stephen Paddock gambled more than $10,000 a day numerous times in recent weeks at Las Vegas casinos, according to NBC News, which cited a casino executive and a source who had seen reports to the government on cash transactions. Some of Paddock’s transactions topped $30,000, NBC said. It was unclear whether Paddock was a winner or loser, according to the network. Paddock bought his current residence in Mesquite in 2015, according to USA Today. The Sun City Mesquite senior complex features 1,400 homes, an 18-hole golf course, swimming pools and a recreation center. Paddock lived with his girlfriend, Marilou Danley. Law enforcement initially named her as “a person of interest,” but later said she was not believed to have been involved with the attack , and is currently out of the country. A former Florida neighbor said Paddock described himself as a professional gambler and was “very trusting,” the Palm Beach Post reported. Don Judy recalled how Paddock handed him a house key on their first meeting in 2013, asking him to check on his home and welcoming him to use any new equipment inside. Paddock had also owned rental properties in Southern California and in Texas, the LA Times said. Paddock owned two airplanes and had a private pilot’s license, according to public records. He no history of criminality that would raise red flags, police said. “It’s one of those really sad, tragic things that a man that’s 64 years old that really had no other reason that we can find at least in his history here to go out and wound that many people,” Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said. Paddock had twice been married and divorced, CNN reported , citing court records. His former brother-in-law, Scott Brunoehler, told the Los Angeles Times that he “seemed like a normal, good guy.” Brunoehler said Paddock’s marriage to his sister Sharon ended amicably. Los Angeles Sheriff’s Sgt. Cort Bishop told the Daily Mail that Paddock’s other ex-wife, Peggy Paddock, “hasn’t had any recent contact with him at all.” Two Nevada gun stores told NBC News that they had sold firearms to Paddock within the last year, and that he passed all required background checks. It is unclear if those guns were used in the mass shooting Sunday night. “Mr. Paddock was a customer and purchased firearms from our store; however, all necessary background checks and procedures were followed, as required by local, state, and federal law,” said Christopher Sullivan, the general manager of Guns & Guitars, Inc. “He never gave any indication or reason to believe he was unstable or unfit at any time. We are currently cooperating with the ongoing investigation by local and federal law enforcement in any way we can.” ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack early Monday, but a law enforcement spokesman said in a press conference there is no indication of that.

For over 50 years, a group of intrepid lexicographers have been documenting words like these ― regional terms and phrases that were once popular in states like Wisconsin, Kansas and Tennessee. Collected together in the Dictionary of American Regional English , the words make up a fascinating repository for old-fashioned, funny-sounding and unmistakably local language quirks across the United States. But the six-volume compendium might soon be coming to an end. DARE began with a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor named Frederic Cassidy. In 1962, he became chief editor of a project dedicated to American dialects, and from 1965 to 1970, he oversaw a team of 80 fieldworkers who traveled the country surveying thousands of English speakers and the regional sayings they held dear. From 1970 until 2013, experts in Madison used the massive amounts of survey data gathered to create an impressive, 60,000-entry dictionary now run by people like longtime DARE editors Joan Hall and George Goebel. Existing in both physical and digital form , the dictionary logs words including bluebird weather (in Maryland, it means a brief period of warm weather in autumn) and slushburger (to South Dakotans, a sloppy joe), as well as phrases like “I hope to my die” (used to make a strong assertion in Kentucky) and “inso” (a contraction meaning “Isn’t that so? Don’t you agree?” in Wisconsin). While non-regional slang words spread like wildfire across the internet now , DARE is a lovely reminder that colloquialisms were once ― and still are, in some cases ― bound to the people and places of localized areas. Even if we’ve long forgotten that bizmaroon is a term for a bullfrog, doodinkus means gadget and splo is a stand-in for liquor, they remain a part of our country’s rich oral history. One of the dictionary’s primary functions today is, according to Hall, to combat the idea that language has been “homogenized” by present-day media and a hyperconnected population, and preserve the dialect that sets us all apart along the way. “Language is changing, no doubt about that,” Hall, who’s been with DARE since the 1970s, told HuffPost, “but it doesn’t mean it’s becoming homogenized. If you think about the parts of your vocabulary that have to do with your family and friends and your community ― that have nothing to do with school or newspapers or standardized forms of communication ― you realize a lot of these words are not going to change because they are part and parcel of our human lives.” And Hall’s not alone in her thinking. Bert Vaux, one of the linguistic professors behind a viral New York Times quiz adapted from the Harvard Dialect Survey he developed, claims that while it might be true that “traditional features of non-standard dialects are dying out, regional differences in vocabulary and pronunciation remain alive and well, and may even be increasing.” He cited the many, many enduring synonyms for “doodlebug,” a term he and other Houston-area natives use to refer to what others call a pill bug, roly poly, sow bug, potato bug, armadillo bug, slater, woody wig or monkey pea as evidence. Hall similarly offers the word “budge,” a relatively new Wisconsin term used in schools to denote cutting or butting in line, as in: “No budging, I was here first!” Unfortunately, there are few resources other than DARE and projects like Vaux’s Cambridge Online Survey of World Englishes that are taking the time to not only track new regionalisms across the U.S., but safeguard the local words and phrases whose usage is dwindling ― from Gullah words on the southern coasts to Mormon and Amish sayings in the heartland to Spanish-infused speech in the American Southwest. Due to lack of funding , Hall says that DARE will be winding down its services by the end of the year. Any future funding ― be it from federal agencies like the National Endowment for the Humanities or private foundations like the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation ― will be used to continue to update the digital version of DARE, but the organization will cease plans to continue its fieldwork and in-person research. What will be lost if DARE discontinues its research? “We’d be losing an excellent resource for discovering things about our past,” Hall, who’s been technically retired for two years, said. “It’s a hugely important resource for history of the language in this country. It’s also very important for discovering differences among ethnic cultures. We have an index where you can look up Norwegian or Swedish or Spanish or French and find all the entries that say something about that in their etymologies, or you can look and see which entries were used primarily by rural people as opposed to urban, or well-educated as opposed to poorly educated, men and women. These are things that other resources don’t tell you about.” Vaux agrees that nuanced data like that provided by DARE “can play significant roles in combating prejudices by making the general public aware of the sorts of variations that exist in our language and the fact that they typically result not from differences in intelligence or sophistication, but often are simply regional differences.” For West Virginia–based writer Scott McClanahan, author of Crapalachia and The Sarah Book , a focus on dialect differences is certainly complex. “It’s easier to take a people’s natural [and] mineral resources as a society if you think they talk funny,” he explained. “It’s easier to stereotype and exploit a people who are seen as uneducated because they pronounce the word ‘pin’ the same as the word ‘pen.’” McClanahan, whose books explore the people and things that make rural Appalachia tick, says his children won’t sound the way he sounds or use the words he uses, and he doesn’t think they should. “The way their great-grandparents sounded or the words they used would probably be shocking to their ears,” he said. “But inside of all our words are these secret little histories about war and famine and immigration and jobs our ancestors had.” At the end of the day, Vaux believes that regionalism will persist “as long as it is important for humans to identify in-group and out-group status,” he concluded. “I don’t think that language as a whole will homogenize.” Hall doesn’t think it will either, though she’s not relying on blind hope. “As an editor of DARE, I regret that many words seem to be on their way out, because they are interesting, appropriate and reflective of their regions,” she said. “But I also recognize that language change is inevitable, and nothing DARE or anyone else can do will keep them alive if they no longer serve their purpose.” For more information on DARE’s recent efforts ― such as its digitization of more than 1,800 recordings of regional pronunciation ― you can visit the dictionary’s website .

In 1962, he became chief editor of a project dedicated to American dialects, and from 1965 to 1970, he oversaw a team of 80 fieldworkers who traveled the country surveying thousands of English speakers and the regional sayings they held dear.
From 1970 until 2013, experts in Madison used the massive amounts of survey data gathered to create an impressive, 60,000-entry dictionary now run by people like longtime DARE editors Joan Hall and George Goebel.
“Language is changing, no doubt about that,” Hall, who’s been with DARE since the 1970s, told HuffPost, “but it doesn’t mean it’s becoming homogenized.

The acrimony first surfaced during the presidential transition. The two men had been cordial before then. They met six years ago, when Scaramucci was a fundraiser for presidential candidate Mitt Romney and Priebus was chair of the Republican National Committee. They interacted peaceably during Donald Trump ’s campaign as Scaramucci made the rounds on television and at donor events. After Trump’s victory, Priebus was named chief of staff, and Scaramucci, according to someone close to the transition, was assured that he was also in line for a big position within the administration. (Sources for this story requested anonymity to discuss the details of sensitive conversations.) While preparing for his move into government, Scaramucci struck a deal — which is still under regulatory scrutiny — to sell his stake in his hedge fund, SkyBridge Capital, to Chinese conglomerate HNA Group and another company. He assumed that he’d be put in charge of the public liaison office, a job that Valerie Jarrett held in the Obama administration. He had it all mapped out, according to the White House adviser. He identified 2,500 influential business leaders across the United States and had come up with a clever name for them: Trump Team 2,500. He believed these people would help pressure Congress into supporting the president’s agenda. But Scaramucci’s plans were foiled in early January. That’s when Priebus, according to a confidant of both Scaramucci and the president, told Trump, “He played you.” “How’s that?” Trump asked Priebus, according to the same source, who has spoken to several people within the White House about the conversation. Priebus then told Trump that he felt Scaramucci had been offered too much for SkyBridge by HNA Group. The deal, he implied, smelled bad — as if the Chinese might expect favors from within the administration for that inflated price. The source also said that Priebus mentioned there was email traffic between Scaramucci and the Chinese proving this. The White House rejected this version of events and declined to make Priebus available for comment. Ultimately, Scaramucci was not offered the job. But he didn’t give up. He asked Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner to get him in the door. According to two people familiar with the conversation, Kushner assured him that he didn’t think Scaramucci was “shady,” adding, “But it’s not what I think that matters.” Priebus had already planted the seed of doubt in Trump’s mind . Scaramucci then tried presidential adviser Steve Bannon, who, according to those same two people, explained that he was too busy attempting to save the job of another adviser, Stephen Miller, to spend time or capital trying to help Scaramucci. A friend of Scaramucci’s said he complained that some in the White House assumed his finances were suspect because he’s of Italian descent. Scaramucci also took Priebus’ behavior as a sign that Priebus was feeling insecure about his own job. “I will try things the Washington way first,” Trump had told his inner circle when he first named Priebus chief of staff, according to the confidant of Scaramucci and Trump. The implication was clear: If the Washington way did not work, then the New York real estate way would take over. Finally, Scaramucci went to Keith Schiller, the president’s longtime bodyguard. He asked Schiller to put him on the phone with Trump so that he could lodge his complaints directly. The president listened, according to their mutual friend, and said he would find a position for Scaramucci as soon as he could. In June, Scaramucci was appointed to be senior vice president and chief strategy officer of the Export-Import Bank. But the Priebus incident lingered in his mind. So, on July 11, when Donald Trump Jr. found himself in trouble for holding a meeting with several people close to the Russian government the previous summer, Scaramucci sensed an opportunity. According to the mutual friend, Scaramucci told everyone he spoke to that day, including the president, that he was sure the person who divulged details of the meeting was Priebus. Scaramucci made the case — not necessarily backed by evidence — that with all the leaks targeting the administration, it was odd that only a few had hit Priebus directly. Ten days later, Scaramucci was named the new White House communications director. The announcement noted that he would be reporting directly to the president — an unusual move that leapfrogged over the chief of staff. Priebus balked, insisting that Scaramucci report to him. But Trump overrode his chief of staff. Not only was the hedge fund manager who had known Trump for 21 years officially in charge of the press shop, but he was also set to oversee the reorganization of the White House. Scaramucci seemed to have his revenge. At least until Thursday evening. In an interview with The New Yorker , Scaramucci called Priebus “a fucking paranoid schizophrenic” and explained how he, unlike Bannon, is “not trying to suck my own cock.” Now, Scaramucci’s future at the White House is less clear, even if Trump reportedly “ loved ” the outburst. Two sources close to the president said the very traits that have so endeared Scaramucci to Trump — tenacity, frankness, limitless swagger — could end up endangering his new job if he continues to steal news cycles from the president. But those same sources said he’s safe for now. “Mark my words: Anthony will ultimately be an exceptionally good communications director,” said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump aide who still talks to the president. “His career proves he’s a master communicator. I hope he keeps his perfect chin up.” On Friday, the news broke that Priebus had been ousted as chief of staff. The story has been updated to remove a reference to a lawyer whom Scaramucci and Kushner share, as Scaramucci hired that attorney before he was first turned down for a job in the administration.",61.06,9.4,12.8,1021,1021,"scaramucci

time","In the public feud between Anthony Scaramucci and Reince Priebus , what hasn’t been fully explained is why Scaramucci so dislikes the president’s now-former chief of staff — a man he alternates between calling “Reince Penis” and “Rancid Penis,” according to an adviser to the White House.
After Trump’s victory, Priebus was named chief of staff, and Scaramucci, according to someone close to the transition, was assured that he was also in line for a big position within the administration.
(Sources for this story requested anonymity to discuss the details of sensitive conversations.) While preparing for his move into government, Scaramucci struck a deal — which is still under regulatory scrutiny — to sell his stake in his hedge fund, SkyBridge Capital, to Chinese conglomerate HNA Group and another company.
That’s when Priebus, according to a confidant of both Scaramucci and the president, told Trump, “He played you.” “How’s that?” Trump asked Priebus, according to the same source, who has spoken to several people within the White House about the conversation.
Priebus then told Trump that he felt Scaramucci had been offered too much for SkyBridge by HNA Group.
The source also said that Priebus mentioned there was email traffic between Scaramucci and the Chinese proving this.
According to two people familiar with the conversation, Kushner assured him that he didn’t think Scaramucci was “shady,” adding, “But it’s not what I think that matters.” Priebus had already planted the seed of doubt in Trump’s mind .
Scaramucci then tried presidential adviser Steve Bannon, who, according to those same two people, explained that he was too busy attempting to save the job of another adviser, Stephen Miller, to spend time or capital trying to help Scaramucci.
A friend of Scaramucci’s said he complained that some in the White House assumed his finances were suspect because he’s of Italian descent.
“I will try things the Washington way first,” Trump had told his inner circle when he first named Priebus chief of staff, according to the confidant of Scaramucci and Trump.
The president listened, according to their mutual friend, and said he would find a position for Scaramucci as soon as he could.
According to the mutual friend, Scaramucci told everyone he spoke to that day, including the president, that he was sure the person who divulged details of the meeting was Priebus.
Ten days later, Scaramucci was named the new White House communications director.
In an interview with The New Yorker , Scaramucci called Priebus “a fucking paranoid schizophrenic” and explained how he, unlike Bannon, is “not trying to suck my own cock.” Now, Scaramucci’s future at the White House is less clear, even if Trump reportedly “ loved ” the outburst."

The photo is captioned: “Winning.” Journalists and commentators swiftly responded on Twitter, blasting the president for once again stoking violent aggression toward the media ― something that has become one of Trump’s favorite pastimes. The image was originally shared Saturday afternoon by a Twitter account named “oregon4TRUMP” in response to a tweet from the president bragging about the accomplishments of his first year in office. “The Stock Market is setting record after record and unemployment is at a 17 year low,” Trump tweeted on Saturday. “So many things accomplished by the Trump Administration, perhaps more than any other President in first year. Sadly, will never be reported correctly by the Fake News Media!” After lashing out in a tweet against the second highest-ranking FBI official on Sunday, the president then retweeted the doctored image of himself with the blood-splattered CNN logo. He subsequently tweeted his rage against “fake news,” as he has on many occasions before. “CNN-labeled blood on the sole of his shoe. Retweeted by the President of the United States on Christmas Eve,” CNN anchor Jake Tapper said on Twitter about the retweet. Jason Osborne, a former adviser for the Trump campaign, responded to Tapper by claiming the blood splatter looked like a squashed bug, while accusing the journalist of stirring controversy. But Tapper wasn’t the only journalist who saw the bloody CNN logo, nor the implications of the retweet. Walter Shaub, former director of the United States Office of Government Ethics, denounced the president’s post, calling Trump a “wannabe autocrat.”  National security lawyer Bradley Moss noted that many journalists risk their lives reporting from war-torn regions of the globe. One report by the Committee to Protect Journalists estimates that at least 42 journalists from different countries around the world were killed while reporting in 2017. Another group, Reporters Without Borders, says as many as 65 journalists have been killed this year. Trump has promoted attacks against journalists in the past. His raucous presidential campaign rallies frequently featured calls inciting violence against reporters and others . In July, the president tweeted a video that showed him beating up a man with a CNN logo as his head. The video appeared to be a repurposed clip of Trump , then a reality TV star, beating up WWE owner Vince McMahon in 2007 ― whose head was replaced with the outlet’s logo. In August, the president shared ― and later deleted ― a tweet that featured a cartoon “Trump train” running over a man with a CNN logo superimposed over his face.",50.77,11.2,12.8,449,449,"trump retweeted

(Story continues below image.) John Mausling and his wife, Jessica Martinez-Mausling, told HuffPost via email that there were no young girls in their 11-member party or on the tour. “At first we tried to be logical and think we somehow missed her so we asked our kids, their girlfriends and our friend if they remembered seeing a little girl,” they wrote. “Nobody did. We do not remember seeing anything on the stairs when we took the picture.” Here’s a close up of the mysterious figure on the stairs: Ben Hansen , former FBI agent and host of “ Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files ,” said a careful analysis of the photo turned up no obvious signs of trickery. “I really like this photo,” Hansen said. “Assuming that it’s not doctored, it ranks up there as one of the best photos of possible paranormal evidence I’ve seen. If it is faked, I’ve got to hand it to them for their level of detail and creativity because there’s usually enough easy signs to suggest hoaxing.” While the ghostly girl stood out the most, the photo may also feature a second apparition. The Mauslings said that at the time the photo was taken, there were just two people on the stairs: the tour guide and someone else on the tour with a cellphone. However, the image shows what could be a third figure, who appears to be walking up the stairs and away from the tour group: Hansen said he assumed this figure was just another person walking up the stairs with the same motion blur seen around some of the other people in the image. Then he noticed something else. “Through the stair railing posts you should see the lower half of this person like you do the tour guide and the shoes of the person on the stairs... but I can’t make out any lower half,” he said. Hansen added there was no litmus test for a ghost photo so it’s impossible to know for sure just what was in the picture. The Mauslings, for their part, said they don’t necessarily believe in ghosts, but were “open-minded” and didn’t discount that they could exist. While the Stanley Hotel is a top destination for people who want to visit nearby Rocky Mountain National Park , it’s also a hot spot for those hoping to have a more otherworldly experience. Last year, a photo of a supposed ghost at the hotel made headlines around the world. That photo was snapped in what appeared to be the same location: After a 1974 stay at the hotel, King called it “the perfect ― maybe the archetypical ― setting for a ghost story.” King wrote on his official website that he and his wife, author Tabitha King, were the only guests when the hotel was about to close for the winter. “That night I dreamed of my three-year-old son running through the corridors, looking back over his shoulder, eyes wide, screaming. He was being chased by a fire-hose. I woke up with a tremendous jerk, sweating all over, within an inch of falling out of bed. I got up, lit a cigarette, sat in the chair looking out the window at the Rockies, and by the time the cigarette was done, I had the bones of the book firmly set in my mind .” That dream became King’s third book, 1977′s “The Shining,” which was set at the haunted Overlook Hotel. In 2014, the book was named King’s third-best novel of all time in a Rolling Stone poll.",73.71,8.6,9.7,661,661,"king

After taking off at 11:36 a.m. PST, the plane returned to Los Angeles International Airport at 7:33 p.m. PST. The confusion was sparked by two brothers who booked tickets on separate flights from Los Angeles to Tokyo, a government source confirmed to HuffPost following a CNN report Wednesday afternoon. One of the flights was serviced by United Airlines and the other by All Nippon. They were scheduled, however, around the same time. Complicating matters further, the two airlines have a codeshare agreement, which allows one carrier to sell seats on a flight operated by another carrier. Precisely how airline personnel allowed the brothers to board the same All Nippon flight is still unknown. Both men passed through the TSA security checkpoint without issue. Some details on the mix-up became clear as the plane flew over the Pacific Ocean. Teigen said that All Nippon flight attendants told her the displaced passenger had a United Airlines boarding pass. “So basically the boarding pass scanner is just a beedoop machine that makes beedoop noises that register to nowhere,” she joked. A spokesperson for All Nippon told HuffPost in a statement that the cabin crew “became aware that one of the passengers boarded the incorrect flight and notified the pilot,” who then made the “correct decision” to turn around “out of the abundance of caution and safety for the passengers and crew onboard.” The airline said the plane returned to Los Angeles in accordance with its security protocol. Flight 175 was carrying 226 passengers, CNN reported . The carrier said it was “researching the situation currently to determine how the passenger boarded the flight.” “[All Nippon Airways] would like to express its apologies to the passengers for the inconvenience. We take great pride providing exemplary customer service, and on this flight we failed to do so,” the statement concluded. (HuffPost reached out to United for comment but has not yet received a response.) As Teigen’s flight saga continued into Tuesday afternoon, she kept her Twitter followers updated. The plane was taken to a secure area of the LAX runway following its return to the airport, she said . Teigen noted that authorities questioned certain passengers before allowing them to deplane. A government source told HuffPost the two brothers were among those questioned, and they were released without issue. Eventually, Teigen and Legend deplaned and went to an airline lounge. While waiting, Teigen took solace in an episode of “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” and ate a bowl of ramen. Investigators have yet to determine how one of the brothers boarded the wrong plane. But one thing is for sure: Teigen is on the case. Hours after their scheduled takeoff, Teigen and Legend boarded another flight to Tokyo, thus continuing an already exhausting journey.

Politico reported Thursday that Andy Hemming resigned from his position as the White House communications team’s director of rapid response on Monday. The 31-year-old former Republican National Committee staffer, who was profiled by Politico’s Annie Karni this month, was responsible for finding positive mainstream media news stories about the Trump administration and recirculating those reports to key reporters and talking heads. Hemming’s goal was to ultimately create more mainstream coverage about positive moments for the Trump administration on the very networks the president routinely bashes and refers to as “fake news,” according to Karni’s piece. Every presidential administration has staffers dedicated to monitoring the press and pushing out stories related to favorable moments. But Trump’s relationship with the press and responses to news coverage is unprecedented. For instance, Vice News reported this month that the president receives a folder filled with positive news about himself twice a day ― a report previous presidents apparently did not receive. Hemming’s role in the administration was a bizarre one, considering his boss regularly picks public feuds with journalists and mainstream news outlets he was required to target with positive stories. Just this week, Trump spent a considerable amount of time trashing the media during his campaign rally in Phoenix a rant that resulted in the crowd chanting “CNN sucks.” Hemming has not publicly commented on his exit, but a White House source told CNN that the decision to part ways was mutual. The departure is the latest in a summer filled with staff shake-ups. In July, press secretary Sean Spicer resigned just before communications director Anthony Scaramucci was hired . Then Reince Priebus left his position as White House chief of staff, days before Scaramucci was shown to the door . Last week, Steve Bannon stepped down as White House chief strategist. Meanwhile, several Trump administration advisers have parted ways with the president over his controversial response to a violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, this month.",40.28,13.2,14.8,336,336,"news stories

MILD SPOILER ALERT: “The Last Jedi” shows the character in hiding, and Hamill appeared to take issue with that. “I said to Rian, I said ‘Jedis don’t give up.’ I mean, even if he had a problem, he would maybe take a year to try and regroup, but if he made a mistake he would try and right that wrong, so right there, we had a fundamental difference, but, it’s not my story anymore,” Hamill, 66, said in an interview posted by Spanish-language movie site SensaCine recently. “It’s somebody else’s story, and Rian needed me to be a certain way to make the ending effective.” Hamill added: “I almost had to think of Luke as another character.

On June 24, Kardashian posted a photo of her 18-month old son Saint sitting in a car seat. While many commenters cooed over how adorable he is, others expressed concerns about the safety of his front-facing car seat. “He is so cute let’s protect this handsome boy by making sure [he] is rear facing,” wrote one Facebook user. “It’s illegal to have a child facing forward in California that is less than 2 years old. Please turn his car seat around, it’s not too late!” added another. On August 10, Kardashian posted a YouTube video to address the criticism with some “Facts.” “They say for his age, he should be rear-facing, but what people didn’t know is that Saint is now the weight and the height requirement to sit forward-facing,” the reality star explained. “Saint actually weighs more than North.” Indeed, The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children remain rear-facing in their car seats until they reach the age of 2 or until they reach the maximum height and weight for their seat. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration suggests that little ones can switch from rear-facing to front-facing when they’re between 1 and 3 years old, depending on their height and weight. Individual states also have laws about car seat safety. Though Kardashian did not specify where the photo was taken, California law also mandates that children under 2 must ride in rear-facing car seats unless the child weighs 40 or more pounds or is 40 or more inches tall. As the California Highway Patrol website notes , “The child shall be secured in a manner that complies with the height and weight limits specified by the manufacturer of the car seat.” Saint’s car seat has been identified as the Maxi-Cosi Pria 70 , which has the same 40 pounds and 40 inches limitation for rear-facing placement.",68.3,8.7,11.6,336,336,"facing

But, as pointed out by Vogue, it was actually a very big deal that the foursome was traveling together. According to BBC, it’s protocol that heirs to the throne not travel together, which means that Prince William and Prince George shouldn’t be on the same plane. The reason being that in case of a serious accident, the lineage to the throne needs to remain intact. But it turns out getting around the protocol is easy, as Prince William can simply ask the queen for permission and she can give her blessing for the family to travel together. Prince William previously asked for permission when he took Prince George on his trip to Australia and New Zealand. “While there is no official rule on this, and royal heirs have travelled together in the past, it is something that the queen has the final say on,” the royal press office said in a statement to BBC’s Newsround show at the time. The entire family has traveled together to Canada before and, of course, their recent trip to Poland and Germany. And to think that if they obeyed royal protocol, we wouldn’t have all these cute photos ! Thank goodness Prince William is an (unofficial) rule breaker.",64.64,10.1,11.4,234,234,"prince

Cory Booker (D-N.J.) is calling on President Donald Trump to resign over the more than a dozen sexual misconduct allegations against him. Booker made the comments Saturday during a campaign event in Alabama to support Doug Jones, the state’s Democratic candidate for Senate. Jones is engaged in a tight race against embattled Republican candidate Roy Moore, whose campaign has been dogged by sexual misconduct accusations. Booker told VICE News that the sexual harassment allegations against Trump are “far more damning” than the claims against Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), who on Thursday announced his resignation from office after multiple women accused him of groping them. “I just watched Al Franken do the honorable thing and resign,” Booker said. “My question is — why isn’t Donald Trump doing the same thing? Who has more serious allegations against him, with more women who have come forward.” While Trump has been quick to call out other high-profile men accused of sexual misconduct in recent weeks, including Franken and Matt Lauer, who was fired from NBC’s “Today” show over sexual assault allegations, he’s refrained from applying the same level of scrutiny to his own behavior. At least 19 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct, including forcible kissing and groping, since the 1980s. He even bragged about grabbing women “by the pussy” on the now-infamous 2005 “Access Hollywood” tape. Trump denied the allegations throughout his 2016 presidential campaign and dismissed the “Access Hollywood” recording as merely “locker room talk.” In October, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders suggested all the women accusing Trump of sexual harassment were lying. Booker’s comments follow a call by Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) that Trump should resign. “The president should resign because he certainly has a track record with more than 17 women of horrific conduct,” Merkley said on Thursday . Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) tweeted on Thursday that Trump should “think about resigning,” a point he reiterated on Sunday during NBC’s “Meet The Press.” As lawmakers push for Trump’s record of alleged sexual misconduct to be re-examined, the president is working to get Moore elected in the Alabama Senate race. Despite his swift condemnation of Franken, Trump has endorsed Moore, a man accused of making sexual advances toward teenagers when he was in his 30s decades ago. “We cannot afford, this country, the future of this country, cannot afford to lose a seat in the very, very close United States Senate,” Trump told a crowd Friday at a rally in Florida near the Alabama border. “Get out and vote for Roy Moore!”",62.68,8.7,12.1,424,424,"trump

Posing on the cover of the Thursday section was Jessica Chastain (“Mollie’s Game”), Margot Robbie (“I, Tonya”), Diane Kruger (“In the Fade”), Saoirse Ronan (“Lady Bird”), Annette Bening (“Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool”) and Kate Winslet (“Wonder Wheel”). All but Kruger are considered to be in the running for lead actress Oscar nominations for 2018 . Except for Chastain, all are blond. Fordham English professor Scott Poulson-Bryant suggested that the Times look up the word “irony.” He quipped that Chastain, with her red hair, must have been the “diversity offering.” There are lots of other “top actresses” the newspaper could have included. Even If the Times was just focusing on award contenders, there were several options. Chilean transgender actress Daniela Vega (“A Fantastic Woman”) and Salma Hayek (“Beatriz at Dinner”) are also both considered contenders for lead actress Oscar nominations. And supporting actress contenders include Octavia Spencer (“The Shape of Water”), Hong Chau (“Downsizing”), Mary J. Blige (“Mudbound”) and Tiffany Haddish (“Girls Trip”), all of whom could have added some color contrast. But Twitter users weren’t upset just with the newspaper; they were especially upset with the women who posed for the cover shoot for not speaking up. Writer and WNYC radio producer Rebecca Carroll called out Chastain, who has spoken up for the rights of minority women. “Honestly @jes_chastain as an outspoken voice for equality how do you pose for a photo like this and not feel absolutely mortified by the blatant exclusion?” Carroll called the purported “shift in focus” touted by the Times actually the “antithesis of a shift in focus — this is literally The Same Focus on White Women in Hollywood.” She also scoffed at calling this group of actresses the “agent for change,” when it was black women who defeated Roy Moore in the Alabama special Senate election. Chastain hasn’t responded to Carroll’s criticism. Ironically, one of the actress’s recent tweets refers to a New York Times story on “forgotten” women, many of them minorities, who continue to be sexually harassed at Ford Motor plants.",58.62,10.3,12.9,420,420,"actress

Having passed tax cuts that provide modest help to most Americans, Trump and GOP leaders are finding that most Americans just don’t believe it. A CNN poll earlier this month found that only 21 percent of respondents believed they would be better off under the tax plan, while 37 percent believed they would be worse off. Another 36 percent thought they would not be affected much either way. In reality – at least until the individual tax cuts expire at the end of 2025 – the vast majority of families will benefit from the cuts, although not necessarily that much for the typical middle-income family. While the overall benefits skew toward the wealthy because of the dramatic 40-percent reduction in the corporate income tax rate, some 80 percent of taxpayers will see a tax reduction next year, according to the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, while 5 percent will get a tax increase and the remainder will see little difference. That disconnect is not surprising to Neil Newhouse, a prominent Republican pollster. “The data you’re seeing is measuring voter reaction to the Trump-GOP tax plan, and neither of those brands is scoring particularly well right now,” Newhouse said. “Voters are responding less to what’s actually in the tax plan and more to who’s taking credit for it.” Trump ― as he has done regularly whenever confronted with news he does not like ― blamed the media for the plan’s unpopularity. “The Massive Tax Cuts, which the Fake News Media is desperate to write badly about so as to please their Democrat bosses, will soon be kicking in and will speak for themselves,” the president tweeted on Thursday. “Companies are already making big payments to workers. Dems want to raise taxes, hate these big Cuts!” Many Republicans agree with Trump that the news media have emphasized how much the tax plan will benefit the wealthy – including Trump himself – but failed to point out that the typical middle-class family would also benefit by about $78 per month. “Republicans are correct to assume that the bill will become more popular when people see it in their paychecks,” said Rory Cooper, once a top aide to former Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. But Cooper and others acknowledge that some of the public’s skepticism is based on Trump’s apparent inability or unwillingness to communicate truthfully – a trait that has extended to the tax cut bill as well. On Wednesday, for instance, on a day that Trump might have simply stated the facts about the bill’s final passage and the benefits it contained, he instead decided to embellish, so that the first three statements he made about the bill were all untrue. Trump claimed that tax legislation “really hasn’t been done” before – which was false. He then claimed that the bill was “the largest tax cut in the history of our country” – which was also false. And then he claimed that the tax cuts for individuals totaled $3.2 trillion – which is not remotely close to true. The bill cuts taxes in all by about $1.8 trillion over 10 years, of which $1.2 trillion goes to individuals and households. “Completely unnecessary,” said Republican political consultant Rick Tyler about Trump’s string of falsehoods. “He thinks that just because he says something, people will believe it. He probably believes it. Because he exhibits all the symptoms of a pathological liar.” Tyler, like most Republicans, supports the tax cuts. He argues that the wealthy pay most of the federal taxes that are collected, so it’s not unreasonable to see them benefit the most from a tax cut. “I think the administration and the Republicans made a communications error by saying it’s going to be a huge break for the middle class,” Tyler said, adding that families will be able to make their own decision about the law once they start seeing changes in their paychecks. But Republicans counting on the tax cuts to give them a big political boost come next Election Day may be in for a disappointment. President George W. Bush’s 2001 tax cuts were larger than the ones just passed, and even included $600 “rebate” checks mailed to taxpayers. Yet just two years later, only 19 percent of Americans believed their taxes had gone down, while 32 percent believed their taxes had risen. President Barack Obama and a Democratic Congress passed a payroll tax cut in 2010 that saved the typical family $1,000 through reduced payroll deductions. Voters again did not seem to notice it, and believed their taxes had gone up. Whether Trump’s tax cuts are viewed the same way remains to be seen, said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll. “Does this help him or not? We’re going to find out,” Brown said. “If people start seeing their paychecks start getting bigger, and they make the connection between their paychecks and Trump’s policies, that would be good for Trump.”",58.92,10.2,12.5,848,848,"taxes

companies","WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump ’s falsehood-rich style appears to have come back to bite him as he brags about his only major legislative accomplishment.
Having passed tax cuts that provide modest help to most Americans, Trump and GOP leaders are finding that most Americans just don’t believe it.
“The data you’re seeing is measuring voter reaction to the Trump-GOP tax plan, and neither of those brands is scoring particularly well right now,” Newhouse said.
“The Massive Tax Cuts, which the Fake News Media is desperate to write badly about so as to please their Democrat bosses, will soon be kicking in and will speak for themselves,” the president tweeted on Thursday.

The officer reportedly fired at the pajama-clad victim from inside a police cruiser while she addressed his partner through the driver’s window. Justine Ruszczyk, 40, was killed after she called 911 to report what she thought was a possible assault on her street, her fiancé confirmed Monday. It appears she most frequently went by the name Justine Damond, even though she was not yet legally married to fiancé Don Damond, 50. The couple had planned to get married in August , according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune. Shown below are Justine Damond, Don Damond and Don’s son Zach Damond. Don Damond mourned the loss of his fiancée in a statement Monday afternoon and criticized the police for not being more forthcoming with information surrounding her death. “Our hearts are broken and we’re utterly devastated by the loss of Justine,” he said, describing his fiancee as “a teacher to so many in living a life of openness, love and kindness.” “She was so kind and so darned funny,” Damond said while holding back tears. “We’re desperate for information. Piecing together Justine’s last moments before the homicide would be a small comfort.” The Hennepin County Medical Examiner announced Monday that Justine Damond died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen and described her death as a homicide. Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it would provide consular assistance to the victim’s family, and released a brief statement on behalf of relatives. “This is a very difficult time for our family,” the statement says. “We are trying to come to terms with this tragedy and to understand why this has happened.” Justine Damond’s father, John Ruszczyk, addressed her death in a statement to Australian media on Tuesday. “We thought yesterday was our worst nightmare, but we awoke to the ugly truth and it hurt even more,” he said. “Justine was a beacon to all of us, we only ask that the light of justice shine down on the circumstances of her death.” Zach Damond, 22, who identified himself as the slain woman’s future stepson, said in a video posted to Facebook that she was killed after calling 911 to report a sound in the alley behind her home. Justine Damond went outside in her pajamas to talk to the officers when they arrived to investigate about 11:30 p.m. She was reportedly speaking to police from outside the driver’s door when the officer in the passenger seat pulled his gun and shot through the driver’s side door, striking Damond, sources familiar with the incident told the Star Tribune . No weapon was found at the scene. The officer who fired has been identified as Mohammed Noor, the first Somali-American officer to join the Minneapolis Police Department’s 5th Precinct team, according to local CBS affiliate WCCO . City records show Noor had three complaints on file, according to local ABC affiliate KSTP. One complaint against him was dismissed with no disciplinary action, though two remain open. “Officer Noor extends his condolences to the family and anyone else who has been touched by this event,” Tom Plunkett, Noor’s attorney, said in a statement Monday. “He came to the United States at a young age and is thankful to have had so many opportunities. He takes these events very seriously because, for him, being a police officer is a calling.” “The current environment for police is difficult, but Officer Noor accepts this as part of his calling,” the statement continued. Zach Damond reacted to the incident in a video posted to the Facebook page for Women’s March Minnesota. “Basically my mom’s dead because a police officer shot her for reasons I don’t know,” he says in the video. “I demand answers. If anybody can help, just call police and demand answers. I’m so done with all this violence.” Minneapolis police faced intense pressure after authorities admitted there was no video footage from the officers’ body cameras. The state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which was leading the investigation, said body cameras worn by the officers were “ not turned on at the time and the squad camera did not capture the incident.” The agency said it was seeking any other video that may have been taken. Since 2016, Minneapolis has required all officers to wear and activate body cameras “at all times when they could reasonably anticipate that they may become involved in a situation for which activation is appropriate.” The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension “will provide additional details of the incident once initial interviews with the officers are complete,” the agency said in a statement Monday. “Those interviews have been requested by BCA agents. The officers are working with their attorneys to schedule them.” Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges said she had “questions about why the bodycams weren’t on” and was “ heartsick and deeply disturbed by what occurred.” “There are still many questions about what took place, and while the investigation is still in its early stages, I am asking the BCA to release as much information, as quickly as they are able to,” Hodges said in a statement. Both officers involved in the shooting were placed on paid administrative leave, the Star Tribune reported. Justine Damond, who had lived in Minneapolis for roughly three years, was a trained yoga teacher and worked as a motivational speaker and life coach, according to her personal website . She grew up in Sydney, and completed a degree in veterinary science at the University of Sydney in 2002 before moving to the U.S., according to her LinkedIn profile . Jo Grabyn, a friend and fellow Australian, told HuffPost on Monday that she was “in shock and totally confused” about the circumstances surrounding her friend’s death. “She was such a shining light in so many ways,” Grabyn, 42, said. “She leaves a gaping hole in so many lives. [She] deserved three lifetimes, not less than half of one.” The Lake Harriet Spiritual Community Center, where Justine Damond gave weekly talks on meditation, said in a statement to HuffPost that she preached and practiced “love and peace and non-violence.” “She inspired us with example of how she chose to live her life,” the center said. “While this is a tragic event, Justine would want us to use this opportunity to develop greater love and compassion for each other, and look to find solutions by thinking differently.” A neighbor reportedly told reporters the victim was critical of lenient American gun laws, compared with those in Australia. Following a shooting rampage that left 35 people dead in 1996, Australia passed anti-gun violence measures that introduced lengthy background checks and required all firearms to be registered to a licensed owner and stored under strict conditions, separate from ammunition. Australia, like countries such as Germany and New Zealand, has encouraged citizens traveling to the U.S. to be aware of high levels of gun violence. The country’s foreign affairs department website warns travelers to “be vigilant about possibility of gun crime in all parts” of the U.S. The Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area was rocked by another police shooting last year, when a St. Anthony officer fatally shot Philando Castile in a St. Paul suburb just miles from the scene of Saturday night’s killing. An officer was charged in the death of Castile, who was black, but was acquitted last month . He has since left the St. Anthony police force. This article has been updated to include additional details about the victim. Ryan Grenoble and Nick Wing contributed reporting.

Streep’s statement comes four days after an explosive report in the New York Times detailed decades of allegations of sexual harassment and abuse. On Sunday, the board of directors of the Weinstein Company terminated him citing “new information about misconduct by Harvey Weinstein that has emerged in the past few days.” Here’s Streep’s full statement: “The disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed, and those whose good and worthy causes he supported. The intrepid women who raised their voices to expose this abuse are our heroes. One thing can be clarified. Not everybody knew. Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally. I didn’t know about these other offenses: I did not know about his financial settlements with actresses and colleagues; I did not know about his having meetings in his hotel room, his bathroom, or other inappropriate, coercive acts. And If everybody knew, I don’t believe that all the investigative reporters in the entertainment and the hard news media would have neglected for decades to write about it. The behavior is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar. Each brave voice that is raised, heard and credited by our watchdog media will ultimately change the game.” Weinstein was initially suspended by his eponymous company following the revelations, which included claims from former staffers as well as actresses like Ashley Judd. And on Friday, TV reporter Lauren Sivan told HuffPost exclusively that Weinstein had cornered her at a restaurant closed to the public and masturbated in front of her. Members of the entertainment community have come under fire for being slow in responding to the Weinstein crisis. Over the weekend, “Saturday Night Live” Executive Producer Lorne Michaels came under fire for cutting jokes from the show that involved Weinstein.  The New York Times reported that several jokes were tested during dress rehearsal but that they “fell flat” with the studio audience. Michaels said he cut the jokes because Weinstein is a “New York thing,” meaning that he didn’t feel a national audience would appreciate the jokes. Most of the late-night hosts, including Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert, omitted the story in their Thursday night broadcasts. On “The Daily Show,” host Trevor Noah on Thursday made only a passing reference to Weinstein. Weinstein was a prominent donor to Democratic candidates and liberal causes and was a frequent guest at the White Houses of former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Some Democrats who received donations from him have pledged to donate the money to other causes. While some Hollywood stars have called out Weinstein, including younger actors like Lena Dunham and Amber Tamblyn, longtime collaborators like Gwyneth Paltrow and Quentin Tarantino have remained silent.

Netflix confirmed in a statement that Andy Yeatman, its director of global kids content, made those “careless” and “uninformed” comments, but noted that he was not initially aware that the woman he was speaking to had accused Masterson of rape. Masterson stars in the Netflix program “The Ranch,” alongside his former “That ’70s Show” co-star Ashton Kutcher (“That ’70s Show” is also streaming on Netflix). Although four women have accused Masterson of raping them and the Los Angeles County District Attorney and Los Angeles Police Department are investigating the allegations, Netflix has not taken any action against the actor, not even a suspension pending investigation. The lack of action on Netflix’s part ― even though the company moved quickly to suspend and then fire Kevin Spacey after BuzzFeed published a report detailing an allegation of sexual misconduct against the actor ― has led to outrage on Twitter, an online petition that had gained over 36,000 signatures by Monday morning, and a Daily Beast story titled “ Netflix’s Disturbing Sexual-Assault Hypocrisy .” Yeatman spoke with the woman, whom HuffPost is referring to as Victim B, on the sidelines of a kids’ soccer game in Los Angeles. Yeatman is the head coach of a soccer team for 8- and 9-year-old girls. Victim B’s husband is the head coach of the team that played against Yeatman’s on Sunday. Their respective daughters play on the teams that their fathers coach. When Victim B approached Yeatman and asked him if he worked at Netflix, she says he answered in the affirmative. Victim B said she asked Yeatman why Netflix was not taking action against Masterson in light of the district attorney’s investigation and the multiple accusations of rape. According to Victim B and another witness, Yeatman said Netflix takes sexual misconduct allegations seriously but that “we don’t believe them,” referring to Masterson’s four accusers. Victim B told HuffPost she never expected Yeatman to say such a thing and was left stunned. She said she then told him, “I’m one of them,” indicating she was one of Masterson’s accusers. The conversation ended quickly. Victim B said Yeatman approached her at the game about an hour later, ostensibly to clear the air, and told her that he’d had no idea she was one of Masterson’s alleged victims. Victim B told HuffPost that she began to cry and told Yeatman, “I hope no one ever says that to your daughter.” Yeatman then told her that he can’t decide whether Netflix takes action against Masterson. Victim B told Yeatman that she and the other women accusing Masterson of rape were telling the truth and that “ Netflix is going to regret this, this is a mistake, they’re going to see.” Victim B said, and the witness confirmed, that Yeatman said, in what they described as a condescending tone, “we’ll see.” A Netflix spokesman denied that Yeatman said “we’ll see.” But the company confirmed in a statement that Yeatman told Victim B that Netflix executives didn’t believe the four women accusing Masterson of rape. “While he was coaching a youth soccer match today, Mr. Yeatman ― a Netflix kids’ programming executive ― was approached by a stranger who did not identify herself or explain her connection to Danny Masterson,” the statement read. “Mr. Yeatman’s comments were careless, uninformed and do not represent the views of the company. Further, he would have no insights into decision making on The Ranch . We are aware of the allegations against Danny Masterson and we are following the current investigation, and will respond if developments occur.” Victim B said she initially approached Yeatman when she found out from her husband that he was a Netflix executive. Frustrated by the silence from Netflix on the Masterson issue, she said she hoped he could provide some direction. She said she didn’t intend to identify herself as an alleged victim until Yeatman said higher-ups at Netflix didn’t believe Masterson’s accusers. Victim B noted that she had seen Yeatman in the past at other soccer games and that her husband knew him from previous games. Lilly Yeatman, the wife of Andy Yeatman, sent an email to the husband of Victim B after this piece was initially published, saying Victim B “has really done a terrible thing to a great guy” and that her husband “is terribly sad and heartbroken for any woman who has been hurt or mistreated.” The email, which Victim B provided to HuffPost, was sent from Lilly Yeatman’s professional email address at Disney. Neither Disney nor Lilly Yeatman immediately responded to a request for comment. Masterson has been the subject of an almost year-long investigation conducted by the LAPD and the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office. Four women have accused Masterson of violently raping them in the early 2000s . They have told law enforcement that they believe Masterson spiked their drinks with something that led them to black out before and during the alleged rapes. Masterson has denied all allegations of rape and said that the encounters in question were consensual. An attorney for the actor denied that Masterson ever placed any drugs in someone else’s drink and said that as a Scientologist, Masterson has a strict anti-drug policy for himself and for guests in his home. Netflix has known about the accusations since at least March, when journalist Tony Ortega revealed that the LAPD had an active investigation into multiple allegations of rape against the actor. Three of the women who have accused Masterson were members of the Church of Scientology at the time they say they were raped. Church doctrine says that contacting law enforcement to report another Scientologist is a high crime and will lead to being declared a suppressive person ― meaning that person will be shunned from the church, and their friends and family members who are church members must stop speaking to them. Despite that edict, Victim B filed a police report against Masterson in 2004. But the case was quickly thwarted when dozens of Scientologists filed affidavits with the LAPD claiming that Victim B wasn’t telling the truth. The LAPD officially reopened the case against Masterson in January, and referred it to the district attorney in April. Sources in the police department and district attorney’s office have described the evidence against Masterson as “compelling” and “overwhelming.” This article has been updated with details from Lilly Yeatman’s email to the husband of Victim B.

monday","One of actor Danny Masterson ’s alleged sexual assault victims says a Netflix executive told her this weekend that higher-ups at the company don’t believe the four women who have accused Masterson of rape.
Netflix confirmed in a statement that Andy Yeatman, its director of global kids content, made those “careless” and “uninformed” comments, but noted that he was not initially aware that the woman he was speaking to had accused Masterson of rape.
Although four women have accused Masterson of raping them and the Los Angeles County District Attorney and Los Angeles Police Department are investigating the allegations, Netflix has not taken any action against the actor, not even a suspension pending investigation.
The lack of action on Netflix’s part ― even though the company moved quickly to suspend and then fire Kevin Spacey after BuzzFeed published a report detailing an allegation of sexual misconduct against the actor ― has led to outrage on Twitter, an online petition that had gained over 36,000 signatures by Monday morning, and a Daily Beast story titled “ Netflix’s Disturbing Sexual-Assault Hypocrisy .” Yeatman spoke with the woman, whom HuffPost is referring to as Victim B, on the sidelines of a kids’ soccer game in Los Angeles.
Victim B said she asked Yeatman why Netflix was not taking action against Masterson in light of the district attorney’s investigation and the multiple accusations of rape.
According to Victim B and another witness, Yeatman said Netflix takes sexual misconduct allegations seriously but that “we don’t believe them,” referring to Masterson’s four accusers.
Victim B told HuffPost that she began to cry and told Yeatman, “I hope no one ever says that to your daughter.” Yeatman then told her that he can’t decide whether Netflix takes action against Masterson.
“While he was coaching a youth soccer match today, Mr. Yeatman ― a Netflix kids’ programming executive ― was approached by a stranger who did not identify herself or explain her connection to Danny Masterson,” the statement read.
We are aware of the allegations against Danny Masterson and we are following the current investigation, and will respond if developments occur.” Victim B said she initially approached Yeatman when she found out from her husband that he was a Netflix executive.
She said she didn’t intend to identify herself as an alleged victim until Yeatman said higher-ups at Netflix didn’t believe Masterson’s accusers.
Netflix has known about the accusations since at least March, when journalist Tony Ortega revealed that the LAPD had an active investigation into multiple allegations of rape against the actor."

But one thing is clear: The bill is filled with perks for America’s wealthiest individuals and largest corporations, many of them paid for by closing loopholes that benefit middle-class people. By 2027, the top one-fifth of earners would receive 90 percent of the tax bill’s benefits, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Here are some of the legislation’s most outrageous components ― from giveaways for the super-rich to carve-outs for private schools. Dramatically reducing the corporate tax rate. The centerpiece of the Republican tax bill is its slashing of the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. Republicans claim this is necessary to restore American competitiveness, noting that, on paper at least, the United States has one of the highest corporate rates in the developed world. However, many large corporations are able to take advantage of deductions and loopholes that allow them to register profits overseas. This means that in practice, the average effective corporate tax rate on profit from new investments in the U.S. is 24 percent ― just a shade higher than the G-7 average of 21 percent. There are, of course, proponents of a lower corporate tax rate in both major political parties. Former President Barack Obama , for example, proposed lowering the top corporate rate to 28 percent as part of a revenue-neutral, comprehensive tax reform package. But without major changes in the way corporations do business, a big corporate tax cut is not actually likely to result in more job creation and higher wages. Instead, it is just a windfall for the corporate executive suite that is bound to exacerbate income inequality. That’s because corporate incentives are such that executives and their boards are rewarded for how much they maximize quarterly returns for big investors , not how much they invest in the long-term growth of their companies ― let alone how they treat their workers. As a result, Fortune 500 CEOs and their fellow decision-makers are just as likely to spend the extra cash they get from this massive tax cut on dividends and stock buybacks, rather than expanding their workforces. They have even said as much . Creating a big new tax deduction for private school tuition. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) succeeded in adding an amendment to the final bill that would expand tax-exempt 529 college savings plans to parents saving for K-12 private school tuition, as well as expenses associated with home schooling. Technically the expanded savings accounts would allow parents to amass tax-free savings for public school education as well, but it is not at all clear what major costs are incurred from a public school education. And there are no exceptions to the types of schooling eligible for the tax break, meaning that the tax code is now almost certain to subsidize private religious education. “By expanding choice for parents and opportunities for children, we have prioritized the education of the next generation of Americans, allowing families to save and prepare for their children’s future educational expenses,” Cruz said in a statement about the amendment’s passage. Although the tax benefit is sure to save some families money, the ballooning cost of private elementary and secondary school makes it unlikely that it will increase access to private school for middle- and low-income kids. Average annual tuition at non-sectarian private elementary schools rose from $4,120 in 1979 to $22,611 in 2011, according to a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research released in July. It’s no surprise then that in 2013, 26 percent of families in urban area with incomes in the 90th income percentile sent their kids to private school, compared to just 7 percent of families in the 50th percentile, according to NBER. In 1968, by contrast, the study said, there was a gap of just 5 percentage points in the two income groups’ respective rates of private school enrollment. Encouraging corporations to automate ― without any help for displaced workers. A provision of the tax bill would allow companies to deduct from their taxable income the entire cost of certain kinds of business investments that were previously only eligible for a 50 percent deduction. Traditionally, manufacturing firms and other infrastructure-heavy companies took advantage of the deduction to buy new factory equipment. But the increase in the deduction comes at a time when corporations are investing in automation of their production facilities through the use of robots and artificial intelligence technology, noted Robert Kovacev, a corporate tax attorney for the Steptoe & Johnson law firm in Washington, D.C. “It’s going to accelerate spending, basically, on robots that could displace workers,” Kovacev told HuffPost. Kovacev is supportive of the deduction, because automation is likely to increase productivity ― defined as the amount of economic output generated per work-hour. And many experts maintain that, over the long run, this type of technological disruption is a net job creator. That is likely to serve as cold comfort, however, for the mostly blue-collar workers displaced by automation in the short term. And Congress chose to speed up the automation process without any companion measures to offset the fallout for affected workers. “It would be a good idea to pair this with a tax incentive to encourage companies either to employ more human workers or retrain them for jobs in the new economy,” Kovacev said. Some progressive lawmakers have other ideas about how to address the harm caused by automation. For example, San Francisco County Supervisor Jane Kim has explored the idea of implementing a ” robot tax ” on companies for every robot they employ to perform a job previously done by humans. The revenue raised by the tax would fund the retraining of displaced workers. Setting the stage for cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. The Republican tax bill will add $1 trillion to the national debt over a 10-year period, according to the most recent estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan congressional tax analysis body. The lack of measures to pay for the tax cuts is why Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) decided to vote against the final Senate bill, becoming the only Republican to do so. Many progressive economists believe the national debt is not a major challenge at this juncture. Interest rates on Treasury bonds remain low by historical standards. Still, once Republicans pass their budget-busting tax cuts, they frequently stoke debt fears to justify taking an ax to federal spending. They did it when Obama took office despite their overwhelming support for former President George W. Bush’s tax cuts, and they have already indicated they plan to do it again. This time, though, they are coming for the three largest social insurance programs ― Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) was one of several Republican lawmakers to explicitly say that following the changes to the tax code, the next priority would be scaling back so-called “entitlement” spending. “You also have to bring spending under control. And not discretionary spending. That isn’t the driver of our debt,” Rubio said last week . “The driver of our debt is the structure of Social Security and Medicare for future beneficiaries.” Rejecting a proposal to expand a tax credit for families with children in order to reduce the corporate tax rate even more. Rubio and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) wanted to add an amendment to the tax bill that would have modestly expanded the Child Tax Credit, which is effectively a cash benefit for low-income working families with children. The latest version of the change would have provided some 10 million families with about $75 more per year , according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. To pay for the roughly $87 billion price of expanding the tax credit, Rubio and Lee proposed reducing the top corporate tax rate to just under 21 percent, rather than the 20 percent threshold that President Donald Trump and GOP leaders were seeking. The amendment collapsed in a 71-29 vote with just 20 Republicans and nine Democrats voting for it. Most Republicans objected to the amendment on the grounds that the corporate rate needed to drop to 20 percent. Democrats declined to rally behind it, because they argued that the tax credit was far too small to provide meaningful help to vulnerable people and that GOP leaders would ultimately strip it out in conference committee regardless. All but eliminating the estate tax for the country’s wealthiest households. Under the Senate bill, an even tinier sliver of households in the country would be subject to the estate tax levied on the assets that ultra-rich individuals leave to their heirs when they die. Currently, $11 million in assets are exempt from the estate tax, ensuring that it falls on just 0.2 percent of American households with taxable assets. While the top statutory estate tax rate is 40 percent, the average effective rate paid by families subject to the tax is about 17 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center . The tax nonetheless serves as a major source of revenue for the federal government and achieves the additional goal of modestly limiting intergenerational wealth transfers, which some experts believe undermine meritocracy and social mobility. The Senate bill would double the estate tax exemption to $22 million for couples, eliminating the tax entirely for half the estates that currently pay it, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities . Those households still subject to the tax would get a $4.4 million tax cut, which CBPP points out would be enough to provide Pell grants to fund college tuition for 1,100 low- and moderate-income students. The bill Republicans passed in the House gets rid of the estate tax entirely over time.",48.84,12,14.1,1648,1648,"tax

Last week, CNN published a report on modern slavery in Libya, featuring a video that reportedly was shot in August and appeared to show a man selling African migrants for farm work. “Big strong boys,” the man said in the video, according to a CNN narrator. “400 … 700 … 800,” he called out the mounting prices. The men were eventually sold for about $400 each, CNN reported. The Libyan government said it has launched an investigation into slave auctions in the country. Following the CNN report, demonstrators took to the streets in Paris and other cities last week to express their outrage, and Libyans showed their solidarity on Twitter with the hashtag #LibyansAgainstSlavery . Several world leaders spoke out as well. The chairman of the African Union, Guinean President Alpha Condé, called it a “despicable trade ... from another era” on Friday. The U.N. Support Mission in Libya said Wednesday that it was “dismayed and sickened,” and is “actively pursuing” the matter with Libyan authorities. “ I am horrified at news reports and video footage showing African migrants in Libya reportedly being sold as slaves,” U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said to reporters on Monday. “Slavery has no place in our world, and these actions are among the most egregious abuses of human rights and may amount to crimes against humanity.” Guterres called for the international community to unite in fighting the abuse and smuggling of migrants, notably by increasing avenues for legal migration and enhancing international cooperation in cracking down on smugglers and traffickers. However, rights advocates caution that real action may be slow in coming. “People are rightfully outraged,” Human Rights Watch researcher Hanan Salah told Reuters of CNN’s video on Monday. “But don’t hold your breath that anything real is going to happen.” There are more than 45 million people worldwide who are victims of modern slavery , including forced labor and human trafficking, according to a September report from the human rights group Walk Free Foundation. In Libya, migrants have become particularly vulnerable to human trafficking. The country functions as the main gateway for Africans to reach Europe , but it is also one of the world’s most unstable , mired in conflict since dictator Muammar Gaddafi was ousted and killed in 2011. Hundreds of thousands of migrants fleeing poverty or conflict travel to Libya each year, hoping to set off from the country’s coast to Europe. Once in Libya, they find themselves at the mercy of smugglers operating the dangerous boat passages across the Mediterranean. Operating without many constraints, smuggling networks have adopted ruthless methods ― often killing, torturing, extorting and detaining migrants at will. The Libyan government does not have the means nor the commitment to crack down. European countries’ efforts to keep migrants from their own borders have forced the travelers to take ever greater risks to reach the continent. “To end the slave trade we need to stop human smuggling,” William Lacy Swing, director general of the International Organization for Migration, said Thursday . “You do that by destroying their business model. And you do that by ... decriminalizing migration and encouraging migration that is documented, safe and secure for all.”",53.1,10.3,11.7,542,542,"said

“Slavery has no place in our world, and these actions are among the most egregious abuses of human rights and may amount to crimes against humanity.” Guterres called for the international community to unite in fighting the abuse and smuggling of migrants, notably by increasing avenues for legal migration and enhancing international cooperation in cracking down on smugglers and traffickers.
“But don’t hold your breath that anything real is going to happen.” There are more than 45 million people worldwide who are victims of modern slavery , including forced labor and human trafficking, according to a September report from the human rights group Walk Free Foundation.
In Libya, migrants have become particularly vulnerable to human trafficking."

Bannon picked apart the problems of the White House and derided the couple as “Javanka” in a wide-ranging interview with Vanity Fair published Thursday. He said Ivanka was a “fount of bad advice during the campaign,” and claimed he once called her to her face “the queen of leaks.” Vanity Fair also reported Bannon considers Kushner an elitist with no political experience who is in over his head and is out of touch with Trump’s constituency. “He doesn’t know anything about the hobbits or the deplorables,” Bannon said. “The railhead of all bad decisions is the same railhead: Javanka.” He said it was Kushner who encouraged Trump to fire FBI director James Comey. “It’s the dumbest political decision in modern political history, bar none,” Bannon insisted, calling it a “self-inflicted wound of massive proportions.” Bannon didn’t exactly gush about his old boss, either. “The Trump presidency that we fought for, and won, is over,” he told writer Gabriel Sherman, and reportedly told a friend last month that he believes the president has “lost a step.” He joked to Vanity Fair that Trump is “like an 11-year-old child.” Bannon has reportedly said in private conversations that he believes Trump only has a 30 percent chance of finishing his term because he may be impeached or removed from office under the 25th Amendment. Bannon doesn’t let himself off easy, either. “I realize in hindsight I was just a staffer, and I’m not a good staffer,” he said. “I had influence, I had a lot of influence, but just influence.” Now, outside of the White House and back at Breitbart, Bannon said, he feels more powerful. “I have power.

Trump spent much of the weekend assuring Americans that he was following the storm, posting self-congratulatory tweets and boasting about the “great talent on the ground.” “So far, so good!” Trump tweeted at Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on Saturday, after the lawmaker warned that the storm presented a critical moment for the president, citing the poor response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 by then-President George W. Bush’s administration. Later on Sunday evening, Trump issued another, similar tweet thanking no one in particular. Although Hurricane Harvey has been downgraded to a tropical storm, heavy rainfall from it is expected to last for days and the Houston area braced for the prospect of catastrophic flooding . The National Weather Service reported at least five fatalities in the region. According to Trump’s weekend schedule, he has been monitoring the storm from his Camp David retreat, receiving regular updates from authorities. But it was clear from his tweets that Trump’s priorities were not entirely on the disaster. On Sunday, Trump announced via Twitter that he would visit Texas “as soon as that trip can be made without causing disruption.” Yet he immediately tweeted that he would also visit Missouri. He bragged that Missouri is “a wonderful state...that I won by a lot” in the 2016 election, and he politicized the visit by predicting that a Republican would defeat its Democratic U.S. senator, Claire McCaskill, who is up for re-election next year. Among Trump’s other missives on Sunday morning: reiterating that Mexico would provide reimbursements for his long-promised border wall and charging that Mexico and Canada are “being very difficult” in negotiations to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement. He also asserted that NAFTA was the “worst trade deal ever made”. He even found time to plug a book by ardent supporter David Clarke, the sheriff of Milwaukee County who runs a jail where the deaths last year of four persons ― including a newborn ― have raised concerns about its operations. On Friday evening, while Hurricane Harvey was about to make landfall, Trump used the opportunity to unleash a storm of other news , spurring questions about whether he deliberately timed the actions to keep the spotlight off them. He quietly issued a memo outlining guidance on enforcing his decision to ban transgender people from serving in the military. He also pardoned Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff who had been found in contempt of court for violating a judge’s order stemming from a racial profiling case. Notwithstanding Hurricane Harvey, Trump’s pardon of Arpaio spurred fierce criticism, including from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). Despite Trump’s emphasis of how well various government entities had responded to Hurricane Harvey, FEMA administrator Brock Long on Sunday warned that recovery efforts had only just begun, characterizing the disaster as “a storm that the United States has not seen yet.” “FEMA is going to be [in Texas] for years,” Long told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “This disaster is going to be a landmark event.”",50.87,11.2,13.5,527,527,"trump

Petty was found unconscious in his home Sunday night and was rushed to the UCLA Medical Center at Santa Monica while in “full cardiac arrest,” according to TMZ. The outlet reported he was taken off life support the next day when he was found to have “no brain activity.” Several news outlets, including HuffPost, had announced the singer’s death earlier Monday after the Los Angeles Police Department “inadvertently provided [info] to some media sources.” The outlets walked those reports back, and the police apologized for the error . Late Monday, the band’s manager released a statement confirming the death of the music icon: Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers released their self-titled debut in 1976, which included the Top 40 hit “Breakdown.” Over the following decades, the band turned out over a dozen studio albums and a steady string of hits that included “Don’t Do Me Like That,” “Refugee,” “The Waiting” and “American Girl.” Petty also kept busy with solo hits such as “Free Fallin’” and “I Won’t Back Down,” as well as performing with the band Mudcrutch and the Traveling Wilburys, a folk-rock supergroup featuring Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne and Roy Orbison. Dylan, reached by Rolling Stone, described Petty’s death as “ shocking, crushing news ” and said he would always remember his friend. “I thought the world of Tom,” he told the outlet. “He was great performer, full of the light, a friend, and I’ll never forget him.” Born in Gainesville, Florida, on Oct. 20, 1950, Petty’s childhood was marred by poverty and hardship. In “ Petty: The Biography ,” written by fellow musician and superfan Warren Zanes, Petty recalled being frequently beaten by his abusive father . “When my father got home ... he came in, took a belt and beat the living shit out of me ,” he said. “He beat me so bad that I was covered in raised welts, from my head to my toes. I mean, you can’t imagine someone hitting a child like that.” Petty said he found solace and meaning through music early on. At the age of 11, he famously met Elvis Presley while the rock and roll star was in Florida filming a movie. In an interview with Esquire, Petty said he remembered Presley looking almost mythical. “I was really young and impressionable,” Petty recalled. “Elvis really did look ... sort of not real, as if he were glowing. He was astounding, even spiritual.” Petty said his meeting with Presley sparked his love for rock and roll, but it was The Beatles’ 1964 appearance on “The Ed Sullivan Show” that convinced him to make his own music. “This was the great moment in my life, really, that changed everything ,” he said. Petty quit high school when he was 17 to join Mudcrutch, a rock group that would include two of his future bandmates, Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench. The pair would join Petty to become longtime members of the Heartbreakers in 1975. The newly formed group released their debut album, “Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,” a year later. The group had a slow beginning, but became a hit a few years later with the album “Damn the Torpedoes,” which sold 3 million copies and was certified multiplatinum. Petty and the Heartbreakers continued to tour for decades, releasing hit record after hit record, including several with Petty billed as a solo artist with backing from several bandmates. The hit song “Free Fallin’” came in 1989 as part of his debut solo album “Full Moon Fever,” which sold 5 million copies and went on to become his best-selling record. Following the end of his first marriage, to Jane Benyo, after more than 20 years, Petty fought and overcame heroin addiction in the late 1990s, spending time in rehab. “Using heroin went against my grain,” he told Zanes, his biographer. “I didn’t want to be enslaved to anything. So I was always trying to figure out how to do less, and then that wouldn’t work. Tried to go cold turkey, and that wouldn’t work. It’s an ugly fucking thing.” Petty went on to produce more hit records and tour the world, including two headlining spots at the Bonnaroo Music Festival ― in both 2006 and 2013. “I like to play these festivals. We’re one of those old, lucky bands ,” Petty told Rolling Stone in 2013. “Young people come to see us. It makes a difference.” He added that the previous few years had been “so wonderful” for the band. “We’re such happy campers – sickeningly happy,” he said. Petty, who sold more than 80 million albums worldwide over the course of his illustrious career, was nominated for 18 Grammy awards and won three, including Best Male Rock Vocal Performance in 1995 for “You Don’t Know How It Feels.” He’s also considered one of the greatest songwriters to have ever lived . In 2002, Petty was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame alongside the rest of the Heartbreakers. “A rock star is the single purest mainstream manifestation of the American dream,” he said at the time, expressing gratitude for the honor. “I marvel at this.” The Heartbreakers have continued to perform with few changes to the band’s original lineup, marking the 40th anniversary of their debut record last year. Their anniversary tour kicked off in April, but in an interview with Rolling Stone , Petty called it the group’s “last big one.” “We’re all on the backside of our sixties,” he said. “I have a granddaughter now I’d like to see as much as I can. I don’t want to spend my life on the road. This tour will take me away for four months. With a little kid, that’s a lot of time.” Petty’s daughter AnnaKim shared a series of Instagram posts late Monday remembering her father’s legacy and her experiences growing up the child of a rock star. Early Tuesday, she posted an image of Petty with the words “RIP.” She also shared the lyrics to Petty’s song “Alright for Now,” which begins: “Goodnight baby, sleep tight my love. May God watch over you from above.” Petty is survived by his second wife, Dana York, whom he married in 2001, his daughters Adria and AnnaKim, and a stepson, Dylan. Mourning Petty’s death, some fans have been sharing a particularly poignant song on social media: The 1989 Traveling Wilburys’ song “End of the Line,” which was released after the death of band member Roy Orbison. “Maybe somewhere down the road a ways, you’ll think of me,” Petty croons in the song. “And wonder where I am these days.” This story has been updated to include confirmation Petty died, as well as to account for earlier mistaken reports of his death.

Petty and the Heartbreakers continued to tour for decades, releasing hit record after hit record, including several with Petty billed as a solo artist with backing from several bandmates.
The hit song “Free Fallin’” came in 1989 as part of his debut solo album “Full Moon Fever,” which sold 5 million copies and went on to become his best-selling record.
It’s an ugly fucking thing.” Petty went on to produce more hit records and tour the world, including two headlining spots at the Bonnaroo Music Festival ― in both 2006 and 2013.
Petty, who sold more than 80 million albums worldwide over the course of his illustrious career, was nominated for 18 Grammy awards and won three, including Best Male Rock Vocal Performance in 1995 for “You Don’t Know How It Feels.” He’s also considered one of the greatest songwriters to have ever lived .
In 2002, Petty was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame alongside the rest of the Heartbreakers.
“I marvel at this.” The Heartbreakers have continued to perform with few changes to the band’s original lineup, marking the 40th anniversary of their debut record last year.
Their anniversary tour kicked off in April, but in an interview with Rolling Stone , Petty called it the group’s “last big one.” “We’re all on the backside of our sixties,” he said.
With a little kid, that’s a lot of time.” Petty’s daughter AnnaKim shared a series of Instagram posts late Monday remembering her father’s legacy and her experiences growing up the child of a rock star.
“And wonder where I am these days.” This story has been updated to include confirmation Petty died, as well as to account for earlier mistaken reports of his death."

Irma had weakened slightly on Saturday as it moved past northern Cuba, but regained strength overnight as it headed northwest toward the Tampa area, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without power. The storm was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane at 2 a.m. ET on Sunday. Irma has killed at least 22 people and displaced thousands so far. The storm’s unexpected turn caught residents of Tampa and surrounding areas off guard, The Associated Press reported , noting that Tampa hasn’t weathered a major hurricane since 1921. Irma was downgraded to a Category 3 hurricane on Saturday after pummeling much of the Antilles islands as a Category 5 over the last week. The National Hurricane Center expected the storm’s maximum winds to increase again once it moves away from Cuba and towards Florida. Gov. Rick Scott (R) stressed that people in evacuation zones absolutely had to leave. Roughly 6.3 million people have been told to evacuate, according to the Florida Division of Emergency Management. “This will cover your house,” Scott said, referring to the 12-foot storm surge expected in some areas . “You will not survive all this storm surge. This is a life-threatening situation.” ***Scroll down for the latest updates*** Irma is forecast to make landfall in the Florida Keys on Sunday morning before approaching Naples on the state’s southwest coast, fluctuating in intensity while remaining extremely dangerous. Up to 25 inches of rain may fall in some parts of the Keys. The National Weather Service strongly urged anyone remaining in the Keys to evacuate immediately, warning in a tweet that Irma is “as real as it gets.” Although the center of the hurricane is now expected to miss Miami, meteorologists say they believe the city will still see life-threatening winds. Wind gusts in Miramar, which is about 25 miles northwest of Miami, had reached about 35 mph to 40 mph by midday, according to weather reports. There were periods of scattered thunderstorms throughout the day, with rains picking up and a tornado watch going into effect in the evening. Tropical storm effects, including high winds, prompted a curfew in Broward County at 4 p.m. County officials are expecting a storm surge of between 2 feet and 4 feet, and 12 inches to 24 inches of rain over the next 24 hours. Areas in southwestern Florida are also at risk of severe coastal flooding due to a predicted storm surge, which in some places could be more than 15 feet above ground, Scott said Saturday afternoon. Irma set a new record Thursday with wind speeds of at least 185 mph for a period of 37 hours ― the longest any storm on record has maintained such high velocity. The storm’s maximum sustained winds have decreased to 125 mph, but are expected to strengthen to 160 mph over the Keys on Sunday. Meanwhile, Hurricane Katia made landfall on Mexico’s Gulf coast as a Category 1 storm late Friday night and was later downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved through Mexico. Hurricane Jose was also upgraded to a Category 4 storm , and but began to move away from a string of Caribbean islands through the evening. Still, St. Martin and St. Bart remained under tropical storm warnings as of Saturday evening thanks to Jose, CNN reports.

Those events appear in a video filmed two weeks ago by a volunteer with the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia and published by the civil rights group on Saturday. As seen in the footage below, a man in a blue sleeveless shirt, a green vest and a bandana on his head pulls out a gun and aims it at a counterprotester, who is off camera and appears to be holding a makeshift lit torch. The first man appears to yell a racial slur at the black man, then fires the gun toward the ground in the direction of the counterprotesters. The shooter then leaves the scene by joining a line of white supremacist protesters and walking past law enforcement officers, who were standing behind metal barricades about 10 feet away . Police arrested Richard Wilson Preston, 52, in connection with the incident in the video above, the Daily Progress reported on Saturday. Wilson was charged with discharging a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school during the so-called “Unite The Right” rally on Aug. 12. He is in custody in Towson, Maryland. Rosia Parker, a Charlottesville activist who was there when the man fired his gun, told the New York Times that police did nothing when the shooting occurred. “We all heard it and ran ― I know damn well they heard it,” Parker told the Times, referencing the police who were standing behind the barricades. “They never moved.” Corinne Geller, a spokeswoman for the Virginia State Police, told the newspaper that troopers did not react to the shooting because they couldn’t hear the gun being fired over “the loud volume of the crowd yelling and chanting, drums and music.” “Had any one of our troopers witnessed that incident they would have immediately acted just as they did for the other four arrests made during the weekend,” Geller told the Times. In the aftermath of the violence in Charlottesville, the ACLU of Virginia has called on Charlottesville police to release body camera footage from the rally showing any civil rights violations similar to the one in the video. According to the ACLU’s official statement, the video of the shooting is “consistent with our regular calls” for law enforcement agencies to release footage from the protests “that depicts any incident of public concern.” The video was discovered while ACLU staffers were reviewing footage that staff and volunteers documented at the Charlottesville rally. The group turned in the video to the FBI on Aug. 17 and sent copies to the Virginia State Police and Charlottesville Police Department on Aug. 20. A person familiar with the video told HuffPost the ACLU refrained from making the video public until an arrest was made. The Charlottesville Police Department and the Charlottesville communications director did not return HuffPost’s request for comment. Only eight people were arrested on the day that violence broke out between white supremacists, fringe groups and anti-racism protesters in Charlottesville, according to the Times. Among those arrested was James Fields , a 20-year-old white supremacist who killed 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injured dozens of others when he rammed his car into a group of counterprotesters. Two other arrests were made in connection with another violent crime caught on video that took place during the rally. Police arrested Daniel Patrick Borden, 18, and Alex Michael Ramos, 33, in connection with the beating of Deandre Harris , a black 20-year-old who was protesting the white supremacy rally. A mob of white supremacists beat Harris with metal poles in a parking lot near police headquarters during the rally, leaving Harris bloodied, with a broken wrist, deep gashes to the head and a chipped tooth. The assault on Harris was filmed and shared widely on social media.",62.82,10.8,12.7,656,656,"police

Green wrote that Bannon’s comment on Ryan came during the spring of 2016, when it became increasingly possible that Trump would become the GOP presidential nominee, to the surprise and concern of establishment Republicans. Some of them had floated Ryan as a possible alternative if the party’s convention were to become contested. “One fleetingly popular scenario to stop Trump from becoming the nominee was for GOP delegates to coalesce around a white-knight alternative at the party convention in July,” Green wrote, noting that Ryan had “emerged as the chattering-class favorite.” This development, according to Green, “sent Bannon into a panic of his own” and the Breitbart chairman who later that summer would lead Trump’s campaign, began “plotting an all-out war to stop Ryan, of whom he was both fearful and dismissive — sometimes within the same sentence.” While heading Breitbart, the conservative news site that frequently espouses white nationalist views, Bannon had long considered establishment Republicans enemies. One of the site’s reporters, Julia Hahn — now a White House staffer — often wrote pieces critical of Ryan. Ryan’s office did not return a request for comment.

The image has since been deleted, but not before it could be shared and criticized by people online: Many critics questioned just why Trump’s daughter, who is an official but unpaid adviser to her father, should represent the U.S. on such an important world stage ― albeit for a short period of time.

The BBC points out “high-ranking officials” usually cover for leaders when they are absent. It’s not clear exactly why Trump left the meeting, nor how long he was away. The original tweet suggested it was so he could attend “bilateral talks.” A BBC correspondent noted that Ivanka Trump “ did not seem to make any major contribution to the session” during the time she was filling in. Donald Trump had earlier used a World Bank session on women’s entrepreneurship to sing his daughter’s praises. Watch the video here: “I’m very proud of my daughter, Ivanka, always have been, from day one, I had to tell you that, from day one,” he said. “She’s always been great. A champion.

The costumed kids were invited to the Oval Office before trick-or-treating in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. Trump, ever eager to criticize the press , seized the opportunity to make fun of their parents. “I cannot believe the media produced such beautiful children,” Trump said, according to a pool report of the event. “How the media did this, I don’t know.” More from the pool report: Trump pointed at the pool and asked the kids, “Do you know who they are? They are the friendly media.” He comforted one young girl, who was clearly a little nervous and crying. And he maintained a playful banter with the kids and the media. “These are beautiful, wonderful children,” he said, turning to the kids. “Are you going to grow up and be like your parents? Mmm, don’t answer that. It can only get me in trouble. You have wonderful parents, right?” .... “You get treated better by the press than anybody in the world, right?” he said, again eliciting laughter. “Well, congratulations, folks. You did a good job,” he said to the reporters. Trump motioned toward the kids. “Here, you did,” he said. Trump then pointed at himself. “I wouldn’t say you did very well here,” he said. “But really beautiful children.” Trump also handed out candy to the children, and commended them for not having “weight problems.” “Who likes this?” he asked. “Well, you have no weight problems.

The scrapped provision would have required employers to report aggregate information on how much they pay workers ― broken down by gender, race and ethnicity ― and would have been a critical first step in figuring out the scope of the pay gap at different companies. Instead, the Office of Management and Budget said in a memo this week that it was halting implementation so it could review the provision, citing concerns about paperwork and privacy. Ivanka Trump , who speaks frequently about the importance of equal pay for women and who promised last summer that her father feels similarly, issued a statement supporting the move. “Ultimately, while I believe the intention was good and agree that pay transparency is important, the proposed policy would not yield the intended results,” Trump said on Tuesday. “We look forward to continuing to work with [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission], [the Office of Management and Budget], Congress and all relevant stakeholders on robust policies aimed at eliminating the gender wage gap.” She offered no further explanation for the administration’s action or her endorsement of it. Women’s groups universally decried the move. “This is not a technical tweak as they would have you believe. Make no mistake— it’s an all-out attack on equal pay,” Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women’s Law Center, said in a statement on Tuesday. “Today’s action sends a clear message to employers,” Graves added. “If you want to ignore pay inequities and sweep them under the rug, this Administration has your back.” They also took aim at the president’s eldest daughter for betraying her purported commitment to working women. “For somebody who has long held herself out as a champion for women and for gender equality, it’s really disappointing,” Vicki Shabo, vice president for workplace policy and strategy at the National Partnership for Women and Families, told HuffPost on Wednesday. “[This] spits in the eye of gender equality and in the eyes of women and people of color who are so often paid less and do not know.” On average, women in the U.S. are paid 80 cents for every dollar men earn, according to federal data. The pay gap for women of color is even worse. Hispanic women earn 54 cents on the dollar, while black women make 63 cents. Even when researchers analyze the data and account for differences in education and time spent in the labor force, the wage gap persists. Interestingly, Ivanka Trump’s book, a bland treatise called Women Who Work , mentions the term “equal pay” only once, focusing more on individual moves women can make to achieve success in the workplace. “When you’re passionate and work hard you can achieve great things,” she writes. But even when a woman is going full-steam ahead at work, she may not realize that her male peers are out-earning her. After 19 years as a manager at a Goodyear plant in Alabama, Lilly Ledbetter famously found out she had been making less than her male colleagues after someone sent her an anonymous note. Her lawsuit led to the passage of equal pay legislation in 2009. Employers are now required to report information about the race, ethnicity and gender of their employees. Starting a few years ago, tech companies have made their Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reports public, which has led to a painful ― but fruitful ― discussion about the lack of women in the tech industry. It’s easy to imagine how pay data would’ve advanced the conversation even further and made it easier for federal regulators to spot patterns of discrimination. “Having pay data in summary form will help us identify patterns that may warrant further investigation,” the former chairwoman of the EEOC said last year at a conference in New York. In the past, she said, “we’d learn about a pay-discrimination problem because someone saw a piece of paper left on a copy machine or someone was complaining about their salary to co-workers.” Companies with more than 100 workers were set to receive a new form to report the data in September and start providing more detailed information to the EEOC in 2018. Most employers were already preparing to file this data, according to Shabo. Indeed, in recent years, activist shareholders have been pressuring public companies to report data ― a few companies, including Apple and Amazon, have started opening up about gender and pay. Stopping the Obama administration provision from going into effect was the result of an orchestrated effort by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the federal contractors business lobby and anti-worker and anti-regulatory senators on the Hill, Shabo said. It’s even more disappointing because the provision already represented a compromised effort, she added. “It wasn’t as comprehensive or as detailed as we would’ve liked. This was something that was put together with the ease and efficiency of the employer community in mind.” Still, there had been rumors since January that this would happen, and it’s hard to be surprised that the White House, which has been openly hostile to women’s rights ― by rolling back provisions on contraception and reinstating harsh restrictions on women’s health around the world ― would make such a move. “This is not a woman- or family-friendly administration,” Shabo said.",48.64,12.1,13.9,899,899,"equal pay

Kory Langhofer, counsel to the transition team known as Trump for America, Inc., wrote a letter to congressional committees to say Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team had improperly received the emails from the General Services Administration, a government agency. Career staff members at the agency “unlawfully produced TFA’s private materials, including privileged communications, to the Special Counsel’s Office,” according to the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. It said the materials included “tens of thousands of emails.” Trump’s transition team used facilities of the GSA, which helps manage the U.S. government bureaucracy, in the period between the Republican’s November presidential election victory and his inauguration in January. The Trump team’s accusation adds to the growing friction between the president’s supporters and Mueller’s office as it investigates whether Russia interfered in the election and if Trump or anyone on his team colluded with Moscow. Asked for comment, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said: “We continue to cooperate fully with the special counsel and expect this process to wrap up soon.” The GSA and officials at the special counsel’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Norm Eisen, who served on former President Barack Obama’s transition team, responded on Twitter to the letter, saying “there is NO expectation of privacy in your transition emails.” Democrats say there is a wide-ranging effort by the president’s allies on Capitol Hill and in some media outlets to discredit Mueller’s investigation. Trump himself has loudly declared Mueller’s effort a waste of time. “There is absolutely no collusion. That has been proven,” Trump told reporters on Friday. Russia denies interfering in the election. On Friday, Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said he fears the committee’s Republican majority intends to close its investigation of the topic prematurely. Some Republicans have argued that Mueller is biased against Trump and should be fired. The letter was sent to the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, and the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. It asked for Congress to act immediately “to protect future presidential transitions from having their private records misappropriated by government agencies, particularly in the context of sensitive investigations intersecting with political motives.” The letter said Mueller’s office obtained the emails despite the fact that it was aware the GSA did not own or control the records. It said the special counsel’s office has “extensively used the materials in question, including portions that are susceptible to claims of privilege” without notifying the Trump for America team. On the transition team were a number of aides who were later caught up in Mueller’s investigation, such as former national security adviser Michael Flynn who pleaded guilty this month to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia. Langhofer, the Trump transition team lawyer, wrote in his letter that the GSA’s transfer of materials was discovered on Dec. 12 and 13. The FBI had requested the materials from GSA staff last Aug. 23, asking for copies of the emails, laptops, cell phones and other materials associated with nine members of the Trump transition team response for national security and policy matters, the letter said. On Aug. 30, the FBI requested the materials of four additional senior members of the Trump transition team, it said. Langhofer argued that while such transition teams are involved in executive functions, they are considered private, nonprofit organizations whose records are private and not subject to presidential records laws.

The storm and ensuing flooding have left at least 300,000 people without power and roughly 30,000 displaced to temporary shelters . Thousands of people were still awaiting rescue as of Monday night. Dozens of Houston-area churches, schools and community centers opened their doors to offer temporary shelter to survivors, while other local houses of worship organized volunteer teams to help with relief efforts. One church, however, drew criticism online for remaining shut. Joel Osteen’s Lakewood Church, a 16,800-seat indoor arena, announced on Facebook that it was “inaccessible due to severe flooding.” The post included a long list of resources for those affected by the storm, including the street addresses for nine temporary shelters in Houston and surrounding counties. Osteen also posted prayers on social media over the weekend for those affected by the disaster. Osteen and his wife live in a $10.5 million mansion in the upscale River Oaks neighborhood in central Houston. The neighborhood was hit with intense flooding over the weekend, with rescue teams coming to evacuate residents and their dogs . The preacher did not say whether his home was damaged. Lakewood Church has previously helped with relief efforts in the city, most recently hosting a benefit concert in 2016 after heavy flooding. In 2001, the church sheltered roughly 5,000 Texans displaced by a tropical storm. But the church’s response to Harvey drew harsh criticism on social media, with hundreds of users saying Osteen owes the city more than his prayers. Osteen and Lakewood Church did not immediately respond to requests for comment or say what other relief efforts they would be offering. The church announced Monday afternoon that it was partnering with Samaritan’s Purse, a Christian aid organization, to raise funds to support hurricane relief efforts. Freelance reporter Ruth Graham also posted a thread on Twitter saying she had spoken to a Lakewood representative who said the church wouldn’t turn anyone away. The representative also reportedly told Graham that the church wasn’t flooded but would be difficult for most people to access due to nearby flooding. Olsteen and Lakewood Church released another statement Monday night, arguing the establishment did not close its doors and would house people once shelters became full. A photo posted on social media by HuffPost blogger Charles Clymer appeared to show air mattresses being set up in a hallway of the church on Monday night. Don Iloff, a spokesperson for Lakewood, told Chron.com that the church had “begun preparing” for the arrival of evacuees . He was not able to confirm the authenticity of Clymer’s photo which was shared thousands of times on Twitter.

thousands","Dozens of Houston-area churches, schools and community centers opened their doors to offer temporary shelter to survivors, while other local houses of worship organized volunteer teams to help with relief efforts.
Joel Osteen’s Lakewood Church, a 16,800-seat indoor arena, announced on Facebook that it was “inaccessible due to severe flooding.” The post included a long list of resources for those affected by the storm, including the street addresses for nine temporary shelters in Houston and surrounding counties.
Lakewood Church has previously helped with relief efforts in the city, most recently hosting a benefit concert in 2016 after heavy flooding.
Osteen and Lakewood Church did not immediately respond to requests for comment or say what other relief efforts they would be offering.
Freelance reporter Ruth Graham also posted a thread on Twitter saying she had spoken to a Lakewood representative who said the church wouldn’t turn anyone away.
Olsteen and Lakewood Church released another statement Monday night, arguing the establishment did not close its doors and would house people once shelters became full."

Irma weakened to a Category 4 hurricane early Friday after “ pummeling ” the Turks and Caicos islands overnight, but remained a “life-threatening situation,” the National Hurricane Center said . The powerful storm has killed at least 19 people and left thousands displaced. It is expected to make landfall in southern Florida on Sunday, though the region will begin to feel hurricane conditions on Saturday, according to the NHC. Meanwhile, two other storms ― Jose and Katia ― were upgraded to hurricane status on Wednesday afternoon, marking the first time since 2010 that three hurricanes were simultaneously spinning in the Atlantic basin. Residents of the Caribbean islands where Irma has already wrought destruction are just beginning to pick up the pieces and assess the death toll as Jose, which was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane Friday morning, approaches the easternmost islands of the Lesser Antilles.

Lee , Sanders, reading from notes, contended that “all of our leaders have flaws.” “Washington, Jefferson, JFK, Roosevelt, Kennedy. That doesn’t diminish their contributions to our country. It certainly can’t erase them from our history. And Gen. Kelly was simply making the point that just because history isn’t perfect doesn’t mean it’s not our history,” she said.

Equifax, one of the main credit score providers in America, announced Thursday that the company was the victim of a large-scale hack that exposed the personal information, including Social Security numbers, of an estimated 143 million Americans. Hackers gained access to names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and some driver’s license numbers. About 209,000 customers’ credit card numbers were also exposed, as well as dispute documents containing personal information for about 182,000 customers. With a hack that could affect up to 44 percent of the American population, people are understandably anxious to find out if they are among the many whose information is now at risk of identity fraud or being sold on the black market, an underground online marketplace where criminals sell personal information that can be used to get credit cards, take out loans or make purchases. “When this type of stuff happens, it’s like, ‘Oh, crap,’” Alex McGeorge, head of threat intelligence at the security firm Immunity, told Wired . “Your Social Security number doesn’t change, so this data is going to get resold on the black market and hold its value for a while.” To find out if you’ve been affected, you can check on a website Equifax has set up in response to the hack: www.equifaxsecurity2017.com . At the bottom of the page, the company directs you to a link titled “ Potential Impact ,” which allows you to see if your information is safe. In order to do so, you have to provide your last name and the last six digits of your Social Security number. Once you do that, victims of the breach will be scheduled for enrollment in the company’s “complementary” credit-monitoring service, TrustedID Premier , for one year. After the year is up, users may have to pay for the service if they don’t proactively cancel. The terms of use say customers must have internet access and a credit or debit card to sign up. The terms of use for TrustedId says that customers using its products are subject to mandatory, binding arbitration . However, on Friday, Equifax clarified on its website that the “arbitration clause and class action waiver included in the Equifax and TrustedID Premier terms of use does not apply to this cybersecurity incident.” When several HuffPost staff members attempted to check their status, they received one of two messages: One confirms that the user was not affected by the breach and the other message says you may have been affected. Both provide a link to enroll in the company’s credit-monitoring service, TrustedID Premier . In the meantime, you can protect yourself by doing the following: 1. Freeze your credit. Enabling a credit freeze restricts who can see your credit report, preventing lenders and others who you aren’t already familiar with from accessing your information. To do this, call each of the three major credit monitoring bureaus: Experian (888‑397‑3742), TransUnion (888-909-8872) and Equifax (800-349-9960). 2. Activate a free 90-day fraud alert. According to the Federal Trade Commission, you are allowed to activate a free 90-day fraud alert with one of the three credit bureaus, which will make it harder for identity thieves to steal your information. You can also renew it after the 90-day period is over. 3. Check your credit report. Although Equifax announced the security breach on Thursday, it discovered the actual breach on July 29. That means that hackers may have had personal information for a few months before they were caught. Check your credit report using a verified credit report company to see if there have been any accounts opened under your name without your permission. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story listed an incorrect contact number for Equifax. Language has also been changed to note that all three credit score companies, not just one, must be contacted to initiate a credit freeze.

The “mother!” star was among a handful of actresses honored at Elle‘s Women in Hollywood event Monday night, where she took the stage to make a plea to end sexual harassment in the film industry following the mounting allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein . While Lawrence has stated that she never personally witnessed his abuse , the type of behavior described by the many women accusing him unfortunately runs rampant in Hollywood. “When I was much younger and starting out, I was told by the producers of a film to lose 15 pounds in two weeks,” she recalled. “One girl before me had already been fired for not losing enough weight fast enough, and during this time a female producer had me do a nude lineup with about five women who were much, much thinner than me. And we all stood side-by-side with only paste-ons covering our privates.” “After that degrading and humiliating lineup, the female producer told me I should use the naked photos of myself as inspiration for my diet,” she continued, finding the humor in the ridiculous situation. “I can laugh now, it’s OK,” she said. When Lawrence tried to advocate for herself, sharing her experience with both the producer and director of the project, she was given no support. “He asked me to star in a porno as the character, among many other things that are too inappropriate to repeat here in this dress,” she said of the director’s reaction, according to USA Today . As for the producer’s response? “He said he didn’t know why everyone thought I was so fat, he thought I was ‘perfectly f**kable.’” At the time, Lawrence admits she was “trapped” given how desperately she wanted a career as a film actress, choosing to remain silent instead of sharing the harassment with the media. The floodgates, however, have since been opened in the wake of Weinstein’s scandal, as women across the film industry are telling their own stories of abuse, something Lawrence describes as “oddly unifying.” Dozens of women, including actresses Ashley Judd, Mira Sorvino and Gwyneth Paltrow, have accused the producer of sexual misconduct , prompting his firing from The Weinstein Company and expulsion from the Academy earlier this month. While Weinstein denies that any of sexual encounters weren’t consensual, damning investigative reports by The New York Times and The New Yorker detailing decades of abuse paint a different picture. “It’s so fundamental to the female experience to be mistreated and feel ashamed of it,” she said. “In a dream world, everyone is treated with the same amount of respect. But until we reach that goal, I will lend my ear, I will lend my voice to any boy, girl, man or woman who does not feel like they can protect themselves.” “I stand here today to bring the message home and into the hearts of everyone who has felt threatened in this industry,” she concluded. “We will stop normalizing these horrific situations.”",55.07,11.7,13.7,515,515,"lawrence

The ages of the wounded and dead range from 18 months to 77 years. Officials identified the suspect as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley. He is now deceased. Kelley was previously a member of the United States Air Force, serving at a base in New Mexico. He was court-martialed for assault on his wife and child. SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas ― More than 100 people gathered outside the post office here on Sunday night, just blocks away from the First Baptist Church where a lone gunman killed 26 members of this tight-knit community on Sunday morning. It was the worst mass killing in the state’s history. “Who are we going to be tomorrow?” Stephen Curry, a pastor from a nearby church, asked the crowd. “We’re going to be people of love.” “Amen!” the audience exclaimed. Mourners held candles and raised their open palms in the air as religious leaders urged them to help their neighbors heal. Reminders of the tragedy were all around them. Behind the vigil, the lights of a police car continued to flash, and the road toward the church remained blocked off. Officials responded to reports of a gunman at the church at around 11:20 a.m. A young white male wearing black clothing and tactical gear ― whom police later identified as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley ― had opened fire with a Ruger assault-type rifle outside the church and then entered the building, walking to the front of the congregation, as he continued to fire. He kept firing as he walked out of the church’s back door. “I don’t think they could have escaped . You’ve got your pews on either side,” Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt Jr. said Sunday. At that point, a resident began firing with his own weapon, causing the suspect to flee in his car, officials said. The suspect was later found with a fatal gunshot wound in his vehicle in nearby Guadalupe County. Tackitt Jr. told CBS News that authorities were “pretty sure” the wound was self-inflicted. Multiple weapons were found inside the vehicle. Kelley had family members who were congregants of the church, Tackitt said on Monday, but they were not present during the shooting. “We know that his ex-in-law, or in-laws, came to church here from time to time,” Tackitt said. “They were not here yesterday.” However, Lula White, the grandmother of Kelley’s wife, was among those killed in Sunday’s massacre, multiple friends confirmed to CNN on Monday. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said Monday he believes Kelley deliberately targeted the church. “This was not a random active shooting,” he told CBS News. “I don’t think this church was picked out at random. I think there was purpose and intent that Devin Kelley had in showing up at this location.” During a press conference on Sunday afternoon, Abbott confirmed that 26 people had been killed in the shooting. A pregnant woman and several children ― including the church pastor’s 14-year-old daughter ― were among the dead. At least 20 other people were injured. The ages of the wounded and dead ranged from 18 months to 77 years. A witness told San Antonio TV station KENS 5 that the fatalities accounted for about half of the church’s congregation. The massacre took place exactly eight years after an Army psychiatrist killed 13 people on a U.S. military base in Fort Hood, Texas ― just a few hours by car from Sutherland Springs. On Sunday night, shocked community members were still reeling from the massacre that took place just hours before. They described the unincorporated community, home to cattle ranches and oil fields, as the type of place where everyone knows each other. People move there to avoid crime, residents told HuffPost. “It’s a nice, quiet town. It’s respectful,” said former resident Pamela Padilla. “We don’t normally have any crime or anything ... It was a small town, and quiet until today.” “This has just been so devastating. It hasn’t hit home quite yet,” said resident Kelly Carter. “It’s very small, quiet. Everyone knows each other,” said David Betancourt, 18. His friend was wounded in the shooting. The last Betancourt heard, he was undergoing surgery. Michael Ward had family members at the church that morning. When he heard that the killer had fled, he said he considered going after him. But when he saw the police en route, he went to the church with his wife Leslee to look for their relatives. The family of Ward’s brother Chris was severely affected, Ward said. Chris’ wife Joann was in surgery, along with their son Rylan and daughter Brooke. Chris’ daughter Emily was among the deceased, Ward said. Ward later told the Dallas Morning News that Joann and Brooke had also died. Kelley was previously a United States Air Force member who served in logistics readiness at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, from 2010 until his bad conduct discharge in 2014. He was court-martialed in 2012 for assault on his spouse and assault on their child. Academy Sports + Outdoors, a sporting goods store, confirmed that Kelley had purchased two firearms from two San Antonio locations, one in 2016 and one in 2017. They said that both sales were approved by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. “Current law should have prevented him from being able to get a gun; I can tell you that before he made this purchase, he tried to get a gun permit in the state of Texas and was denied that permit,” Abbott said. Sunday’s shooting comes just over a month after a gunman killed 58 people at a country music festival in Las Vegas before killing himself. It was the deadliest mass shooting in recent U.S. history. During a press conference in Tokyo, President Donald Trump said he viewed the deadly shooting as “a mental health problem at the highest level” and not as a “guns situation.” He added that it was “a little bit soon” to get into a discussion about gun control. The president, who is currently on a five-nation tour through Asia, had earlier tweeted his prayers to the people of Sutherland Springs and gave an official statement on the shooting. He called the attack an “act of evil,” and later ordered for U.S. flags to be flown at half-staff to honor those killed. Mike Gonzalez, who lives nearby and works at Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, helped lead prayers at Sunday night’s vigil. “Let us not be people of anger,” he told the crowd. “Let us not be people of fear. Let us build your kingdom as something constructive in the face of destruction.” “I propose that we make a pact, right here, in this small town, that evil will not prevail!” This story has been updated with new information about the victims and the suspect.

help","At least 26 are dead and 20 others injured after a gunman opened fire at a small Baptist church in rural Texas on Sunday morning.
Kelley was previously a member of the United States Air Force, serving at a base in New Mexico.
SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas ― More than 100 people gathered outside the post office here on Sunday night, just blocks away from the First Baptist Church where a lone gunman killed 26 members of this tight-knit community on Sunday morning.
Officials responded to reports of a gunman at the church at around 11:20 a.m. A young white male wearing black clothing and tactical gear ― whom police later identified as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley ― had opened fire with a Ruger assault-type rifle outside the church and then entered the building, walking to the front of the congregation, as he continued to fire.
At that point, a resident began firing with his own weapon, causing the suspect to flee in his car, officials said.
Tackitt Jr. told CBS News that authorities were “pretty sure” the wound was self-inflicted.
Kelley had family members who were congregants of the church, Tackitt said on Monday, but they were not present during the shooting.
“We know that his ex-in-law, or in-laws, came to church here from time to time,” Tackitt said.
“They were not here yesterday.” However, Lula White, the grandmother of Kelley’s wife, was among those killed in Sunday’s massacre, multiple friends confirmed to CNN on Monday.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said Monday he believes Kelley deliberately targeted the church.
“This was not a random active shooting,” he told CBS News.
I think there was purpose and intent that Devin Kelley had in showing up at this location.” During a press conference on Sunday afternoon, Abbott confirmed that 26 people had been killed in the shooting.
A pregnant woman and several children ― including the church pastor’s 14-year-old daughter ― were among the dead.
The massacre took place exactly eight years after an Army psychiatrist killed 13 people on a U.S. military base in Fort Hood, Texas ― just a few hours by car from Sutherland Springs.
On Sunday night, shocked community members were still reeling from the massacre that took place just hours before.
People move there to avoid crime, residents told HuffPost.
Michael Ward had family members at the church that morning.
Chris’ daughter Emily was among the deceased, Ward said.
Ward later told the Dallas Morning News that Joann and Brooke had also died.
The president, who is currently on a five-nation tour through Asia, had earlier tweeted his prayers to the people of Sutherland Springs and gave an official statement on the shooting."

Alexandra Brodsky , a civil rights attorney and co-founder of anti-sexual violence organization KnowYourIX , noticed Wednesday morning that the “Rape And Sexual Assault: Renewed Call To Action” report had been taken down. The report can still be accessed on the Obama administration’s archived website . “I went looking for it because I’m working on briefing for a client who’s a survivor and was looking for some literature about the impact of sexual violence and that’s been a really helpful resource for that kind of research,” Brodsky told HuffPost. “But it was no longer on the White House website. It’s not anywhere on the White House website.” While it is commonplace for the White House website to be cleared of its digital content during transitions between presidential administrations, it is unclear whether this report was taken down during the administration turnover on Inauguration Day, which was Jan. 20, or in the months since then. The report, which can also be found on KnowYourIX’s website , was created under the Obama administration by the 2014 White House Council on Women and Girls in partnership with then-Vice President Joe Biden. The findings of the report consist mainly of nonpartisan facts about sexual violence including sexual assault statistics and different ways the criminal justice system and college campuses can improve in combatting sexual and gender violence. Brodsky tweeted her discovery early Wednesday morning. While the White House declined to clarify exactly when the report was taken down since President Donald Trump took office, a White House spokesperson provided the following statement to HuffPost: At the conclusion of a Presidential Administration, web content from that Administration is archived by NARA and typically made available on an archived website. The policy, process, and extent of archiving of Obama Administration content was determined by the Obama Administration, in consultation with NARA and other stakeholders. Brodsky likened the removal of the report to when the climate change page disappeared from the White House website a few days after Trump was elected. In the days following Trump’s inauguration, many people noticed that certain pages had been removed from the White House website including the LGBT and climate change pages. According to Snopes , it is “inaccurate to say that these terms were specifically scrubbed from the site by Donald Trump.” While the climate change page has since been replaced with a page titled “An America First Energy Plan,” there has been no replacement for the LGBT page. “I think one of the reasons that that example comes to mind is because this is a report of facts and research,” Brodsky said. “This is a summary of really important and, in some cases, government-funded work that was done to understand the causes and effects of sexual and gender violence. What does it mean that the Trump administration doesn’t want the public to have that information?” This article has been updated to reflect the standard processes of digital archiving that take place when a new administration comes into the White House. CORRECTION : This article previously suggested that the removal of the report from the White House site was in some way unusual. As the White House notes, such removals are not uncommon in the routine transition between administrations.",47.32,12.6,14.3,548,548,"administrations

At one point a car plowed into an anti-racist group amid clashes between white supremacist activists, some armed, and anti-fascist protesters. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) declared a state of emergency on Saturday afternoon. President Donald Trump blamed “many sides” for the unrest. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a federal investigation into the violence at the rally. The FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia have also launched a civil rights investigation into the fatal car crash. CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. ― Thousands of white supremacists and armed militia groups faced off with counter-protesters during a violent and chaotic rally that raged for hours in this Virginia city on Saturday, resulting in the deaths of at least three people. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), who declared a state of emergency Saturday afternoon, condemned the violence during a press conference that evening, sending a message to the white supremacists. “Our message is plain and simple: Go home. You are not wanted in this great commonwealth,” he said. “Shame on you.” “Please go home and never come back. Take your hatred, and take your bigotry,” McAuliffe added. Charlottesville Police Chief Al Thomas said 35 people were treated for injuries by city personnel on Saturday, with injuries ranging from minor to life-threatening. Three people died Saturday, including a 32-year-old woman who was hit by a car that plowed into a group of counter-demonstrators and two others who perished in a helicopter crash near the protests. James Alex Fields Jr., 20, was arrested in connection with the car incident. He was charged with one count of second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of failing to stop at an accident resulting in a death, police Col. Martin Kumer told HuffPost. “It was just terrifying,” said 23-year-old Thomas Pilnik, a Charlottesville resident who witnessed the crash. “I remember people flying into me, telling me to run and get out of the way and watching people fly like they were just bowling pins.” As of 10 p.m. Eastern on Saturday , police had made three other arrests related to the rally: “You came here today to hurt people and you did hurt people,” McAuliffe said at Saturday’s press conference. Groups in Charlottesville beat each other with flagpoles and bats, threw punches, chanted slogans and used chemical sprays on each other at a downtown park. Some reporters covering the event were doused in raw sewage. “There was a cloud,” said a witness, who asked not to be named. “Things were flying. Most people managed to get out of the way.” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Saturday night that U.S. Attorney Rick Mountcastle has opened a federal investigation into the violence at the rally, with the full support of the Justice Department. The U.S. attorney’s office and regional FBI office also announced a civil rights investigation into the circumstances surrounding the deadly car crash. “The violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice,” Sessions said in a statement. “When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated.” The “Unite the Right” rally was promoted by white nationalist Richard Spencer and drew several different groups, including activists from the so-called “alt-right,” Nazis, Ku Klux Klan members and other white supremacists, some of whom dressed in militia uniforms and were openly carrying long guns. Counter-demonstrators and anti-fascist groups also attended. After demonstrations got heated Friday night, tensions were running high even before the rally officially began at noon, with members of the “alt-right” chanting the Nazi phrase “Blood and soil!” and “White lives matter!” as they marched toward Emancipation Park. With Confederate flags and Nazi memorabilia on full display, they also chanted “Fuck you faggots!” James Allsup, who was in Charlottesville for the “Unite the Right” rally, told Mediaite that “white people are tired of being told by the cosmopolitan elites that we are the problem.” “This is the biggest racist rally in recent memory,” a 23-year-old anti-fascist from Michigan, who wouldn’t give his name, told HuffPost. “And we are all out here opposing these motherfuckers and trying to get a temperature check where the right is ― where the far right is at ― and how they’re organizing, and where we can apply radical strategies to defeat fascism.” Early Saturday, McAuliffe asked on Twitter for a stop to the violence. As violence among the groups grew on Saturday morning, some fled the scene, while others coughed and cried from the chemical sprays. Two fences and a line of cops helped separate the opposing groups, though police did not immediately intervene in the violence. Police donned riot gear as fights escalated. Meanwhile, hundreds more white supremacists joined in the fray through the afternoon, making their way under a banner hung by the city that read “Diversity makes us stronger.” Those standing on the sidelines were baffled as to why police weren’t immediately stopping the skirmishes. “If this were Ferguson, riot gear, tear gas, everything would have been used,” said Anthony Bennett, a pastor from Connecticut, referring to the Missouri town where protests broke out in August 2014 after Darren Wilson, at the time a police officer, shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager. “There’s a different standard here in Charlottesville.” Unidentified militia members brandishing guns also showed up at the scene. Just minutes before the planned noon rally was set to begin, police threatened arrest for “ unlawful assembly .” Thousands of people began to disperse, but it wasn’t immediately clear where they were going. Eventually, arrests began. Late Friday night, a white nationalist march at the University of Virginia campus painted a sobering picture of what was to come. A torch-bearing procession of hundreds that included Spencer, at least one man wearing a Nazi SS T-shirt and another carrying a bat, ended with a clash at the campus rotunda where a Thomas Jefferson statue stands. Spencer admitted on Twitter that a group surrounded counter-protesters at the statue. Counter-protesters told HuffPost that some among their ranks were then hit with some type of irritant Friday night ― they claim it was Mace, unleashed by the white supremacists. Protesters on the fringe left, who come to these events to battle the fringe right, often try to hide their identities for fear of retaliation. Some counter-protesters threatened a HuffPost reporter with a gun when he attempted to photograph, from a distance, those recovering from the irritant. “Don’t make me use my gun on you,” a woman said, grabbing a holster on her hip. Punches and torches were thrown during the fracas, but local police eventually dispersed the crowds. President Donald Trump did little to denounce the white supremacists, instead saying Saturday that “many sides” were responsible for the violence. “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides ― on many sides,” Trump said at a ceremony for the signing of a bill to reform the Veterans Affairs health care system. “It’s been going on for a long time in our country, not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama. It’s been going on for a long, long time.” Comments from state and local officials addressed the racism more directly. Charlottesville Mayor Michael Signer spoke out against the white supremacists who gathered in his city. “They do not agree with the rules of democracy and they are on the losing side of history,” he said during a press conference Saturday evening. McAuliffe spoke directly to white supremacists during the press conference, reminding them that “we are a nation of immigrants.” McAuliffe said he spoke to Trump on Saturday and told the president he’d be willing to work together, despite their differences, to help prevent this kind of violence in the future. “There has got to be a movement in this country to bring people together,” McAuliffe said. The rally Saturday was thinly disguised on Facebook as an event in support of the statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee downtown, which is slated for removal as the city works to respect diverse voices in its telling of American history. It’s part of a nationwide effort to remove Confederate monuments from public property. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, more than 60 Confederate symbols have been removed from city- and state-owned land across the U.S. since avowed white supremacist Dylann Roof massacred nine parishioners at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. Most recently, the city of New Orleans toppled four statues honoring the Confederacy. “These efforts have made us a target for folks around the country who oppose telling the full story of race,” Signer told HuffPost on Friday. “They don’t want the narrative changed or to tell the full story of race. I think this will have the effect of redoubling our progress. To become an honest society, I don’t think we have any choice but to tell the full story.” The rally’s real purpose, however, shines through in the event’s advertising, which looks a lot like Nazi propaganda and reads like a poorly billed concert: Spencer’s followers claimed that that violence was coming to Charlottesville in the form of “roving mobs” of Antifa ― groups of black-clad, masked anti-fascists, anarchists and socialists. It’s a scare tactic that white nationalists use regularly to pull crowds of people to a city in defense of it. They were able to draw hundreds to Gettysburg over the Fourth of July weekend after claiming members of Antifa were coming to desecrate graves. Antifa never came, but the Ku Klux Klan did, and the only bloodshed came when a lone patriot shot himself in the leg . The weeks and days leading up to the rally in Charlottesville had the city gearing up for war. The city had seen this type of menacing before: White supremacists showed up with torches at the Lee monument in May, an act that evoked Ku Klux Klan symbolism. Some businesses closed down Saturday to keep employees safe. Others reportedly opened their doors solely as a safe space in case of an emergency. Some locals were prepared to take drastic measures to protect their city. “As a lifelong resident of Charlottesville and a mother of two, this is about making the world more equitable for my children,” Leslie Scott-Jones of Solidarity C’Ville wrote in a news release. “I am not naive about the urgent threat of August 12 , nor do I believe the threat ends there... My family has been here since the 1700′s, this is my home, and I have no other choice than to protect it.” This article has been updated with new details, including comments from Trump and anti-fascist demonstrators, information about Fields and information about the various investigations into Saturday’s events.

Just last month, the Jenners came under fire for appropriating Chola culture in a deleted Instagram post.

In June, the sisters pulled a line of $125 vintage T-shirts that displayed their faces over images of Metallica, Pink Floyd, the Doors, Kiss and Ozzy Osbourne as well as the late music artists Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G.

Voletta Wallace, mother of Christopher, spoke out about the offensive T-shirts on Instagram . “I am not sure who told @kyliejenner and @kendalljenner that they had the right to do this,” she wrote. “The disrespect of these girls to not even reach out to me or anyone connected to the estate baffles me. I have no idea why they feel they can exploit the deaths of 2pac and my Son Christopher to sell a t-shirt. This is disrespectful, disgusting, and exploitation at its worst!!!” Shortly after Voletta spoke out, the Jenners issued an apology and removed the shirts from their store. “We deeply apologize to anyone that has been upset and/or offended, especially to the families of the artists.

In reality, the Post did no such thing. Vittert’s comments came during an on-air discussion with conservative radio host Jeff Katz about a handful of recent errors in reporting on the Trump administration. “I think it’s inexcusable,” Vittert said after Katz claimed many newsrooms were acting on behalf of the so-called resistance movement with little regard for the facts. “You talk about this, and at least for one reporter it turned out to be inexcusable, he doesn’t have a job anymore, and that’s from The Washington Post.” “He apologized, and he now has since left,” he said again later in the segment. Vittert was referring to Post reporter Dave Weigel, who retweeted a widely shared photo of a sparsely filled Florida venue where Trump was scheduled to speak on Friday. “Packed to the rafters,” Weigel wrote with the image, quoting Trump’s own description of the rally. Trump, who often fixates on the sizes of his crowds at speaking engagements, went after Weigel over the tweet and said the photo showed the venue “hours” before he arrived ― though that detail has been the subject of debate . Trump tweeted that the Post should issue an apology and a retraction ― despite the photo appearing only on Weigel’s personal Twitter account ― and called for his firing. The Post has not done so. It issued a statement standing by Weigel’s integrity as a reporter, noting that he promptly apologized to Trump and deleted the tweet.

Mueller has asked Deutsche Bank to share information on accounts held by the Trump family as part of his investigation into Russia’s alleged attempts to influence the 2016 election, Reuters reported Tuesday. The bank has loaned the Trump Organization millions of dollars over the years. Trump does not like revealing details of his finances. He still hasn’t released his tax returns, unlike other presidents in recent history. And in July, Trump implied that he would consider firing Mueller if he started looking into his finances. From his interview with New York Times reporters Peter Baker, Michael S. Schmidt and Maggie Haberman: SCHMIDT: Last thing, if Mueller was looking at your finances and your family finances, unrelated to Russia — is that a red line? HABERMAN: Would that be a breach of what his actual charge is? TRUMP: I would say yeah. I would say yes. By the way, I would say, I don’t — I don’t — I mean, it’s possible there’s a condo or something, so, you know, I sell a lot of condo units, and somebody from Russia buys a condo, who knows? I don’t make money from Russia. ... SCHMIDT: But if he was outside that lane, would that mean he’d have to go? [crosstalk] HABERMAN: Would you consider ― TRUMP: No, I think that’s a violation. Look, this is about Russia. So I think if he wants to go, my finances are extremely good, my company is an unbelievably successful company. And actually, when I do my filings, peoples say, “Man.” People have no idea how successful this is. It’s a great company. But I don’t even think about the company anymore. I think about this. ’Cause one thing, when you do this, companies seem very trivial. O.K.? I really mean that. They seem very trivial. But I have no income from Russia. I don’t do business with Russia. ... HABERMAN: Would you fire Mueller if he went outside of certain parameters of what his charge is? [crosstalk] SCHMIDT: What would you do? [crosstalk] TRUMP: I can’t, I can’t answer that question because I don’t think it’s going to happen. The White House did not immediately return a request for comment. Trump has reportedly considered firing Mueller in the past. Last week, after Mueller charged Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, with lying to the FBI, speculation picked up again that the president may take the drastic step. “I would worry in a real way that Donald Trump may preemptively pardon some people, and I still worry in a real way that Donald Trump may decide to cause the firing of Robert Mueller ,” Preet Bharara, the former U.S. attorney who was ousted by Trump, said on Monday. With Flynn now cooperating with Mueller, the investigation is moving closer and closer to Trump and his inner circle ― including his son-in-law and trusted adviser, Jared Kushner . Trump, of course, is in this situation because he initially fired James Comey. The FBI director said Trump approached him and tried to get him to ease up on the Russia investigation and to specifically be lenient toward Flynn ― who lied about his interactions with Russian officials before the inauguration. After the disclosure of the pressure Trump had placed on Comey, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller as special counsel . UPDATE: 3:32 p.m. ― Trump ignored a reporter’s shouted question about the “red line” Tuesday during an Oval Office event. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders punted on a similar question Tuesday afternoon, referring to the statement of Trump’s personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow, who denied that there were any subpoenas for financial information.",64.71,8,10.4,631,631,"trump

The New York Post noted that Chase bears a slight resemblance to Cruz’ wife, Heidi. Chase suspects he may have liked the conservative outfit that she wore in the scene. The Florida-based porn actress has fond memories of the production, which co-starred Bruce Venture and Avalon Heart. “[Heart] played my step-daughter who stayed home pretending she was sick,” Chase explained. “I see her having sex with her boyfriend and, of course, it turns me on.” Chase said she had no problem getting into character. “I always try to get into the situation and there’s only been one or two scenes [in an 8-year career] that didn’t turn me on.” As a resident of central Florida, Chase hasn’t been able to see the reaction to the scene because her web access has been intermittent after Hurricane Irma. “I hate that it happened when I can’t see it, but when I found out it was trending, it was one of those OMG moments,” she said. Chase was unaware that Ted Cruz has argued for the ban of sex toys in Texas, but she isn’t surprised. “Most politicians are hypocrites,” she said, adding that politically, she does lean toward the Republican side, but considers herself a moderate.

The article, entitled “The Danger of President Pence,” details various viewpoints held by the socially conservative vice president that clash with Trump’s. Two sources told the magazine that Trump has teased Pence about his positions on religion, abortion and the LGBTQ community. “A longtime associate” of Trump and Pence was quoted in the article saying that the president likes to let his VP “know who’s boss” and that Trump asks people who stop by Pence’s office, “Did Mike make you pray?” After a legal adviser told Trump and Pence that many states would probably legalize abortion if the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Trump was said to have turned to Pence: ‘You see?’ Trump asked Pence. ‘You’ve wasted all this time and energy on it, and it’s not going to end abortion anyway.’ When that meeting shifted to discuss gay rights, according to the article, Trump pointed to Pence and joked, “Don’t ask that guy — he wants to hang them all!” Pence’s press secretary, Alyssa Farah, told Washington Blade reporter Chris Johnson that the New Yorker article was “filled with unsubstantiated, unsourced claims that are untrue and offensive.” It was unclear whether Farah’s statement specifically addressed Trump’s joke. Pence’s views on equal rights have long stirred concern in the LGBTQ community. As Indiana governor, he signed his state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act in 2015, which essentially gave businesses the right to refuse to serve gay people. He has supported so-called gay conversion therapy and has been called “ one of the most anti-LGBT politicians out there. ” This piece has been updated to include comment from the vice president’s office.",59.64,9.9,12.6,300,300,"pence

Maurice Symonette, who has also called himself “Michael the Black Man” and Maurice Woodside, was an eye-catching figure during the rally in Phoenix. Trump supporters lauded him on social media for his T-shirt reading “Trump & Republicans Are Not Racist.” Perhaps they should have checked him out first. Between his signs and his shirt that night, Symonette was also showcasing two websites: blacksfortrump2020.com and gods2.com. Click on either and you’ll be taken to honestfact.com, which spews a range of rambling conspiracy theories. One claims to link Hillary Clinton with the Islamic State and the criminal gang MS-13. Another declares that “Cherokees are the real KKK Racist Slave Masters, not White Gentiles who are Black Peoples Republican Emancipators!” Symonette has uploaded a number of long-winded videos on YouTube , often as “Michael the Black Man.” There he discusses his theories on race wars involving Democrats, gentiles, Canaanites and the Cherokee. Speaking to a Chicago radio station on Wednesday, Symonette said that he arrived early at the Phoenix rally and that allowed him to secure a prominent place close behind the president. “I wasn’t placed [behind Trump], I put myself there,” he told WLS-AM 890. “I’m glad I was there so I could get the message out, tell people what’s going on with Democrats and the Cherokee Indians that are absolutely destroying the black man and the white man of America.” When the radio hosts expressed surprise that he would get such a coveted seat, Symonette added, “I don’t really know how it works. They have seen me a lot of times.” Photos posted online certainly support that statement. Symonette’s Facebook page shows pictures of him posing with a number of high-profile Republican politicians and Trump supporters, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and the president’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr . There are also videos of him at a rally with Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) and celebrating with Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway outside what appears to be Trump Tower in New York City. And last year, the Miami New Times reported that Symonette and his signs had scored prime seating at more than one Trump rally in Florida. Symonette has popped up in a number of mugshots as well. His rap sheet lists arrests for racketeering, firebombing, conspiracy in 14 murders, and grand theft auto, the New Times reported in 2011. None of the charges stuck, however. “I don’t smoke. I don’t drink. I don’t support any kind of activity that goes against what God asks us to do,” he told the New Times back then. “You can check my record. I’ve never been convicted of anything.” In the early 1990s, Symonette, who then went by the name of Maurice Woodside, was arrested along with other members of an African-American cult called the Temple of Love, the New Times reported. Its leader, Yahweh ben Yahweh (formerly known as Hulon Mitchell Jr.), was later sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for conspiring to commit murder. Symonette was acquitted. During Wednesday’s radio interview, Symonette defended Yahweh ben Yahweh as “not violent.” He had told the New Times that he was 21 when he met the Temple of Love leader and became enthralled by the man’s preachings. “He got me by just walking up and saying, ‘All white people are the Devil,’” Symonette recalled. “I was a real militant race warrior right then, so I said, ‘Whoa! Yeah, that’s right!’” Symonette’s views have changed over the years. Long after Yahweh ben Yahweh went to prison, his former follower started participating in political protests against Barack Obama. In 2008, Symonette reportedly claimed that then-Sen. Obama had tried to have him assassinated. Last year, he tried to paint Hillary Clinton as the presidential candidate who was too close to racists, by accusing her of once “ kissing the head of the Ku Klux Klan ” and saying, “That’s my mentor.” The trouble with that conspiracy theory was that the man Clinton greeted was the late Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), who by the time she praised him had long since evolved from a one-time member of the KKK to a strong supporter of advancing civil rights.

According to the network, the charges are sealed under a federal judge’s order. It remains unclear who has been indicted and on what charges. The person or persons indicted could be taken into custody as soon as Monday, CNN said. Federal officials have not yet validated the CNN report, and a spokesman for Mueller declined to comment to Reuters. However, if confirmed, it would mark a major development in the special counsel’s probe. “If anybody thinks the Mueller investigation is going to be wrapping up, this decision guarantees it will go well into 2018,” CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller in May, following President Donald Trump ’s controversial decision to fire FBI Director James Comey amid the agency’s investigation into possible Russian meddling during the 2016 presidential election. Mueller is a former prosecutor and served as FBI director from 2001 to 2013. Mueller was tasked with overseeing the investigation into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the election, along with any matters that directly arise from the investigation. Since then, reports have emerged that Mueller was investigating whether Trump attempted to obstruct justice. Mueller’s team is reportedly also looking into a dossier containing explosive, unverified allegations regarding Trump and his associates, compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele for the research firm Fusion GPS. Mueller’s team is also investigating Trump’s associates. The team is reportedly looking into possible tax and financial crimes by Paul Manafort. Trump’s former campaign manager was forced out in August 2016 over his past business dealings with pro-Russian figures in Ukraine. Manafort’s lobbying firm disclosed in June it was paid $17.1 million for work on behalf of a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine from 2012 to 2014, without Manafort being registered with the Department of Justice as a foreign agent at the time. FBI agents raided Manafort’s home in July, seizing documents and other items. Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to Trump, said that he had spoken to Manafort at 5 p.m. Friday and, as of that time, Manafort “knew nothing of this,” referring to the report of the indictments. Stone’s statement didn’t clarify matters ― a suspect wouldn’t be informed of an indictment ― but it indirectly indicated that Stone and his friend of 40 years (and former business partner) were checking in with each other about where things stood at the close of business this week. A suspect would never be informed of an indictment. Later Friday night, Stone told HuffPost that he had spoken to Manafort at 8:30 p.m. and that the former campaign chairman had “said nothing.” Stone added that he thought Mueller’s primary investigative focus was an obstruction case rather than the more central issue of collusion, which presumably would be the greater risk to Manafort. Another close mutual friend of Trump and Manafort, speaking on background to be candid, said that he expected the former campaign manager to be indicted, though he had heard nothing specific as of late Friday . “It’s a shame what’s going to happen to Paul,” the friend said. “He wasn’t even a Trump guy.” Trump has fiercely denied allegations that his campaign colluded with the Russians and has referred to the reports about Mueller investigating questions of possible obstruction of justice as “the single greatest witch hunt in American political history.” Friday’s news of the reported indictments emerged just hours after Dana Boente, the top federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, submitted his resignation . Boente was simultaneously serving as the head of the Department if Justice’s National Security Division and had been acting attorney general earlier this year following Trump’s firing of former acting Attorney General Sally Yates. One of Mueller’s grand juries was reportedly impaneled in Boente’s Eastern District of Virginia, which is commonly referred to as a “rocket docket” because of the fast pace of cases in the federal judicial district. Boente had served at the Justice Department for 33 years and is planning to stay on until his successor is confirmed. The reason for his departure is unclear. This article has been updated with later comments from Roger Stone. Howard Fineman and Ryan Reilly contributed reporting. CORRECTION : An earlier version of this article said Sally Yates resigned. She was fired by Trump.",52.09,10.7,13.1,746,746,"mueller

Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill ordered a criminal investigation Friday into the actions of Detective Jeff Payne who aggressively arrested nurse Alex Wubbels on July 26 for refusing to draw blood from a severely injured patient. Payne has been placed on administrative leave, The Associated Press reported. The Salt Lake City Police Department also said Friday that two of its employees have been placed on administrative leave while the investigation is underway. It is unclear if Payne is one of the employees mentioned in the agency’s statement. As seen in the above video, taken by Payne’s body camera, Wubbels, the head nurse of the University of Utah Hospital’s burn unit, remains calm as she explains policy after Payne insists on collecting the blood sample of an unconscious patient. Wubbels explains she is simply trying to her job, telling the detective “three things that allow us to [give blood samples] are if you have an electronic warrant, patient consent or patient under arrest, and neither of those things … the patient can’t consent. He told me repeatedly that he doesn’t have a warrant and the patient is not under arrest.” The footage of the arrest shows Payne interrupting Wubbels as she continues to explain the policy to him before placing her in handcuffs, which causes a brief scuffle between the two. The video, made public Friday, sparked a wave of criticism over Payne’s confrontation with a nurse who appears to be following hospital protocol. Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski and Police Chief Mike Brown apologized for Payne’s actions and promised investigations from Internal Affairs and the Civilian Review Board. “I was alarmed by what I saw in the video with our officer” and Wubbels, Brown said in a joint statement . “I am sad at the rift this has caused between law-enforcement and the nurses we work so closely with. I want to be clear, we take this very seriously.” After Payne placed Wubbels in handcuffs, the nurse was released without being charged for anything. In fact, a 2016 Supreme Court ruling suggests that the nurse was right to not allow Payne to obtain a blood alcohol test without a warrant . According Payne’s report obtained by the Tribune, the detective said he was advised by his watch commander, Lt. James Tracy, to arrest Wubbels for interfering with a police investigation. He also said he needed the blood sample to protect, not punish, the patient. After seeing the video, National Nurses United, which is currently sponsoring a campaign to raise awareness of hospital workplace violence, publicly denounced Payne and the Salt Lake City Police Department. “As the videos and news accounts make clear, there is no excuse for this assault, or her arrest, which sends a chilling message about the safety of nurses and the rights of patients ,” said Jean Ross, the organization’s co-president. Police spokeswoman Christina Judd told AP that the police department initiated an internal investigation within hours of the July 26 confrontation. Since the arrest, Payne has been suspended from the department’s blood draw unit. After the video made rounds online late Friday morning, District Attorney Gill asked Brown to find an outside agency to look into the investigation, the Tribune reported. Later on Friday, the mayor’s office announced that the Unified Police Department would be conducting the criminal investigation. Wubbels said at a news conference Thursday that she felt “betrayed,” “angry” and “confused,” and warned that she may consider taking legal action over the confrontation. However, in a statement to the press released Friday, Wubbels said she had accepted the “sincere apologies” of Police Chief Brown and Mayor Biskupski, according to Utah’s ABC 4 News . “I look forward to working with both of them to help promote further civil dialogue and education,” she said. “The common goal of all public service professionals should be to provide the best care to our fellow citizens.” The University of Utah Hospital stands by Wubbels decision to protect the patient, saying she “followed procedures and protocols,” according to the New York Post. Judd, the spokeswoman for the police, told AP on Friday that the police department recently updated its blood-draw policy to align it with the hospital’s policy, adding that officers have received additional training on the matter.",47.42,12.5,13.3,735,735,"wubbels

chilling message","The police officer seen in a viral video arresting a nurse in Salt Lake City is now under criminal investigation, according to The Salt Lake Tribune.
Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill ordered a criminal investigation Friday into the actions of Detective Jeff Payne who aggressively arrested nurse Alex Wubbels on July 26 for refusing to draw blood from a severely injured patient.
The Salt Lake City Police Department also said Friday that two of its employees have been placed on administrative leave while the investigation is underway.
As seen in the above video, taken by Payne’s body camera, Wubbels, the head nurse of the University of Utah Hospital’s burn unit, remains calm as she explains policy after Payne insists on collecting the blood sample of an unconscious patient.
Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski and Police Chief Mike Brown apologized for Payne’s actions and promised investigations from Internal Affairs and the Civilian Review Board.
According Payne’s report obtained by the Tribune, the detective said he was advised by his watch commander, Lt. James Tracy, to arrest Wubbels for interfering with a police investigation.
After seeing the video, National Nurses United, which is currently sponsoring a campaign to raise awareness of hospital workplace violence, publicly denounced Payne and the Salt Lake City Police Department.
However, in a statement to the press released Friday, Wubbels said she had accepted the “sincere apologies” of Police Chief Brown and Mayor Biskupski, according to Utah’s ABC 4 News ."

The man’s response was quick and unequivocal: “You can come in.” When she opened the door, “He was at the computer, masturbating,” Cecilia recalled. She was overcome with shock and embarrassment. Judging from the satisfied look on the man’s face, that was the whole idea. “I felt nasty,” recalled Cecilia, who asked that her last name and the hotel not be identified. “You’d expect that to happen to people in a jail but not in regular work. I felt like crying.” It wasn’t the only time Cecilia had dealt with extreme forms of sexual harassment in her three decades working in downtown hotels. A male guest once answered her knock by opening the door naked. Just a month and a half ago, a younger colleague confided to Cecilia that a male guest had tried to embrace her while she was in his room. Cecilia escorted the shaken housekeeper to the hotel’s security team to report the incident. Since the allegations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein were first revealed last month, more and more women have stepped forward with stories of sexual harassment and assault at work. Their bravery in speaking out has toppled powerful men’s careers in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and Washington. But much less attention has been paid to the rampant harassment in blue-collar workplaces, particularly the hotel industry. Many of the stories that have hit front pages ― Weinstein, journalist Mark Halperin , comedian Louis C.K. ― center on powerful men who preyed on underlings or colleagues in hotel rooms ― a trend that would surprise no woman who’s ever worked as a housekeeper. If famous A-list actresses must deal with unwanted advances in the privacy of a hotel suite, imagine the vulnerability of an immigrant woman cleaning the room alone, for close to minimum wage, plus tips. “Frankly, I don’t think much of the public understands what housekeepers go through just to clean these rooms and carry out the work,” said Maria Elena Durazo, a labor leader with the hospitality union Unite Here. For several years Durazo’s union has advocated for housekeepers to be given handheld, wireless panic buttons that can alert hotel security when a worker feels threatened ― a sign of how dire it views the problem of sexual predation in the hotel industry. After working to negotiate the use of panic buttons in their employer contracts, the union is now lobbying city councils to mandate them through legislation so that all workers have access to them, union and non-union alike. But, according to Durazo, the panic buttons only go so far in addressing the more fundamental problem: an imbalance of economic power between perpetrators and their victims, especially when the victims are working in or near poverty. “We have to do something to equalize the power so that women really have the ability to speak up, without having to risk their livelihood,” she said. “That goes for whether you’re a housekeeper or a food server or a big-time actor.” Last year, Unite Here surveyed roughly 500 of its Chicago area members who work in hotels and casinos as housekeepers and servers, many of them Latino and Asian immigrants. The results were disturbing: 58 percent of hotel workers and 77 percent of casino workers said they had been sexually harassed by a guest. 49 percent of hotel workers said they had experienced a guest answering the door naked or otherwise exposing himself. 56 percent of hotel workers who’d reported harassment said they didn’t feel safe on the job afterward. 65 percent of casino cocktail servers said a guest had touched or tried to touch them without permission. Nearly 40 percent of casino workers said they’d been pressured for a date or a sexual favor. Nereyda Soto, 25, was working in a hotel restaurant in Long Beach, Calif., two years ago when a guest’s attention over several days started to feel like stalking. The man repeatedly called Soto over to his table whenever he dined in the restaurant, asking her personal questions, such as whether she had a boyfriend. Relatively new to the job at the time, Soto didn’t feel comfortable telling a paying guest to buzz off. When Soto came by his table to collect the man’s check one night, she found a hotel key card along with his payment. “He said, ‘I’d love to see how you look outside this uniform. You should meet me in my room.’” Soto was mortified, but she didn’t tell her boss at the time. “I didn’t tell management, and I didn’t tell security, because he didn’t technically touch me and the customer is always right in this industry,” Soto explained. Even if she did report it, she didn’t expect her company would do anything about it, and she didn’t want to come off as a troublemaker: “I didn’t want my name to be out there. So I just let it go.” The experience got Soto involved in a campaign in Long Beach to bring panic buttons to the city’s hotel workers. Led by labor groups, the idea of outfitting housekeepers with a way to alert hotel security started to catch on in 2011, after French politician Dominique Strauss-Kahn was accused of assaulting a housekeeper at a New York hotel. The following year, the New York Hotel Trades Council won a contract for 30,000 workers that guaranteed the use of panic buttons for housekeepers covered under the agreement. In Long Beach, Soto’s union took a different tack: They tried to win the panic buttons through legislation so that the protections would be extended to all of the city’s hotel workers, not just those covered by a union contract. The local chamber of commerce campaigned against the regulation, estimating that compliance would collectively cost affected hotels about $3 million. After a yearlong effort, the Long Beach City Council narrowly rejected the panic button proposal in a 5-4 vote in September. A similar panic button measure Unite Here pushed in Chicago recently fared much better. The City Council passed a “Hands Off, Pants On” ordinance last month, which requires hotels to outfit housekeepers and others who work alone in guest rooms or bathrooms with panic buttons by July 1, 2018. It also requires hotels to develop sexual harassment policies that show workers how to report incidents and provide them with time to file complaints with the police. Unlike the union contract workers secured in New York, the Chicago ordinance will apply to hotels citywide, regardless of whether workers are in a union. A similar ordinance was passed last year in Seattle. The Chicago campaign probably got a boost from the findings of its member survey on harassment, which Jorge Ramirez, president of the Chicago Federation of Labor, said he found “astonishing.” Ramirez said the city’s hotel lobby didn’t actively fight the measure. The new national conversation about sexual harassment at work will make it harder to do so, he predicted. “We didn’t see them out there with pompoms, but they didn’t speak out against it, either,” Ramirez said. “I think the industry would have a hard time opposing this, especially with everything that’s come to light in the last few months.” The housekeepers wore “No Harveys in Chicago” T-shirts to mark the ordinance’s passage. Among those celebrating was Cecilia, who had spent months rallying her colleagues around the cause. She hopes the new panic buttons will bring a sense of safety to workers like the young housekeeper she helped not even two months ago. “It’s more security, and more support,” Cecilia said. “Trust me. You shouldn’t be scared to work.” CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said Chicago was the first city to pass panic button legislation.

On Sunday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson suggested that the president of the United States does not speak for American values. After deflecting questions from Fox News’ Chris Wallace about President Donald Trump ’s failure to condemn white supremacist groups who incited deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, by saying that he and the State Department “represent America’s values,” Tillerson said that “ the president speaks for himself .” Tillerson’s statement caps a tumultuous two weeks in which Trump demonstrated that he has abandoned essential duties of the office, failing to provide basic, measured responses to violence and natural disasters. Throughout last week, he continued to defend his widely condemned response to the violence in Charlottesville — in which he delayed and then backtracked on a denunciation of white nationalist, KKK and neo-Nazi groups — including during a campaign-style rally in Phoenix. Trump’s failure to provide the most elementary leadership earned criticism from lawmakers and leaders around the world — even from a United Nations panel on combating racial discrimination , which expressed deep concern about “the example this failure could set for the rest of the world.” The night Hurricane Harvey slammed into Texas, unleashing potentially historic rainfall, Trump announced he was pardoning former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, who illegally targeted Latinos and was convicted of criminal contempt for violating a court order. In doing so, he bypassed the Department of Justice’s normal pardon procedures. (Trump reportedly asked his attorney general about closing the criminal case against Arpaio months earlier.) On Sunday, as residents of Texas began evaluating the flooding and damage from the storm, Trump issued a stream of tweets congratulating authorities and himself for the recovery effort, which he bragged was “going well!” The tweets about Hurricane Harvey were sandwiched between posts on unrelated topics, including the president’s personal grievances . For example, Trump immediately followed the announcement that he would visit Texas with a tweet boasting about his election victory in a different state, while suggesting that he would help unseat the state’s Democratic senator. Tillerson is not the only administration official attempting to distance himself from the president in recent days. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis can be heard telling U.S. troops in Jordan to “hold the line until our country gets back to understanding and respecting each other,” in a video posted Thursday on Facebook. Mattis also said the U.S. will “get the power of inspiration back,” which many interpreted as criticism of Trump’s leadership. It’s unclear exactly when Mattis made the impromptu remarks, though he stopped in Jordan during his overseas trip last week. “You’re a great example for our country right now, and it has got problems,” Mattis said in the video . “You know it and I know it. It’s got problems we don’t have in the military. And you just hold the line, my fine soldiers and sailors and airmen and Marines.” The president’s economic adviser, Gary Cohn, told the Financial Times that he contemplated resigning after Trump’s Charlottesville remarks , saying the administration “can and must do better in consistently and unequivocally condemning these groups.” Of course, many in the Trump administration still unambiguously defend the president. After Trump delivered a scripted but conspicuously vague speech on his Afghanistan war strategy, Vice President Mike Pence insisted Trump’s primetime address signaled “American resolve.” Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said the speech demonstrated “the signs of a president.” The next day, Trump reverted to form at his no-holds-barred Arizona rally, making it next to impossible to believe that he will treat the presidency with the gravity the office is meant to hold.",41.19,12.9,14.7,603,603,"trump

Irma, which at its peak was a Category 5 hurricane with 185 mph winds, has left more than 5.8 million people in Florida without power, according to the state Division of Emergency Management. Roughly 83 percent of Monroe County, which includes the Florida Keys and Everglades National Park, is in the dark. The storm, which devastated the Caribbean last week, is expected to become a tropical depression by Tuesday, the National Hurricane Center said. Irma first made landfall in the Lower Florida Keys a little after 9 a.m. on Sunday, bringing ferocious winds and intense rainfall to the small beachside towns. The storm then headed for Florida’s southwestern coast, making landfall again at 3:35 p.m. on Marco Island and weakening to a Category 2 shortly thereafter. Officials reported four storm-related deaths and urged Floridians to stay off the roads. The sheriff’s office for Monroe County, which includes the Florida Keys, said on Saturday that one man had died in a car crash during the storm. Separately, a Florida sheriff’s deputy was helping supply an evacuation shelter in Hardee County when the vehicle she was driving crashed into one driven by a state prison employee, killing them both. Even as the storm’s wrath began to subside, many parts of Florida were virtual ghost towns , with stores and restaurants closed and no gasoline available at stations. Shelters were packed with people seeking safety. Families who sought refuge in hotels sat in the lobbies playing games with their children to keep their minds off what might be happening to their homes. An estimated 208,000 people across six states, as well as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, stayed in shelters on Sunday night, the Red Cross told HuffPost. Around 200,000 of those people were in Florida alone. Nearly 7 million people from multiple states in the storm’s path were told to evacuate their homes, according to The Associated Press . Meanwhile, residents in the Caribbean have begun the slow and painful process of rebuilding their lives after Irma devastated the region last week, leaving at least 38 people dead and almost completely destroying some islands. Travis Waldron, David Lohr and Sebastian Murdock contributed reporting from Florida.

At least one woman, who is not a Morgan Stanley employee but interacted with Ford in a professional capacity, was interviewed by Morgan Stanley’s HR department as part of the investigation. In two interviews with HuffPost, the woman alleged that Ford engaged in harassment, intimidation, and forcibly grabbed her one evening in Manhattan, leading her to seek aid from a building security guard. The incident took place several years ago when Ford and the woman were supposed to be meeting for professional reasons. Ford continued to contact her after the encounter until she wrote an email asking him to cease contact. The email, which was reviewed by HuffPost, shows that the woman emailed Ford after he repeatedly asked her to drinks. She asked him not to contact her anymore, citing his inappropriate conduct the evening where he forcibly grabbed and harassed her. Ford replied to the email by apologizing and agreeing not to contact her. “Hey very sorry. Meant no harm,” the email reads. “And I apologize for whatever I may have said or what was said. And my overtures are strictly professional. Again I apologize didn’t mean to be inappropriate at all. Sorry that impression was left.” HuffPost is not identifying the woman at her request but has reviewed emails that confirm her interactions with Ford and spoke to two people whom the woman confided in about the incident. One woman heard from Ford’s accuser the night of the incident and described her as “distraught, shocked, and frightened,” and said that she was concerned about any career ramifications should she report the incident. In a statement provided to HuffPost, Ford denied the allegations: “This simply did not happen. I have never forcibly grabbed any woman or man in my life. Having drinks and dinner for work is part of my job, and all of my outreach to the news reporter making these false allegations was professional and at the direction of my firm for business purposes. I support and have tremendous respect for the brave women now speaking out in this important national dialogue. False claims like this undermine the real silence breakers. I will now be bringing legal action against the reporter who has made these false claims about me as well as Morgan Stanley for improper termination.” John Singer, Ford’s employment counsel with the firm Singer Deutsch LLP, said “Morgan Stanley has still not told Harold directly of his termination, and unlike every other circumstance I’ve been in the company has refused provide me with a reason.” He added: “This all demonstrates how this was a matter of convenience during a hyper-sensitive time and not based on real facts.” Ford comes from a prominent political family in Tennessee. His father, Harold Ford Sr., held a congressional seat for 12 terms before retiring, leaving his son to run for the seat, a race which he won handily. Ford served in the House for nearly 10 years before deciding to run for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Republican Bill Frist. Ford lost that hotly contested 2006 race by fewer than three points to current Republican Sen. Bob Corker. Since leaving Congress in 2007, Ford has worked for two financial services companies, first for Merrill Lynch and then Morgan Stanley, which he joined in 2011 as a managing director. At the time Morgan Stanley announced the hire, The New York Times described Ford’s role as a rainmaker of sorts: “ Mr. Ford will be responsible for ‘building business opportunities’ for clients, Morgan Stanley said. He will manage relationships with corporate directors, senior executives and institutional investors, as well as private clients.” Ford also serves as a paid on-air political analyst for NBC/MSNBC and regularly appears on the MSNBC program “Morning Joe.” This story has been updated to include statements from Ford and Singer.",61.56,9.2,11.9,688,688,"ford

dialogue","Former Democratic Congressman Harold Ford Jr. has been fired for misconduct by Morgan Stanley after facing a human resources investigation into allegations of misconduct, a company spokeswoman confirmed.
At least one woman, who is not a Morgan Stanley employee but interacted with Ford in a professional capacity, was interviewed by Morgan Stanley’s HR department as part of the investigation.
In two interviews with HuffPost, the woman alleged that Ford engaged in harassment, intimidation, and forcibly grabbed her one evening in Manhattan, leading her to seek aid from a building security guard.
The email, which was reviewed by HuffPost, shows that the woman emailed Ford after he repeatedly asked her to drinks.
Ford replied to the email by apologizing and agreeing not to contact her.
Sorry that impression was left.” HuffPost is not identifying the woman at her request but has reviewed emails that confirm her interactions with Ford and spoke to two people whom the woman confided in about the incident.
I will now be bringing legal action against the reporter who has made these false claims about me as well as Morgan Stanley for improper termination.” John Singer, Ford’s employment counsel with the firm Singer Deutsch LLP, said “Morgan Stanley has still not told Harold directly of his termination, and unlike every other circumstance I’ve been in the company has refused provide me with a reason.” He added: “This all demonstrates how this was a matter of convenience during a hyper-sensitive time and not based on real facts.” Ford comes from a prominent political family in Tennessee.

I have never forced myself in any manner, on any woman. I certainly have never committed rape,” he wrote . PREVIOUSLY: Actress Kristina Cohen said in a lengthy Facebook post shared Monday that “ Gossip Girl ” star Ed Westwick raped her three years ago. Cohen, 27, said that she met Westwick, 30, through her boyfriend at the time, a producer who goes unnamed in the post. The incident occurred when the couple went over to actor’s house one night, she wrote. Cohen was taken aback when Westwick allegedly suggested “we should all fuck,” but her boyfriend convinced her to stay for dinner to avoid making their host uncomfortable. At Westwick’s suggestion, Cohen said she then retired to the guest room for a nap while her boyfriend tried to smooth things over. “So I went and laid down in the guest room where I eventually fell asleep, I was woken up abruptly by Ed on top of me, his fingers entering my body. I told him to stop, but he was strong,” Cohen wrote. “I fought him off as hard as I could but he grabbed my face in his hands, shaking me, telling me he wanted to fuck me. I was paralyzed, terrified. I couldn’t speak, I could no longer move. He held me down and raped me.” “It was a nightmare, and the days following weren’t any better,” she added. A representative for Westwick did not immediately return HuffPost’s request for comment. Cohen said that her boyfriend blamed her for the assault and cautioned against speaking out against Westwick for the sake of her career. Over the years, she has appeared in a handful of minor roles in projects including “Californication” and “The Middle,” as well as the web series “Ladies Like Us.” Westwick rose to fame on the hit CW soap playing bad boy Chuck Bass, a character with his own history of sexual assault . He now stars on the BBC Two series “White Gold.” Cohen said the wave of sexual assault allegations leveled against powerful men in Hollywood pushed her to come forward with her story now. She hopes to change the public perception of men like Westwick and encourage other victims of sexual assault never to blame themselves. “I’m sickened to see men like Ed respected in such a public way. Interviewed by prestigious platforms such as the Oxford Union Society at Oxford University, where he was honored as one of their ‘People who Shape our World,’” Cohen wrote. “How does this end? Men like Ed using fame and power to rape and intimidate but then continue through the world collecting accolades.” “I hope that my stories and the stories of others help to reset and realign the toxic environments and power imbalances that have created these monsters,” she concluded.

Princess Michael of Kent, 72, attended the gathering wearing a brooch featuring a miniature bust of an African woman embellished with gold and colorful jewels. What made the fashion choice especially awkward was that Meghan Markle , Prince Harry’s fiancée who is half black and half white , was a guest at the holiday lunch. The event marked the first time Markle, who will become Princess Henry of Wales when she and Prince Harry wed in May, had met many of the Royal Family’s extended family , according to People magazine. In a statement to People and the Daily Mail , a spokeswoman for Princess Michael said that the brooch was a gift she had worn “many times before.” “Princess Michael is very sorry and distressed that it has caused offense,” the statement read. The imagery worn by Princess Michael is a European art style known as blackamoor that dates back to the 16h century . It depicts the bodies and faces of dark-skinned people from North Africa and the Middle East, according to New York University. The style of art is now considered dated, offensive and a fetishization of black people, which often romanticizes slavery. Dolce & Gabbana faced fierce criticism after it debuted a 2013 spring collection featuring blackamoor earrings and prints. “Blackamoor imagery in general reflects trends in decorative arts that recall the history of slaves in Europe and the disturbing manner in which the European luxury culture objectified black bodies as mere ornament,” wrote news site The Root of the luxury brand’s controversial collection in 2012. Although Princess Michael’s statement suggests that she did not intend to offend anyone with her brooch, the Christmas lunch isn’t the first time she has been accused of being racially insensitive. In 2004, while out dining in New York City, she reportedly yelled “go back to the colonies” to a table of black diners, The New York Times reported at the time. Markle has not publicly responded to the controversy surrounding Princess Michael’s brooch, but she has been vocal in the past about the racism she and her family have faced . Markle described a number of awkward and hurtful experiences she’s had in a 2016 column for Elle magazine, including the time when her mom was called “the ‘N’ word:” I was home in LA on a college break when my mom was called the ‘N’ word. We were leaving a concert and she wasn’t pulling out of a parking space quickly enough for another driver. My skin rushed with heat as I looked to my mom. Her eyes welling with hateful tears, I could only breathe out a whisper of words, so hushed they were barely audible: ‘It’s OK, Mommy.’ I was trying to temper the rage-filled air permeating our small silver Volvo.",62.72,10.8,12.6,480,480,"lunch

The 23-year-old had already made history earlier in the competition when she was the first North Dakota contestant to be named a top 5 finalist, according to People magazine . Only three previous Miss North Dakota competitors had reached the top 10. In a video posted to Twitter after the competition, Mund said she was honored to win the crown. Over the four-night competition, the women were judged based on evening wear, fitness, lifestyle, talent and interview categories. During the interview, Mund was asked about the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris accord on climate change. She said she believed leaving the agreement was the wrong decision. “There is evidence that climate change is existing,” she said. “So whether you believe it or not, we need to be at that [negotiation] table, and I just think it’s a bad decision on behalf of the United States.” Miss Missouri Jennifer Davis was named the pageant’s first runner-up.",62.88,8.7,11.9,202,202,"miss
