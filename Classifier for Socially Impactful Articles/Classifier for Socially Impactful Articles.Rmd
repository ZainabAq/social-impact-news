# Introduction

Our team used articles from a major Online news publication and tried to create a tool that could automatically classify socially impactful articles from those that are not based on several aspects of the article. These aspects included the article’s presence in social media (e.g. number of likes, shares, etc.), level of readability and the sentiments associated with the words used.

We define socially impactful as a _. Therefore, some impacts that the article can have on readers are changing the way they think, leaving an impression, or reaffirming their ideas. It could also make readers change their habits or actions based on what they have read.

We used the `tidytext` package’s `AFINN` lexicon for our sentiment analysis. `AFINN` consists of around 2500 words and phrases scored between -5 to +5. The number between 1 to 5 reflects the severity of the word and the signs imply the positivity of the word. 

We scraped the articles of its text, broke up the text into individual words and omitted any commonly used words that should be ignored (e.g. “the”, “and”, “is”) from the text. Then, the text was inspected for words that fell into any of the 10 categories between -5 to +5 (0 was omitted). By using this method, we were able to add a column for -5 to -1 and +1 to +5 and label what percent of all words used in the article (after taking out the stop words) fell into each category of ratings. This was an effort to get an idea of what sentiments were present in the article.

However, one limitation of this sentiment analysis is the fact that this analysis was only done for one word each. Therefore, words that go together may not be accounted for. In addition, the system is unable to recognize the difference between word-usage depending on the context. For example, if an article was referring to “swift” as a name, the sentiment analysis will not be able to distinguish it from the adjective “swift” which is given a rating of +2. Therefore, the +2 word percentage rate will increase due to the word usage in the text, even though it is not part of the rating.

Overall, words rated higher on the scale of 1-5 (i.e. +5 and -5) were not as prevalent in the articles, which makes sense given the extremities of the words. The words were more common as the scales became lower (i.e. 1-3).

_(to be changed due to changes in data + variables/model)_
We fit a stepwise logistic regression as another measure to determine if an article was socially impactful or not. The model included the sentiment variables of -1 to -3 and +1 to +2, presence in social media (i.e. social interactions), smog index and length of the article (i.e. total number of words). All were significant (p-value < 0.05) and the model had a McFadden’s R-squared of 0.143. In addition, the logistic regression had an area under the curve of 0.820.

This model was cross-validated, and we noticed that the model had a sensitivity of 0.47 but a specificity of 0.91. Therefore, it does a very good job of classifying non-socially impactful articles but does not perform well in classifying socially impactful articles. We are currently working on first classifying non-socially impactful articles using this logistic regression, then taking the articles classified as “socially impactful” and re-fitting another model for it for better accuracy. We will need to be careful of overfitting, however, and we should proceed with caution.
